Jadeveon_Clowney 2543456 1
Was USA Today's National Defensive Player of the Year, a Parade Magazine All-America selection and the state of South Carolina's "Mr. Football" in 2010, finishing his storied senior season with 162 tackles, 29 tackles for loss and 29.5 sacks with 11 forced fumbles and five defensive touchdowns. Also played part-time at running back. Arrived on campus in 2011, appearing in 13 games (one start) as a true freshman and tallying 36 tackles, 12 tackles for loss and eight sacks with one pass batted and five forced fumbles. Was selected as the SEC's Freshman of the Year. Finished sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting in 2012 and was the SEC's Defensive Player of the Year after registering 54 tackles, 23.5 tackles for loss and 13 sacks with two passes batted and three forced fumbles in 12 starts at defensive end. Was just the second Gamecocks sophomore to earn unanimous All-America honors, joining George Rogers (1980). Set school single-season records in tackles for loss and sacks and a school single-game mark with a 4.5-sack performance against Clemson. Missed one game, sitting against Wofford to rest an ailing foot. In 11 games in 2013, he had 40 tackles, 11.5 tackles for loss and three sacks with four passes batted and one forced fumble. Missed two games with injuries (bone spurs in foot, muscle strain near rib area). Had a pair of well-publicized speeding citations in December 2013 (going 110 mph in a 70 mph zone and 84 mph in a 55 mph zone). Concluded his three-year college career with 47 tackles for loss, 24 sacks and nine forced fumbles in 36 games.
Is more thinly built in the lower body. Inconsistent technician. Has a tendency to play tall. Down-to-down effort lacks consistency. Lacks discipline on and off the field and has had to be managed closely since he arrived on campus. Needs to learn what it means to be a pro. Plays in spurts and is too much of a flash player -- does not consistently dominate like he could. Is still immature and finding his way -- too much of a follower.
Looks every bit the part with long arms (big wingspan) and large hands. Athletic marvel with raw explosive power and rare speed for his size. Is physically tough and will battle through injuries. Can collapse the corner with ease and rag-dolls blockers. Highly disruptive -- creates a lot of pressure and flushes production to his teammates. Can split the double team and closes in a hiccup. Plays with leverage and power in his hands -- converts speed into power and bulls blockers into the backfield. Disrupts a quarterback's vision with long arms and can bat down balls. Seldom leaves the field. Flashes playmaking ability and can produce athletic feats in a category with few others before him. Posted a 37 1/2-inch vertical jump and 10-foot-4 broad jump at the combine. Versatile -- lines up everywhere along the line and can win with strength, power, quickness and speed. Has the personality of a pleaser and does not like to disappoint coaches or teammates. Exceptional pro day positional workout, showing rare speed, athletic ability, bend and explosion for a man his size.
Round 1 (top 10)
A physical specimen with a rare size-speed combination, --NAME-- was not as impactful as a junior while playing through injuries and being forced to deal with opposing offenses that fully accounted for him with extra chip protection. Was a 20-year-old junior affected by turnover on the defensive coaching staff. Could benefit tremendously from a stable positional coach and strong, veteran mentor on the defensive line who will hold him accountable, show him the way and serve as a father figure. Is one of the most unique talents in the draft and could easily be a double-digit sack producer in the pros from either end. Is every bit worthy of the first overall pick and will immediately upgrade a defensive line and improve the production of those around him.

Sammy_Watkins 2543457 4
Brother, Jaylen, played cornerback at Florida (2010-13). --NAME-- was an elite recruit out of Florida, where he also won the AA state title in the 200 meters and finished second in the 100 meters. In 2011, was just the fourth first-year freshman in NCAA history to garner AP first-team All-America recognition, joining Herschel Walker, Marshall Faulk and Adrian Peterson -- started 10-of-13 games and produced 82 receptions for 1,219 yards (14.9-yard average) and 12 touchdowns. Hurt his right shoulder against Wake Forest and sat out against North Carolina State. In May '12 was charged with two counts of misdemeanor possession when he was pulled over and found to have marijuana and pills he didn't have a prescription for (expunged upon completion of pre-trial intervention). In the fall, served a two-game suspension before starting 7-of-10 games played and managing 57-708-3 (12.4) opposite Texans '13 first-rounder DeAndre Hopkins. Did not play against Boston College (abdominal virus) and was knocked out of the Chick-fil-A Bowl against LSU on the second play (right ankle). Started 12-of-13 games in '13, racking up 101-1,464-12 (14.5), including 16-227-2 against Ohio State in the Orange Bowl. For his career, also returned 60 kickoffs for 1,376 yards (22.9), including a score, and returned punts 9-23 (2.6). Added 52 rushes for 339 yards (5.3) and a touchdown. Owns 23 Clemson records, including career receptions (240), receiving yards (3,391) and touchdowns (27, tied with Hopkins).
Production results heavily from a gimmicky offense. Routes could use some more polish. Does not consistently work the middle of the field. Could improve field awareness. Is still immature and could require some time to acclimate to an NFL playbook. Could stand to improve ball security and do a better job fielding punts.
Exceptional football playing speed -- can flat out fly and take the top off a defense. Has world-class track speed. Extends outside his frame and plucks the ball. Outstanding body control and agility. Tracks the ball well over his shoulder and is a natural hands-catcher who can make an average quarterback look good. Consistently turns 2-yard gains into 15-yard chunks -- possesses big-time playmaking ability and is very effective creating in the open field on bubble screens and quick-hitting short/lateral tosses. Superb run-after-the-catch ability. Good burst out of his cuts to separate. Has game-breaking return ability and is a threat to score every time he touches the ball. Has a strong support structure (mother moved to Clemson following Wakins' 2012 drug arrest and he has steered clear of any trouble). Will be a 21-year-old rookie.
Round 1 (top 10)
A legitimate Number 1-caliber receiver who stepped onto the field as a true freshman and made an immediate, game-changing impact. Was slowed by injuries as a sophomore, but responded with a strong junior season and capped his career as one of the most impactful receivers in school history. Has rare speed, soft hands and the big-play ability to challenge NFL defensive backs as a rookie.
-------------------------
Greg_Robinson 2543458 2
Highly recruited out of Louisiana, where he was a state champion shot putter. Redshirted in 2011. Started 11-of-12 games played at left tackle in '12 -- was benched against Alabama A&M. In '13, started all 14 games at left tackle for the national runners-up. Has a right meniscus surgery on his medical record. Left school early to support his family -- his father passed away in April '13, his mother struggles to make ends meet and he has four siblings, two of which have been incarcerated for selling drugs.
Could stand to refine his technique in pass protection and do a better job finishing blocks. At times will quit after contact and let defenders come underneath or get over the top -- handwork is too passive. Developing eyes and awareness vs. the blitz -- still learning how to adjust to overload pressure and could improve switching off blocks. Aggressively overextends and occasionally loses balance and falls off blocks.
Has long arms and excellent overall body mass. Outstanding run blocker with the strength and power to wash down half of the line. Creates a surge and generates power from his lower body. Good get-off and body control. Excellent reach-blocking, chipping and releasing to the second level. Very good balance in his set and is quick to cut off the rush. Can maneuver his hips, shuffle, slide and mirror. Has a strong punch and replaces his hands. Very athletic in vertical sets.
Round 1 (top 10)
Big, strong, athletic, overpowering left tackle with the raw potential to become a premiere, franchise left tackle. Is only a third-year sophomore and two-year starter and still must improve his hand use, footwork and technique. However, he is undeniably gifted and capable of walking into a starting-left-tackle job in the pros and paving the way in the run game.
-------------------------
Anthony_Barr 2543459 9
Born in South Bend, Ind., and raised in a Notre Dame family: His father, Tony Brooks, played fullback at Notre Dame and was drafted by the Eagles in the fourth round of the 1992 draft; uncle, Reggie Brooks, played running back at ND, was fifth in the 1992 Heisman voting and played 41 games with the Redskins and Buccaneers (1993-96); and uncle Cedric Figaro played linebacker for the Irish as well as 98 games for the Chargers, Colts, Browns and Rams (1988-92, 1995-96). --NAME-- grew up in Los Angeles and was raised by his mother, who is part of a large extended family, including --NAME--'s grandparents, who were like second parents to him. Ran track and was an all-state running back in high school, totaling 1,890 yards and 20 touchdowns as a junior (dealt with hip pointers) before suffering a season-ending broken ankle in September of his senior season. According to --NAME--, he felt effects of the injury through his freshman season. Highly recruited, he spurned Notre Dame, not wanting to play receiver, and signed with UCLA and then-head coach Rick Neuheisel in order to play running back and remain close to home. As a true freshman in 2010, rushed six times for 29 yards (4.8-yard average) and no touchdowns with nine receptions for 66 yards (7.3) and no touchdowns in 12 games, including four starts at the Bruins' F-back (hybrid running back/tight end/receiver). Started 7 of 12 games played at the F-back in 2011, rushing nine times for 25 yards and a TD and three catches for 16 yards and a TD. Had arthroscopic surgery to repair cartilage damage in his right knee and missed three October contests. Converted to 3-4 right outside linebacker under new head coach Jim Mora Jr., then-defensive coordinator Lou Spanos and linebackers coach Jeff Ulbrich (current DC). Sustained a head injury during 2012 fall camp and began the season with a cast protecting a broken left index finger. Started all 14 games and ranked second nationally in sacks behind Steelers 2013 first-rounder Jarvis Jones; recorded 83 tackles, 21.5 for loss and 13.5 sacks with five pass breakups, four forced fumbles, a blocked kick and a safety. Dealt a season-ending blow to USC quarterback and 2013 Eagles fourth-rounder Matt Barkley. Sustained a head injury during 2013 fall camp but started all 13 games at ROLB and registered 65 tackles, 20 tackles for loss and 10 sacks with a pass breakup and five forced fumbles. Won the Lott IMPACT award and was a finalist for the Lombardi, Bednarik and Butkus awards. Team captain. Was invited but did not participate in the Senior Bowl.
Developing instincts -- late to locate the ball and too easily fooled by play-action and misdirection. Motor runs hot and cold -- does not always apply himself. Can be locked down too easily when engaged -- unrefined hand use. Lacks variety of pass-rush moves and relies too much on natural speed. Average eyes, anticipation and awareness in coverage ' marginal feel. Average base strength -- moved off the ball too easily by tight ends (plays tall). Needs more time in the weight room -- 15 bench-press reps were tied for the fewest among linebackers at the combine.
Exceptional take-off speed, acceleration and closing burst. Makes plays effortlessly in back-side lateral pursuit. Outstanding recovery quickness to make plays (when he is out of position). Explosive striker. Can produce "wow" plays when he triggers quickly or releases cleanly and has developed a reputation for knocking quarterbacks out of games (see USC, 2012 and New Mexico State, 2013).
Round 1 (top 10)
A highly disruptive, athletic specimen with the pass-rush potential to effortlessly emerge as a double-digit sack producer. Is far from a finished product and his best football is still ahead of him, yet he plays the game with more of an offensive temperament and could require some patience. Is the type of rare athlete that could even contribute as an offensive playmaker once he learns to grasp defensive concepts and the game slows down for him.
-------------------------
Timmy_Jernigan 2543461 48
Highly recruited Florida prep. The true freshman saw action in all 13 games as a reserve in 2011 and led interior linemen with 30 tackles, six tackles for loss and 2.5 sacks. Was sidelined during '12 spring practice with a sprained MCL and slight meniscus tear. Backed up Cowboys 2013 seventh-rounder Everett Dawkins for a second-straight season in the fall, logging 45-8-1.5 in 13 games with two starts. His '13 spring practice was cut short by an ankle injury. Was healthy in the fall and had 63-11-4.5 in 14 starts at nose tackle, his only season as a starter. Led the Noles in tackles for loss. Battled an illness in the National Championship Game against Auburn and had nine tackles.
Has a fleshy midsection. Lacks ideal height and overall body length. Average get-off. Can be overpowered at the point or neutralized when bigger, longer blockers get into his frame. Limited two-gap ability. Average playing range. Stiff-legged and does not change direction easily, as confirmed by 4.84-second 20-yard shuttle time at the combine (tied for slowest among DTs). Could stand to improve his stamina. Was a rotational player prior to junior season.
Strong for his size and clogs the middle. Has disruptive ability. Bends his knees and plays with leverage. Able to stack, locate and shed. Wraps and rips down ball carriers. Coordinated hands and feet. Is difficult to engage -- has quick, active paws. Can slap, rip and swim to beat blockers and turns up the heat on passing downs. Good foot athlete for his size -- changes direction well, gives effort in pursuit and ranges outside the box. Will be a 21-year-old rookie.
Rounds 1-2 (top 50)
Slightly undersized, stoutly built, country-strong run stopper with the ability to drop anchor inside an odd front and develop into a solid, 3-4 movement nose tackle. Strength is his calling card despite his relatively modest size.
-------------------------
Johnny_Manziel 2543462 22
The Texas prep was named a Parade All-American after throwing 45 touchdown passes and rushing for 30 more as a senior. Redshirted in 2011. In June 2012, was arrested and charged with three misdemeanors after breaking up a fight with a friend; he pleaded guilty to a charge of failure to identify, and the other two charges were dropped. Burst onto the scene in the fall, becoming the first freshman to win the Heisman Trophy, the Davey O'Brien Award and the Manning Award after completing 295 of 434 passes for 3,706 yards (68.0 percent) with 26 touchdowns and nine interceptions in 13 starts. Also rushed 201 times for 1,410 yards (7.0-yard average) and 21 touchdowns. Became the only player in NCAA history to have 5,000 total yards and 1,000 rushing yards in a season and set the SEC record with 5,116 yards of total offense. Was scheduled to be a counselor at the Manning Passing Academy in July 2013 but was dismissed after oversleeping and missing meetings. Missed the first half of the season opener against Rice after being suspended for what the school and NCAA called an "inadvertent violation" of NCAA rules pertaining to if he accepted money for autographs. Had a stellar redshirt sophomore season in 2013, going 300-of-429 for 4,114 yards (70.0) with 37 TDs and 13 INTs and rushing 144 times for 759 yards (5.3) and nine TDs in 13 games (12 starts). Set at least 35 NCAA, SEC or school records in his two-year career. Had a 19-6 career record in 25 starts.
Has an unorthodox body type with marginal height, rounded shoulders and an underdeveloped body. Will need to learn to do a better job protecting his body and sliding. Feels pocket ghosts and often takes off running at the first flash of coverage. Undisciplined -- plays his own offense and presses to make plays. Cannot see over the pocket easily and almost never steps up into it, creating extra difficulties for OL coaches to coordinate blocking schemes and for offensive linemen to anticipate where the pocket will be. Dances around the pocket too much and creates needless sacks rolling into protection when the pocket is clean. Struggled vs. LSU and Missouri when he was forced to stay inside the pocket. Has not worked from under center, and footwork and set-up will require refinement. Often throws the ball up in the air and relies on big receivers to adjust to it and make plays, highly benefiting from the playmaking ability of a talented supporting cast featuring Mike Evans and an offensive line stocked with first-round talent. Tends to overshoot the deep ball and throw off his back foot, leading to some underthrows (too many dirtballs on the move) and diminished accuracy. Needlessly pats the ball when he scans the field. Could stand to do a better job carrying out play-action fakes. Has not developed a reputation as a worker or for doing the extras. Suspect intangibles -- not a leader by example or known to inspire by his words. Carries a sense of entitlement and prima-donna arrogance seeking out the bright lights of Hollywood. Is known to party too much and is drawn to all the trappings of the game. Lacks ideal starting experience (only two years), operated a non-traditional offense and has a lot to learn.
Has big hands and grips the ball well on the move. Dynamic athlete. Exceptional game-day competitor -- rises to the occasion. Has a passion for the game. Played on the biggest of stages and revels in having his back against the wall. Stepped up against a national championship Alabama defense in 2012 and has proven he can command come-from-behind victories, as he capped his career in the Chick-fil-A bowl vs. Duke by overcoming a 21-point halftime deficit. Sufficient timing, ball placement and accuracy (68.9 percent career passing percentage). Terrific scrambling ability. Reverse spins and buys time in the pocket while continuing to scan the field -- can still set his feet, alter his throwing motion and manipulate his arm and throwing platform. Houdini-like escapability (uses subtle, nifty sidestep moves) and improvisational ability in the pocket to pull a rabbit out of his hat and create magic. Has peripheral, wide-eyed running vision (sometimes appears to have eyes in back of his head) and a very good feel for spacing. Carries the ball with a fearless confidence that he will find a way to create and usually gains positive yardage on broken plays when he appears trapped. Is mentally and physically tough -- will pop back up from hard collisions and respond to a challenge. Record-setting and award-winning two-year production. Has a knack for sustaining drives and possesses playmaking ability to create on third downs and in critical situations to keep the sticks moving. Exceptional pro day performance, displaying much improved footwork in the pocket, superb deep-ball accuracy and arm strength and supreme confidence on a big stage.
Rounds 1-2
A once-in-a-generation, run-around, ad-lib, sandlot-style quarterback who consistently won games playing a brand of fast-paced, jailbreak football that often goes off script and can be difficult both to game plan with and against. Is most comfortable on the move outside the pocket where he can find open throwing lanes and see the field and will command mush rush and extra spy defenders. Has defied the odds and proven to be a great college-system quarterback, but still must prove he is willing to work to be great, adjust his hard-partying, Hollywood lifestyle and be able to inspire his teammates by more than his playmaking ability. Overall character, leadership ability and work habits will define his NFL career. Rare competitiveness and third-down efficiency could carry him a long way, yet he could be challenged to avoid a crash-and-burn scenario if he does not settle down and mature. A high-risk, high-reward pick, --NAME-- stands to benefit from entering the NFL at a time when moving pockets are trending. No other quarterback can change the tempo of a game better if a demanding head coach feels confident he can manage the risk.
-------------------------
Khalil_Mack 2543463 5
Prepped in Florida, where he was primarily a basketball player until his senior year -- Buffalo was only FBS offer. Tore his patellar tendon as an underclassman. Redshirted in 2009. Played outside linebacker in a 3-4 for the Bulls, and started all 48 games he played. In '10, played 12 games and recorded 68 tackles, 14.5 for loss and 4.5 sacks with 10 pass breakups and two forced fumbles. In '11, tallied 65-20.5-5.5 with two pass breakups, an interception and five forced fumbles. Was suspended for the '12 season opener against Georgia after he got into a fight with a teammate. On the season, totaled 94-21-8 with two pass breakups and four forced fumbles in 12 games. Was a Butkus Award finalist in '13 when he led the Bulls in tackling for the second year in a row -- registered 100-19-10.5 with seven pass breakups, three interceptions (two returned for touchdowns) and five forced fumbles in 13 games. Team captain. Three-time first-team All-MAC.
Produced nondescript performance with a MAC title game berth on the line vs. Bowling Green and regularly faced inferior MAC competion. Plays a bit too recklessly and out of control. Can learn to run the arc with better lean.
Disruptive first-step quickness -- immediately re-creates the line of scrimmage and plays in the backfield (record tackle-for-loss production). Outstanding instincts -- locates the ball quickly and is around the ball a lot. Very good body control, bend and balance -- plays on his feet and is seldom on the ground. Developed pass-rush moves (rip, dip and inside counter). Very explosive -- broad jumped 10 feet, 8 inches and boasts a rare 40-inch vertical. Excellent pursuit -- tracks down ball carriers from behind. Sacrifices his body and sells out around piles. Strikes with authority -- hits on the rise, violently jars ball carriers backward on impact and has a knack for dislodging the ball. Highly motivated. Played big vs. better competition (see Ohio State). Can zone drop and buzz to the flat with ease. Highly competitive and energetic. Regularly was the focus of defensive game plans and still produced despite facing multiple blockers and extra protection consistently rolled his way.
Round 1 (top 10)
A havoc-wreaking rush linebacker with the burst and acceleration to excel as a right defensive end in a "40" front, --NAME-- has demonstrated the instincts, toughness, athletic ability and explosive power to line up at any linebacker position in an even or odd front and factor readily. Is a four-year starter who made an immediate impact upon his arrival and is well primed for the NFL game. Looks every bit the part, comes from a humble, grounded family and offers the full package to become an impact performer in the pros.
-------------------------
C.J._Mosley 2543464 17
Alabama native amassed more than 500 tackles in his high school career, garnering Parade All-American honors as a senior. Started all 13 games as a true freshman, starting three at Mike (strong inside) linebacker, and recorded 69 tackles, 1.5-.5 with 10 pass breakups and two interception touchdowns. Started 6-of-11 games played at weak inside linebacker in '11 and tallied 37-4.5-2 with two pass breakups and an interception. Dislocated his right elbow against Arkansas and sat out against Florida and Vanderbilt. Played all 14 games in '12, starting nine as the Tide's Will 'backer in sub packages, and produced 107-8-4 with two pass breakups, two interceptions and a forced fumble. Suffered a dislocated hip in the BCS Championship Game against LSU, then had offseason shoulder surgery to repair a torn right labrum. Won the Butkus Award (nation's top linebacker) and was the SEC Defensive Player of the Year (coaches) in '13 -- started all 13 games at weak inside linebacker and was Alabama's leading tackler for the second consecutive season, racking up 108-9-0 with five pass breakups and a forced fumble. Also was a finalist for the Lombardi and Nagurski awards. Team captain won a pair of national championships. Did not bench press or run the 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine because of a right shoulder injury.
Has a narrow build. Has been slowed by elbow, hip and shoulder injuries throughout his career and long-term durability will require thorough inspection by medical examiners. Gets hung up on the blitz (shoulder stiffness) and must learn how to use more finesse picking a side instead of relying on bull power and striking blockers down the middle. Can learn to do a better job shooting his hands to shock defenders and disengage from blocks. Could be challenged matching up down the field with his back to the ball vs. flex TEs in the slot (man coverage). Could stand to become a more vocal leader.
Exceptional instincts -- triggers fast downhill. Outstanding urgency. Plays with very good knee bend, balance and base. Secure, drive-through tackler. Hits with explosion and jars ball carriers on impact. Excellent lateral agility -- flows fast and ranges to the sideline. Exceptional weight-room worker with good functional play strength -- plays bigger than his size. Outstanding eyes and anticipation vs. the run. Very good coverage awareness with the ball in front of him -- clings to tight ends passing through zones and blankets speed backs in man coverage. Respected leadership presence -- lines up his teammates and directs traffic. Film junkie. Excellent attitude, effort, field intensity and overall energy. Exceptional football and personal character. Highly competitive. Humble, selfless team player. Outstanding football IQ. Scheme-diverse and versatile. Strong special-teams coverage performer.
Round 1 (top 15)
Smart, instinctive, fast-flowing, every-down linebacker capable of manning any position in a "40" front or steering a defense from the weak side in a "30" front, where he starred for a national-championship defense as a junior and carried the Tide as a senior. Has the football temperament, desire and work habits to emerge as a tackling machine in the pros. Has Pro Bowl potential.
-------------------------
Teddy_Bridgewater 2543465 32
The dual-threat QB was a three-year starter for Miami (Fla.) powerhouse Northwestern High School. Named Big East Freshman of the Year in 2011 after completing 191-of-296 passes for 2,195 yards (64.5 percent) with 14 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in 13 games (started final 10 games). Became the first true freshman to start at QB for Louisville since Stu Stram in 1976. Threw for 287-419-3,718-27-8 (68.5) while playing in all 13 games (12 starts) in '12 to earn conference's Offensive Player of the Year Award. Only non-start was due to a fractured left wrist and a sprained right ankle suffered against UConn in which he returned to the field in a triple-overtime loss and nearly rallied a victory, as he did vs. Rutgers the following week to claim a BCS bid. Produced another stellar campaign in '13, tossing 303-427-3,970-31-4 (71.0) in 13 starts. Earned his sports administration degree in three years and graduated in December. Scored six career rushing touchdowns and had a 27-8 record in 35 games as a starter in offensive coordinator Shawn Watson's college-tailored, pro-style, West Coast offense.
Has a very lean, narrow frame with limited bulk and small hands. Does not drive the ball with velocity down the field and can be affected by cold and windy conditions (see Cincinnati). Can improve placement and touch on the deep ball. Adequate athlete. Is not an overly elusive scrambler -- struggles escaping the rush and buying a second chance with his feet vs. pressure. Passing stats are padded from operating a passing game that relies heavily on short, lateral tosses. Long-term durability could become a concern without continued strength and weight gains.
Terrific competitor. Extremely driven to succeed. Well-prepared and confident in his approach. Operated a progression-read offense where he is asked to scan the whole field and help steer protections. Footwork is very clean and in rhythm -- throws on balance with sound mechanics, a fluid delivery and smooth stroke. Very good timing, touch and anticipation ' throws receivers open. Is patient working through his reads and will step up in the pocket. Sells play-action hard and takes what the defense gives him. Poised in the face of the blitz and often anticipates it coming. Is very mentally and physically tough ' played through a broken left wrist with a sprained ankle in what was essentially the 2012 Big East championship game, coming off the bench to captain the Cardinals to a come-from-behind victory. Is a student of the game with a very good understanding of football concepts. Plays like a coach on the field, knows the responsibilities of everyone on the field and can get teammates lined up correctly. Makes few mental errors. Consistently moves the chains and comes through in the clutch. Is given a lot of autonomy to make pre-snap reads and adjustments at the line of scrimmage and understands how to exploit defenses. Meticulous in his preparation. Identifies with the game and really works at his craft. Smart, determined and focused. Showed gradual improvement every season. Is only 21 years old -- very mature for his age and can see the big picture. Football is extremely important to him. Highly respected, unselfish team leader.  Rises to the occasion on big stages.
Round 1
A calculated, football-smart, precision-matchup rhythm passer, --NAME-- would be best suited entering a warm-weather or dome environment such as those most common in the South divisions. Would stand to benefit heavily from operating a short, dink-and-dunk rhythm passing game. Compensates for a lack of elite arm talent and prototype measureables with the intangibles and football intelligence that could elevate the other 52 players around him. Instinctive passer with the laser-beam determination to become a Pro Bowl-caliber passer in the right system.
-------------------------
Eric_Ebron 2543466 10
Prepped in North Carolina. As a true freshman in 2011, appeared in 10 games (one start) and tallied 10 receptions for 207 yards (20.7-yard average) and a touchdown. Did not play in the Independence Bowl against Missouri (academics). Started 11-of-12 games in '12, catching 40-625-4 (15.6). In '13, set the ACC single-season record for yards by a tight end -- started 11-of-13 games and totaled 62-973-3 (15.7), breaking Vernon Davis' conference record for receiving yards. Hurt his right shoulder and was limited against Old Dominion. Strained his right hamstring on his second 40-yard dash attempt at the NFL Scouting Combine and did not perform shuttles or drills.
Lacks ideal bulk. Can improve as a blocker, both in-line and on the move -- could stand to improve technique, physicality and finish. Not equipped to lock horns with NFL defensive ends. Inconsistent adjusting to and fitting on moving targets. Could stand to play with more consistent intensity and focus. Makes the occasional concentration drop. Ordinary touchdown production. Can be loud, boisterous and overly egotistical, which will rub some people the wrong way.
Releases cleanly and accelerates into patterns. Outstanding athletic ability and receiving skills. Threatens every level. Advanced route runner. Pierces the seam and is a mismatch vs. man coverage -- regularly bested defensive backs. Terrific quickness, agility, balance and body control. Catches cleanly off his frame. Makes one-handed grabs look routine. Wide catching radius. Catches on the move and has an extra gear to pile up yards. Excellent production. Will be a 21-year-old rookie.
Round 1
Highly athletic, highly productive "F" tight end loaded with upside and mismatch capability. Possesses the speed, movement skills, hands and run-after-catch skills to emerge as a playmaking weapon in the pros, though has room to continue developing as a blocker.
-------------------------
Taylor_Lewan 2543467 11
Prepped in Arizona, where he transferred to Chaparral High as a senior and won a state championship while playing offensive line for the first time (defensive end previously). Redshirted in 2009. In '10, overtook upperclassman Mark Huyge in Week Four -- started nine of the final 10 games at left tackle, sitting out against Wisconsin (head). Started all 39 games at LT 2011-13, winning the Big Ten Rimington-Pace Offensive Lineman of the Year award his last two seasons. Team captain. Faces three misdemeanor charges for allegedly assaulting two Ohio State fans during a Dec. 1 altercation. Was invited, but did not participate in the Senior Bowl.
Is not a gritty, physical finisher. Has a lean lower body and does not explode on contact. Can be inverted by power and does not carry a load in his hands. Could do a better job recognizing and adjusting to the outside blitz. Quirky personality that can be easily misunderstood.
Accomplished, four-year starter vs. Big Ten competition. Clean kickslide in pass protection. Good knee bend, footwork and recovery quickness to handle outside speed and inside counters. Very good balance ' is seldom on the ground. Is quick climbing to the second level to reach linebackers. Plays with intensity and the game is very important to him. Tough and very durable. Produced the best 40-yard time (4.79 seconds) and broad jump (9-foot-9) of any offensive lineman at the combine.
Round 1
An experienced, finesse left tackle with the length, agility and temperament to hold down a starting job for a long time. Is nuanced in pass protection and would fit best in a slide-lateral movement, bucket-stepping, zone-based blocking scheme. Similar in mold to Patriots 2011 17th overall selection Nate Solder. Outstanding combine performance could elevate his draft status.
-------------------------
Mike_Evans 2543468 7
His father, Mickey, was murdered when --NAME-- was 9. Native Texan who only played one season of varsity football. Averaged 18 points, eight rebounds and five assists on the hardwood and was considered a Division I basketball recruit. Redshirted in 2011. Started all 26 games in 2012-13 and was the Aggies' leading receiver both seasons. Catching passes from quarterback Johnny Manziel, racked up 82 catches for 1,105 yards (13.5-yard average) and five touchdowns in 2012 and 69 receptions for 1,394 yards (20.2) and 12 touchdowns in 2013.
Monotone mover with pedestrian speed. Cannot separate vertically or pull away from the pack. Unsudden acceleration. Stiff hips. Will have to make a living in traffic at the next level. Will struggle to separate vs. quick-twitch NFL cornerbacks. Did not run a full route tree and could require patience learning the nuances of refined route running. Backyard element to his college success -- must become savvier instead of depending on superior size and improvisational production. Can be hotheaded and lose control of his emotions. Basketball was first love.
Outstanding size and length. Functionally strong to power through the jam. Boxes out defenders and is a big red-zone target. Hardwood background is evident -- outstanding leaper with "above-the-rim" skills to go over top of smaller DBs and highpoint throws. Creates late, subtle separation. Tracks and adjusts. Makes contested grabs -- attacks throws and outmuscles defenders in a crowd. Nearly unstoppable executing back-shoulder catches. Strong, reliable hands. Very strong after the catch -- slams into tacklers, is a load to bring down and leans for extra yardage. Productive playmaker -- averaged 20 yards per catch in 2013 and showed up in big games (18-566-5 vs. Alabama and Auburn). Good blocker. Physically dominant and tough. Will be a 21-year-old rookie.
Round 1 (top 15)
A prep hoopster with shooting-guard size, --NAME-- combined with Johnny Manziel to form one of the most dominant quarterback-receiver connections in the nation the last two seasons. He's a big, physical, strong-handed, West Coast possession receiver with playmaking ability who projects as a Number 2 in the pros, where he will make his money as a chain mover and red-zone target.
-------------------------
Calvin_Pryor 2543469 18
Played safety and running back as a Florida prep. Arrived at Louisville in 2011 and appeared in all 13 games as a true freshman -- started the final seven contests at free safety. Immediately made his presence felt, recording 43 tackles, five pass breakups and two interceptions with three tackles for loss, one sack and two forced fumbles. Finished second on the team in tackles in '12, starting 13 times and recording 100-5-2 with 2.5 tackles for loss, one sack and a team-best five forced fumbles. In '13, totaled 75-5-3 with 5.5 tackles for loss and two forced fumbles in 12 games. Had a three-game stretch of knocking opposing players out of a contest. Missed the only game of his collegiate career Nov. 23 vs. Memphis, as he was suspended for a violation of an unspecified team rule. Did not run shuttles or 3-cone drill at the NFL Scouting Combine (right toe).
Plays with too much reckless abandon and lacks discipline playing the cutback. Takes some bad angles and can be outflanked to the perimeter. Average production on the ball. Is not asked to play a lot of man coverage. Average leaping ability.
Carries a swagger and plays with confidence. Runs the alley and throws his weight around. Physical, lights-out hitter (see second defensive snap of UCF game). Made a highlight-reel, one-handed INT in the same game. Instinctive and aggressive. Defensive tempo-setter. Good pre-snap recognition ' makes adjustments. Can leverage the field off the hash and cover ground. Good zone recognition. Rangy enough to play center field.
Round 1 (top 15)
Perhaps the most explosive hitter in this year's crop of safeties, --NAME-- is a big, physical hammer in the run game, bringing the ability to intimidate and erase. Factor in his instincts and range and --NAME-- has the ability to start as a rookie.
-------------------------
Ha_Ha_Clinton-Dix 2543470 21
His full name is --NAME--'Sean --NAME--. Elite recruit out of Florida, where he doubled as a running back and kick returner. Played in 13 games for Alabama as a true freshman in '11 and recorded 11 tackles and two pass breakups. Was a key performer for the national champions in '12, appearing in all 14 games (10 starts) at safety. --NAME--d 37 tackles, four pass breakups and five interceptions with one-half tackle for loss and one forced fumble. Tied for the SEC lead in interceptions, including picks in the SEC Championship Game win over Georgia and the BCS National Championship Game win over Notre Dame. In '13, he played in 11 games (nine starts at free safety) and totaled 51-4-2 with 3.5 tackles for loss. Received a suspension for accepting a short-term loan of less than $500 from an assistant coach, missing two games. Injured his knee against Auburn on Nov. 30, necessitating surgery on the meniscus tear, but returned to the field for the Allstate Sugar Bowl.
--NAME--s a narrow build and lacks ideal bulk. Could stand to get stronger. Not an elite athlete -- ordinary speed and leaping ability. Occasionally gets stuck on blocks. Could stand to iron out his pedal. Does not always play with abandon -- plays conservatively at times and can be late fitting in the run game or getting off the hash. Average ball production and playmaking ability. Not as natural in the box.  Was not an exceptional ballhawk or an intimidating eraser.
Good size and wingspan. Quick to read and react. Enough speed and fluidity to keep pace with slot receivers or tight ends. Ranges off the hash. Good hands to intercept. Takes direct angles to the ball. Drops downhill urgently, runs the alley and does not shy from contact -- wipes out ball carriers. Secure tackler. Can break down and tackle in space. --NAME--s special-teams experience. Well-coached in a pro-style defense.
Round 1
Hype exceeded his performance in Tuscaloosa, but --NAME-- offers starter-caliber instincts, range, coverage skills and tackling ability as a free safety. Should be a Day 1 starter.
-------------------------
Kelvin_Benjamin 2543471 28
Highly recruited out of Florida prep power Glades Central, where he also played basketball. Played through a partially torn right knee ligament as a junior in 2009. Redshirted in '11. Played all 14 games in '12 and had 30 catches for 495 yards (16.5-yard average) and four touchdowns. Started all 14 games for the national champions in '13 when he led the ACC in touchdown receptions (including the game winner in the BCS Championship Game) by hauling in 54-1,011-15 (18.7).
Lacks elite, top-end speed and many catches are contested. Hand use could improve releasing vs. tight, press coverage. Overly grabby. Is not yet a nuanced route runner and does not sink his hips and pop in and out of his breaks. Does not shake many defenders after the catch. Will make the easy concentration drop and focus could stand to improve at the break point (three drops vs. Florida). Seeks to run before securing the ball and double-catches more than he should. Blocking effort/sustainability has room to improve on the move. Has a 32 1/2-inch vertical jump and recorded the slowest 60-yard shuttle time (12.10 seconds) of any receiver at the combine.
Possesses rare size with an 83-inch wingspan. Is a physical mismatch vs. defensive backs and linebackers. Eats cushion and separates with long strides. Strong approach to the ball -- is not easily knocked off course and will enter the middle on crossers. Outstanding jumpball catcher -- climbs the ladder, plucks the ball at its highest point and regularly snatches it out of the air with superb body control and the grace of a ballerina. Creates separation with his body. Adjusts surprisingly well for the low ball and tracks it well over his shoulder. Energetic football demeanor. Confident and competitive. Strong-handed. Uses his body well to shield the defender from the ball and can beat double coverage. Good run strength after the catch (see three tackles broken on TD run vs. Florida) and does not go down easy. Strong enough to handle defensive ends when motioned inside to chip and delivered some head-snapping, crackback blocks (see N.C. State). Emerged as a clutch, go-to, big-play receiver -- caught the game-winning TD in the national championship game vs. Auburn and consistently was targeted in critical situations and in the red zone. Scorched Florida CB Loucheiz Purifoy and created mismatch problems from the slot.
Round 1
A tight end-sized, intimidating, big-play receiver with a rare wingspan, --NAME-- has the overall strength, length and wide catching radius that will demand extra coverage be rolled his way. Showed continual improvement, is still growing into the position, and possesses the traits to become a legitimate Number 1 receiver. A very intriguing mismatch weapon with ascending talent.
-------------------------
Louis_Nix 2543472 83
Highly recruited out of Florida, where he also played basketball. Redshirted in 2010. Moved into the starting nose tackle role in '11, recording 45 tackles, 4.5 tackles for loss and one-half sack with one pass batted in 13 games (11 starts). Had a breakout campaign in '12, playing in 13 games (11 starts) and registering 50-7.5-2 with five passes batted and one forced fumble. Led all Irish defensive linemen in tackles. In '13, he started the first seven games -- but then played only once over the final six weeks due to a left knee injury. Tallied 27-2-0 with two passes batted. Underwent surgery in late November to repair a torn meniscus (Dr. James Andrews). Did not bench press at the NFL Scouting Combine (pectoral).
Can play with better leverage against double teams. Does not dominate single blocking. Needs to improve hand use -- punch impact, counter moves and shed timing. Limited pass-rush value (minimal sack production). Can do a better job protecting his legs -- is not as strong on his pegs as you'd expect and spends too much time on the ground. Conditioning and stamina will have to be monitored -- takes plays off and weight has fluctuated.
Outstanding size. Commands a double team and has two-gap ability. Good quickness off the snap. Has press strength and power to push blockers into the backfield. Shows disruptive ability when his battery is charged. Flashes an arm-over. Redirects well for a big man. Nice pursuit effort. Strong wrap tackler. Scheme versatile.
Rounds 1-2 (top 50)
Despite standing to benefit from a more dominant senior season in South Bend, --NAME--, who already graduated, opted to forgo his final year of eligibility in order to provide for 13 siblings. He does not enter the NFL with momentum, having coped with knee tendinitis before season-ending surgery to repair a torn left meniscus, and too often his gregarious personality and media hype overshadowed his performance. However, if the massive interior defender taps into his power more consistently, --NAME-- has ample mass, strength and athleticism to anchor a "30" front as a space-eating, block-occupying run stuffer.
-------------------------
Justin_Gilbert 2543473 8
Played quarterback and defensive back as a Texas prep, also competing in basketball and track. Burst on the scene as a true freshman in 2010, returning 26 kickoffs for 698 yards (26.8-yard average) and two touchdowns and returning eight punts for 55 yards (6.9) in 12 games. As a reserve defensive back and special teams player, he had 18 tackles, one pass breakup and zero interceptions with one forced fumble. Missed one game with an undisclosed injury. Started 13 games at cornerback in 2011 and had 59 tackles, 10 pass breakups and five interceptions with one tackle for loss. He also returned 26 kickoffs for 703 yards (27.0) and two TDs with a pair of scores. Had interceptions against a trio of quarterbacks who became top 10 draft picks: Stanford's Andrew Luck, Baylor's Robert Griffin III and Texas A&M's Ryan Tannehill. In 13 starts in 2012, he had 63 tackles, nine pass breakups and no interceptions with 2.5 tackles for loss and one forced fumble. He also returned 32 kickoffs for 827 yards (25.8) and a TD, with a 96-yard scoring romp against West Virginia. Was a Jim Thorpe Award finalist in 2013 after registering 42 tackles, seven pass breakups and seven interceptions in 13 games (10 starts); also had 18 kickoff returns for 453 yards (25.2) and a TD. Had interception returns for touchdowns of 31 yards at Iowa State and 43 yards at Texas. Did not start against Kansas State, sitting out the first half after being ejected the week before against West Virginia. Did not start and was limited against Baylor with an injured left shoulder. Concluded his college career with eight non-offensive touchdowns, including six on kickoff returns (one shy of the NCAA record).
Is a bit soft-tempered -- not as aggressive or physical in run support as you would expect for his size. Can do a better job shedding blockers. Too often lets teammates arrive first at the scene. Spent time in the doghouse as a young player. Has some growing up to do -- maintains a lockdown corner's ego, at times coasts on his natural talent and is not immune to mental errors.
Outstanding size-speed ratio and athletic ability. Fluid movement skills -- makes it look easy flipping his hips and reacting to the thrown ball. Very good transitional quickness and recovery speed. Superb feet and agility to pop out of his breaks and close on the ball -- explosively quick. Natural interceptor with very good hand-eye coordination, leaping ability and overall ball skills. Very good vision and traffic burst as a returner (six career kickoff-return TDs).
Round 1 (top 15)
The most talented cover corner in this year's draft class, --NAME-- has size, speed and flexibility to blanket receivers at the next level. Also brings impact ability as a kick returner. Is capable of stepping into the starting lineup from Day 1 and playing at a high level if he adheres to a professional approach to the craft. Could stand to improve in run support.
-------------------------
Darqueze_Dennard 2543474 24
His name is pronounced "DAR-kwez duh-NARD." His cousin, Alfonzo --NAME--, is a cornerback with the Patriots. Two-way standout as a Georgia prep. As a senior in 2009, he caught 11 touchdown passes, returned two of his nine interceptions for scores and ran back two punts for touchdowns. Also lettered in basketball and track. Saw action in six games (two starts at boundary corner) as a true freshman in 2010, recording 11 tackles, zero pass breakups and zero interceptions with two tackles for loss, one sack and one forced fumble. Did not see action in two early season games (coach's decision) and missed the final five games with a knee injury. Made 11 starts at boundary corner in '11 and totaled 42-3-3 with one tackle for loss. Tied a Spartans bowl-game record with two interceptions in an Outback Bowl victory over Georgia, including a 38-yard touchdown return. Missed three games with an ankle injury. Started 13 games at field corner in '12, tallying 52-7-3 with 3.5 tackles for loss. After the season, he underwent double hernia surgery and was limited in spring drills. Was the Jim Thorpe Award winner as the nation's best defensive back in '13, starting 14 times at boundary corner and recording 62-10-4 with 3.5 tackles for loss and two forced fumbles. Became the first Spartans cornerback to earn unanimous first-team All-America honors and also was selected as the Big Ten's Defensive Back of the Year. Team captain. Did not do drills at the NFL Scouting Combine because of a left hamstring injury.
Has been slowed by injuries and durability needs to be examined closely (double hernia surgery). Showed some hip stiffness in combine drills. Was not asked to play a lot of zone coverage. Could stand to get functionally stronger and work to disengage from blocks. Could show more consistent willingness to support the run and set a hard edge. Selective physicality.
Looks the part -- well-proportioned, muscular physique with strong calves and thin ankles. Good press strength. Controlled, efficient pedal. Field-fast with competitive play speed. Transitions cleanly in man-off coverage. Has very good eyes and anticipation and reacts quickly to what he sees. Good pattern recognition -- sorts out what he sees quickly. Stays in the hip pocket downfield. Swift speed turn. Likeable personality. Accountable with leadership traits.
Round 1
Solidly built, athletic, instinctive, press-man cover man who took his game to another level as a senior. Brings intensity, confidence and competitiveness to the corner. Offers size to lock horns with bigger receivers, and has a ceiling as a Number 2 cover man.
-------------------------
Marqise_Lee 2543475 39
Highly recruited Parade All-American who starred as an all-purpose football player, basketball player and track competitor as a California prep. Also competed as a sprinter and long jumper for the USC track team. Made an immediate impact as a true freshman in 2011, when he was named Pac-12 Freshman Offensive Co-Player of the Year; started 8 of 12 games and produced 73 receptions for 1,143 yards (15.7-yard average) and 11 touchdowns with 10 kickoff returns for 285 yards (28.5), including an 88-yard score against Washington. Teaming with Robert Woods (2013 second-round pick by Buffalo) for the second year, totaled 118 catches for 1,721 yards (14.6) and 14 TDs in 13 starts, garnering the Biletnikoff Award, Paul Warfield Award and Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year. Was the Trojans' leading receiver for the second year in a row in 2013, when he managed 57 catches for 791 yards (13.9) and four TDs; 10 kickoff returns for 164 yards (16.4) and eight punt returns for 46 yards (5.8). Did not play against Arizona, Utah and Colorado because of knee and shin injuries. Also had 24 career rushes for 146 yards (5.5) and no touchdowns. Owns or shares 24 USC records and three conference records. Team captain.
Average size and run strength. Does not break many tackles. Was slowed by nagging injuries, and body is not built to withstand a lot of punishment. Can do a better job securing the ball through traffic -- has shown a tendency to flag the ball. Long-term durability could become an issue.
Very good athletic ability. Is a nifty runner after the catch -- can navigate through traffic and create with the ball in his hands. Can shift into top gear and run by tacklers -- terrific acceleration and short-area burst. Fine route runner -- understands how to set up defensive backs and has an innate feel for coverage. Understands how to manipulate man and zone coverage and can create separation when he needs to uncover. Very good hand-eye coordination. Tracks the deep ball very well -- has a knack for running underneath it. Attacks the ball and plucks it out of the sky. Very good competitive, functional playing speed. Has game-breaking return ability -- exceptional vision and traffic burst.
Round 1
An extremely motivated, dynamic, playmaking receiver, --NAME--'s junior season was plagued by shoulder, knee and leg injuries and a revolving door at head coach, where he cycled through three. Showed all the traits desired in a Number 1 receiver early in his career and has overcome a lot of adversity in his life to get to this point.
-------------------------
Blake_Bortles 2543477 3
Operated a wing-T offense in high school. The Florida prep redshirted in 2010. Saw action in 10 games in '11 and completed 75-of-110 (68.2 percent) passes for 958 yards, six touchdowns and three interceptions. In '12, made all 14 starts and threw for 251-399-3,059-25-7 (62.9). Was MVP of the Beef 'O' Brady Bowl after throwing for three scores and rushing for another. Earned American Athletic Conference Offensive Player of the Year in '13 after tossing 259-382-3,581-25-9 (67.8) in 13 starts. Threw for 301 yards (three TDs) and rushed for 93 yards (one score) to earn Tostitos Fiesta Bowl MVP honors. One of only two UCF quarterbacks to pass for more than 3,000 yards in multiple seasons (Daunte Culpepper). Had 195 career rushing attempts for 561 yards (2.9-yard average) and 15 touchdowns. Was 22-5 in 27 career starts in head coach George O'Leary's pro-style offense, which featured option elements.
Winds to uncork it deep and generate slightly above-average arm strength. Operated in an offense where he made a lot of one-look reads and short lateral tosses. Does not spin spirals consistently -- too many throws come out with loose wobble and could struggle to cut the wind and handle the elements of cold-winter climates. Tends to throw off his back foot when pressured, negating his accuracy. Works heavily out of the gun -- will have to adapt to snaps under center and deep drops. Operates an offense predicated on the short passing game that inflates his completion percentage. Ball handling/security could stand to improve (fumbled nine times as a junior). Struggled to throw receivers open vs. better competition (see Ohio State in 2012 and South Carolina in '13) and will require time to adjust to the closing speed of NFL defensive backs. Footwork could use some polishing -- deteriorates under duress and does not look natural on deep drops. Is only a two-year starter, can improve his overall understanding of the game and become more consistent with his mechanics.
Possesses prototype size and outstanding stature in the pocket to brush off the rush and keep plays alive. Stands tall and delivers the ball in the face of heavy pressure. Keeps his eyes downfield while climbing the pocket, can avoid the first wave and make plays with his feet (deceptively quick and plays faster than timed speed). Good field vision and release point. Is efficient throwing on the run and excels on bootlegs and play-action passing. Good zip and accuracy on short-to-intermediate throws -- can fit the ball into tight windows. Fine touch to drop the ball in the bucket -- delivers a catchable ball with good anticipation. Senses pressure and evades the rush. Doesn't take many unnecessary sacks. Can extend plays when the pocket folds. Carries a sense of calm in critical situations. Engineered comeback victories, beat Penn State and Louisville on the road and took a mid-major program to a BCS bowl. Recorded a 32 1/2-inch vertical jump, 9-foot-7 broad jump (third-best among QBs) and displayed fine touch, timing, accuracy and anticipation in combine passing drills. Ripped the ball a solid 56 mph.
Round 1
Possesses ideal size, athletic ability, intangibles and enough arm strength to develop into an upper-echelon quarterback. Is not yet a franchise quarterback, but has all the physical ingredients to become an outstanding NFL starter and his arrow is very clearly ascending. Warrants top-10 consideration.
-------------------------
Ra'Shede_Hageman 2543478 37
Has a son. Name is pronounced "ruh-SHEED HAYG-men." Grew up in foster homes before being adopted at the age of 7 by a Minnesota couple. Highly recruited tight end who also won a basketball state championship. Stayed home to play for the Gophers in 2009, where he redshirted and was switched to the defensive line. Appeared in eight games as a reserve in '10 and managed five tackles, zero tackles for loss and zero sacks. Suspended for the last four games of the season for academic issues. Logged 13-3.5-2 with one forced fumble in 13 games as a reserve in '11. Arrested in May '12 while trying to break up a bar fight and charged with disorderly conduct. The charges were later dropped. Became a starter at defensive tackle in the fall and recorded 35-7.5-6 with two batted passes and one forced fumble in 12 starts. Named the team MVP in '13 after leading the team with 13 tackles for loss with 38-13-2 with eight batted passes, his first career interception and a pair of blocked kicks -- field goal vs. UNLV and an extra point against Western Illinois in 13 starts. Team captain.
Wide gap between physical ability and performance on tape. Green eyes, instincts and understanding of blocking schemes. Motor idles. Too often lets his pads rise and exposes his frame. Does not play to his length. On skates vs. double teams. Hand use needs work. Unsophisticated counters and pass-rush moves. Aimless pass rusher in need of a plan. Minimal, inflated sack production. Still learning to convert speed to power. Does not dominate single blocking. Needs more glass in his diet. Could require simple assignments. Motivation and coachability should be examined more closely. Will be 24-year-old rookie. Has a glaring bust factor.
Long and well-proportioned. Intriguing height-weight-speed ratio and natural athleticism. Flashes the ability explode off the ball, jolt blockers and disrupt the backfield. Terrific movement, flexibility and range. Loose ankles. Can work the edges. Able to redirect and chase athletically. Fierce tackler. Workout all-star with rare leaping ability for his size (35 1/2-inch vertical) -- bench-pressed 225 pounds 32 times at the combine. Disrupts passing lanes. Has a "wow" factor at his best. Has immense upside.
Top 50
A raw, converted tight end with a basketball background, --NAME-- is a big, athletic, finesse three-technique with intriguing dimensions and movement skills who fits best in an aggressive, one-gap scheme where he could fire into gaps. Will probably be restricted to nickel pass-rush duty initially until the game slows down for him, but has impact potential if he ever figures it out. Is still maturing, having endured a harrowing childhood to get to where he is today, and would be best served landing in a structured environment with veteran mentorship. Classic boom-or-bust prospect.
-------------------------
Zack_Martin 2543480 16
Won a pair of state championships at Indianapolis Bishop Chatard. Redshirted in 2009. Started all 13 games in '10, including 11 at left tackle and two at right tackle. Started all 39 games at LT 2011-13. Two-time captain's 52 career games are the most in school history. Did not run the 40 at the NFL Scouting Combine (tight hamstring).
Lacks ideal length to stay outside in the pros -- relatively small wingspan. Not a pure road grader who rolls off flat-backed and buries defenders. Could be stressed by bigger, more powerful defensive tackles. Can improve balance and sustain on the second level. Does not have experience at guard. Could stand to bulk up in preparation for a move inside.
Engages quickly. Flexible and light on his feet. Can work his hips and maneuver. Good blocking posture -- bends his knees, sits in his stance and can shuffle, slide and mirror. Good hand placement (can pop and recoil). Seals running lanes. Can combo block and fit on linebackers. Athletic to pull and trap. Passes off stunts and is alert to blitzers. Started every game of his career. Played well against Alabama in the BCS Championship and was MVP of the Pinstripe Bowl. Sparkling intangibles. Highly respected, hardworking leader who does all the right things.
Round 1
Athletic, smart, competitive, dependable college left tackle whose length dictates a move inside, where he has plug-and-play ability in a zone-blocking scheme. One of the cleanest prospects in this year's draft.
-------------------------
Jace_Amaro 2543481 49
Also played basketball as a Texas prep. Was a reserve as a true freshman in 2011, when he caught seven balls for 57 yards (8.1-yard average) and two touchdowns in 12 games. Was arrested in March 2012 on charges of credit-card fraud, though charges were later dropped. In the fall, started six of seven games played -- three at tight end, one at "H," one at "Y," one at "Z" -- and managed 25 catches for 409 yards (16.4) and four TDs. Missed the last six regular-season games after taking a hit against West Virginia, which caused a lacerated spleen, fractured rib and internal bleeding. Was ejected from Meineke Car Care Bowl against Minnesota for throwing a punch. Set an FBS record for receiving yards by a tight end in 2013, though he was used primarily as an inside receiver. Started 10 of 13 games and piled up 106 catches for 1,352 yards (12.8) and seven TDs.
Was used as a slot receiver and does not show the functional strength and body power to match up with NFL defensive linemen. Is unsudden (average acceleration) and lacks elite top-end speed. Upright, unrefined route runner -- shows hip and ankle stiffness in and out of breaks. Struggles to consistently separate. Fairly straight-linish after the catch, as confirmed by an average three-cone time (7.42 seconds) at the combine. Ordinary run strength. Production was inflated by scheme and poor pass defenses. Labored to catch the ball at the combine and really struggled to consistently haul it in.
Excellent size with a well-proportioned frame and room for added bulk. Releases cleanly into routes. Moves like an oversized receiver. Good balance. Enough foot speed to stretch the seam. Good hands to extend and catch. Gives effort as a move blocker and can block out defensive backs. Flashes nastiness. Historic one-year production.
Rounds 2-3
Very productive, finesse, detached tight end who racked up exceptional production as a junior when he was essentially deployed as an inside receiver for the Red Raiders. Will be best utilized in a similar role in the pros.
-------------------------
Cyrus_Kouandjio 2543482 44
Last name is pronounced "KWON-joe." Parade All-American and elite recruit out of Maryland's DeMatha Catholic. Was a reserve as a true freshman in 2011 when he appeared in eight games before suffering a season-ending torn left ACL and MCL against Tennessee. Started all 26 games at left tackle 2012-13, and was slowed by injuries as a junior.
Has heavy legs and lacks ideal foot quickness for blind-side protection. Footwork and hand use have to be coached up -- looks clumsy at times. Carries his hands low. Struggles to subdue counters and gets beat across his face -- limited lateral quickness and needs to strengthen power step and inside punch. Average contact balance -- too often bends at the waist and slides off blocks. Inconsistent clearing his feet through traffic and spends too much time on the ground. Labors to cut off fast-flowing linebackers and sustain on the second level. Could stand to develop more of a mean streak. Tied for the slowest 40 time (5.63 seconds) of any participant at the combine.
Excellent body mass with extremely long arms. Uses his length to push rushers wide -- day trip to run the arc on. Has the ability to drop anchor and stymie the bull rush. Can latch onto, control and maul his man. Can hook and seal or widen the hole in the running game. Flashes the ability to bury defenders. Will be a 21-year-old rookie and has clear potential -- is physically gifted with raw, moldable tools.
Rounds 1-2 (top 50)
Massive, long-limbed, inconsistent, overhyped college left tackle whose sheer dimensions, raw tools and high ceiling are far more appealing than his snap-to-snap performance at this stage of his development. Has enough length and anchor strength to survive on the left side, though he will never be a dancing bear, and he projects more ideally as a bulldozing right tackle in a power scheme.
-------------------------
Stephon_Tuitt 2543483 46
His name is pronounced "stuh-FON TOO-it." Highly recruited out of Georgia. As a true freshman in 2011, played nine games (three starts) and collected 30 tackles, three tackles for loss and two sacks with one pass batted. All non-starts were coach's decisions. Moved into a starting defensive end role in '12, tallying 47-13-12 with one pass batted, three forced fumbles and one blocked kick in 13 starts. Returned a fumble 77 yards for a touchdown against Navy. Required offseason surgery to repair a hernia. In '13, he started all 13 games and had 49-9-7.5 with two passes batted, one interception and one forced fumble. Picked off an errant pass in the end zone for a touchdown against Michigan. Pulled out of NFL Scouting Combine drills after a medical scan revealed a Jones fracture in his left foot, necessitating surgery performed March 1 that restricted him from working out at his pro day.
Monotone edge rusher -- not a quick-twitch athlete (average get-off quickness). Can play with more consistent leverage. Hip and shoulder stiffness shows when he attempts to bend the corner. Can do a better job shooting his hands with authority to jolt blockers. Needs to become a better hands fighter and develop pass-rush moves. Can play with more violence. Average intensity and relentlessness.
Looks the part -- has prototypical dimensions for a five-technique. Long-armed to play off blocks. Holds his ground at the point of attack. Can stack and shed. Has excellent movement skill for a man his size. Plays on his feet. Coordinated and in control of his body. Knee bender able to flatten or redirect efficiently. Strong wrap tackler. Scheme and position versatile -- played end and tackle in even and odd fronts. Notched 20.5 sacks in 28 career starts. Disrupts passing lanes. Did 31 bench-press reps at the combine.
Round 1
Hulking, long-armed, physically gifted defensive lineman with desirable size, strength, athleticism and versatility to appeal as a five-technique or as a defensive tackle or base end in a 4-3. Gained approximately 20 pounds as a junior and was not in peak condition, but has disruptive upside.
-------------------------
Kony_Ealy 2543484 60
His name is pronounced "COE-nee EE-lee." Was an all-state player in both football and basketball as a Missouri prep. Weighed 207 pounds when he arrived at Mizzou in 2010, redshirting as a freshman. Played in all 13 games in '11, including a start at defensive end at Baylor, and had 16 tackles, three tackles for loss and one sack. Moved into the starting lineup at defensive end in '12, seeing action in 12 games (10 starts) and recording 37-10-3.5 with seven passes batted and one forced fumble. Was a first-team all-SEC selection in '13, starting all 14 games and totaling 43-14.5-9.5 with six passes batted, one interception and three forced fumbles. Scored his first college touchdown on a 49-yard interception return against Indiana.
Needs more time in the weight room. Still developing positional instincts and awareness to blocking schemes. Pad level is too high. Exposes his frame and gets locked up. Does not convert speed to power. Unrefined hand use, counters and pass-rush moves. Needs to learn to use his length advantageously. Does not provide enough resistance at the point of attack. Crumbles vs. double teams.
Is long and has a big, projectable frame with room for added bulk. Quick off the snap. Loose athlete. Moves like a linebacker -- 6.83-second 3-cone drill paced defensive linemen at the combine. Plays on his feet. Runs the arc -- dips his shoulder, bends the corner and gets home. Closes fast on the quarterback. Can spin off blocks, redirect and chase the quarterback. Crashes down the line and ranges in pursuit. Flexible and coordinated to zone-drop. Has upside.
Rounds 2-3
Big, athletic, ascending, pass-rush talent with the size, burst and flexibility to pressurize the edge as a right defensive end. Is not a finished product, particularly as a run defender, but should only become more disruptive as his strength, technique and savvy catch up with his natural physical ability. Could also draw looks as a 3-4 rush linebacker.
-------------------------
Aaron_Donald 2543485 13
Native Pennsylvanian. Played all 13 games as a true freshman in 2010, recording 11 tackles, three tackles for loss and two sacks with two passes batted in a reserve role. Saw action in 13 games in '11, playing every down lineman position in the 3-4 scheme, and registered 47-16-11 with four passes batted and one forced fumble. Finished second in the Big East in sacks and tackles for losses despite not starting until the final five weeks of the campaign (defensive end). In '12, he had 64-18.5-5.5 with two passes batted and one forced fumble in 12 starts. Led the conference in tackles for losses. Missed the Gardner-Webb game after his right knee was scoped. Was honored with numerous awards during his All-America campaign at defensive tackle in '13, tallying 59-28.5-11 with three passes batted, four forced fumbles and one blocked extra point in 13 starts. Team captain was the first Pitt defensive player to earn unanimous All-America honors since Hugh Green in 1980. Also was the recipient of the Bronko Nagurski Award, the Outland Trophy and the Rotary Lombardi Award. Was the NCAA leader in tackles for loss.
Marginal height and frame is nearly maxed out. Hands are more active than strong -- could play with more pop and power. Overpowered in the run game and ground up by double teams. Gets snared and controlled by bigger, longer blockers. Not a two-gap player. Has some tweener traits -- lacks ideal length and bend to play outside.
Quick off the snap. Plays with natural leverage. Gets under pads and into gaps and is highly disruptive penetrating. Explosive in short area -- recorded a 1.64-second 10-yard split at the combine. Good foot athlete -- redirects well and can work the edges and loop and stunt. Flexible enough to zone-drop in short area. Plays with awareness and consistently locates the ball. Closes hard and fast. Keeps working to the ball. Disruptive penetrating ability. Outstanding career production. Tough and competitive with terrific personal and football character. Ran the fastest 40-yard dash by a defensive tackle and the combine and bench-pressed 225 pounds 35 times. Was unblockable in Senior Bowl 1-on-1 drills.
Round 1
Short, scrappy, instinctive, highly productive defensive penetrator who does not look the part, but inspires confidence he can be an exception to the rule. Is the type you root for and has the first-step quickness, athleticism and motor to emerge as a havoc-wreaking three-technique in a fast-flowing 4-3 scheme such as the one deployed in Dallas, Chicago and Tampa Bay. Compares very favorably to (Tampa Bay 1999 15th overall pick) Booger McFarland and is a key building block and classic scheme fit for Tampa 2 teams.
-------------------------
Ryan_Shazier 2543486 15
Prepped in Florida. Originally committed to play for Urban Meyer at Florida, but Meyer resigned. --NAME-- then signed to play for Jim Tressel at Ohio State, but Tressel resigned five months later. Wound up playing for Luke Fickell for a season, then reunited with Meyer his final two seasons in Columbus. Played all 13 games in 2011, starting the final two at weakside linebacker, and recorded 57 tackles, five for loss and three sacks with two forced tackles and a blocked kick. Started all 12 games played at WLB in '12, registering 115-17-5 with 11 pass breakups, an interception touchdown and three forced fumbles. Was a Butkus Award finalist in '13 after he led the Big Ten in tackles and tackles for loss -- started all 13 games at WLB and racked up 134-22.5-6 with four pass breakups and four forced fumbles. Team captain joined James Laurinaitis, A.J. Hawk, Chris Spielman and Pepper Johnson as Buckeye linebackers to lead the team in tackles two consecutive seasons. Did not run or work out at the NFL Scouting Combine (left hamstring).
Lacks ideal size and bulk. Still developing eyes and instincts -- will diagnose and trigger more quickly down the road. Gets caught in traffic or engulfed by larger blockers when he hesitates to step downhill. Prone to overaggressiveness -- occasionally overruns plays or loses cutback contain. Could stand to improve his eyes, awareness, anticipation and reactions as a zone defender. Took some time to acclimate before making an impact.
Highly productive, disruptive playmaker vs. the run and pass. Shoots gaps and plays behind the line of scrimmage (compiled 39.5 TFL the last two seasons). Agile to slip blocks. Quick, strong hands to shed. Knifes gaps and flows very well laterally. Striking tackler -- uncoils on contact. Excellent speed and range -- opens up his stride in space and really covers ground. Bends naturally. Changes direction and accelerates with ease. Explosive first step as a pass rusher -- shows the ability to dip, bend and run the arc low to the ground. Ample athleticism and flexibility to mark backs and tight ends. Led all players at the combine with a 42-inch vertical jump and blazed a sub-4.4 40 time at his pro day. Four-down utility. Arrow is pointing up.
Round 1
The Big Ten's leading tackler, --NAME-- flies around the field and his unique athletic ability stands out. Offers a tremendous combination of speed, tackling and coverage skills to become a playmaker as a run-and-hit 4-3 Will or perhaps a 3-4 weakside 'backer if protected by a block-occupying nose tackle. Value is increased by the fact that he will not have to come off the field.
-------------------------
Dominique_Easley 2543487 29
Has a son (born in Nov. 2012). Highly recruited out of New York. Enrolled at Florida in 2010 and played in five games as a true freshman, recording four tackles, zero for loss and zero sacks. Was limited all year by an ankle injury. Earned a starting defensive tackle spot in '11 and played in 12 games, recording 37-7.5-1.5 sacks. In October, he was allegedly involved in an altercation with former Alabama football player Reggie Myles. After an investigation, the University of Florida Police Department recommended he be charged with misdemeanor battery, but the State Attorney's Office declined to press charges. In the regular-season finale against Florida State, he tore the ACL in his left knee and missed playing in the Gator Bowl. Returned to the field in '12 and started 11 games at defensive end, recording 26-8.5-4 with one pass batted. Missed two games with a sprained meniscus. Started the first three games of '13 at defensive tackle and had 5-2-0. His season was cut short when he ruptured his right ACL and medial meniscus in a non-contact practice drill. Team captain.
Lacks ideal length and bulk. Could stand to get functionally stronger. Has short arms and can be neutralized by larger linemen. Cannot be counted on to two-gap. Average production. Can be overaggressive and lose sight of the ball. Durability is a concern -- both knees have required ACL surgery.
Has natural leverage to give blockers fits. Explodes off the snap -- thrusts into gaps and wins with suddenness. Plays on his feet. Quick, active paws -- shoots his hands and locks out. Disruptive penetrating ability. Relentless and energetic. Excellent pursuit effort -- doesn't quit on plays and chases outside the box and downfield. Has played inside and outside. Works hard in the weight room.
Rounds 3-4
Undersized, explosive, athletic, high-motor three-technique whose junior season was cut short in Week 3 by a knee injury. Injury history will likely affect his draft stock, but when healthy, he shows the ability to disrupt the backfield and pressure the quarterback. Fits best in an aggressive scheme in which he could use his quickness to slant, stunt and shoot gaps. Medical evaluations will determine draft standing.
-------------------------
Jarvis_Landry 2543488 63
Cousin of 49ers defensive tackle Glenn Dorsey, who starred at LSU (2004-07). Highly sought after recruit out of Louisiana. Suffered a stress fracture in his foot in the summer of 2011. As a true freshman in the fall, saw limited action in 14 games (one start) and scratched four receptions for 43 yards (10.8) and zero touchdowns. Added 11 tackles on special teams. Played all 13 games in '12 (one start), producing 56-573-5 (10.2) with nine special-teams tackles. Was the Tigers' leading receiver in '13 -- started 10-of-13 games and racked up 77-1,193-10 (15.5). Was bothered by a foot injury in October. Strained his right hamstring running the 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine and ran only one route in drills. Team captain.
Has a fairly lean frame -- could stand to bulk up and get stronger in order to combat the jam. Lacks elite explosiveness and top-end speed -- does not have an extra gear to take the top off. Average line release, acceleration and suddenness. Could struggle to separate vs. quick-twitch cornerbacks. Large percentage of catches are contested. Lacks ideal height and is not a great leaper. Started just 12 career games.
Good balance and body control. Savvy route runner -- uses stems and nods and works back to throws. Confident hands-catcher -- snatches throws off his frame. Extends and high points. Attacks throws and wins "50-50" balls. Makes some spectacular, acrobatic grabs. Good concentration and toughness over the middle. Does not go down without a fight after the catch. Willing blocker. Lined up outside and inside. Likes to compete and it shows. Has special-teams experience covering kicks. Team captain.
Rounds 2-3
Polished, quarterback-friendly, sure-handed possession receiver with a flare for the highlight-reel catch. Could be an effective Number 3 option, capable of lining up as a "Z" or slot, working short-to-intermediate and beating zone coverage.
-------------------------
Morgan_Moses 2543489 66
Virginia native and Parade All-American. Was a non-qualifier out of high school and attended Fork Union (Va.) Military Academy in 2009. Played 11 games in '10, starting six of the final seven at right tackle. Sprained his left ankle during '11 fall camp, but started all 13 games at RT. Started 11-of-12 games at left tackle in '12 -- did not start against Wake Forest (undisclosed injury) and sprained his ankle against North Carolina. Started all 12 games at LT in '13. Did not lift at the NFL Scouting Combine because of a left shoulder injury (medical exlusion).
Plays too tall and needs to drop anchor more consistently. Heavy on his feet and tends to bend at the waist. Lethargic shifting his weight -- stressed by speed and quickness and cannot recover when beaten. Limited hip snap and is not sudden or explosive. Does not breathe fire -- plays smaller than his size in the run game and does not seek to bury defenders. Weight has fluctuated and conditioning needs to be monitored closely. Recorded the slowest 10-yard split (2.08 seconds) of any participant at the combine and tied for the lowest vertical jump (21 1/2 inches) among all offensive linemen.
Has outstanding size and vines for arms -- sheer mass and length makes it difficult for rushers to run the arc on him. Has strength to anchor. Wins with his hands. Pulls with a head of steam and can eliminate defenders when he has a bead. Logged 43 career starts.
Rounds 2-3
Big, long-armed leaner with sheer size and length and enough movement skill to function at an adequate level on the right side, though his high-maintenance conditioning, intermittent intensity and uneven performance turns off some teams. Developmental project.
-------------------------
Demarcus_Lawrence 2543490 34
Played defensive end, tight end and offensive tackle as a South Carolina prep. Attended Butler Community College (Kan.), where he redshirted in 2010 and racked up 66 tackles, 27 for loss and 10 sacks in '11. Committed to Boise State and then-head coach Chris Petersen over offers from South Carolina, Oklahoma, Clemson and Tennessee, among others. Started all 11 games played at defensive end in '12, recording 48-13.5-9.5 with an interception, four forced fumbles, a blocked kick and a fumble return touchdown.

Was suspended against Tennessee-Martin.
Could stand to get stronger and play with more pop and power in his hands. Lacks ideal bulk to play with his hand in the dirt. Gets knocked around when he exposes his frame. Doesn't control tight ends. Is weak at the point of attack and gets wiped out by double teams. Can be overaggressive and lose contain or fly by tackles. Can do a better job protecting his legs. Lacks experience playing in reverse. Character and stability need to be looked into.
Highly athletic. Fluid, flexible and rangy. Terrific balance and body control. Has quick, coordinated hands and feet to slingshot off blocks. Has natural pass-rush ability -- shows burst, bend and closing speed to hunt down quarterbacks. Dips inside suddenly. Terrific knee and ankle flexion -- flattens efficiently and redirects and accelerates smoothly. Explosive tackler. Made an instant impact at BSU and was productive behind the line of scrimmage -- 34 TFL and 20 sacks from 2012-13. Carries a swagger and plays with attitude.
Rounds 1-2 (top 50)
A loose, explosive, long-limbed athlete, --NAME-- consistently pressurizes the edge and harasses quarterbacks. His pass-rushing ability rates among the best in this year's class, and he holds mass appeal. Lacks ideal stoutness at the point of attack, but could thrive as a 4-3 right end or 3-4 rush linebacker, and should contribute readily on passing downs.
-------------------------
Paul_Richardson 2543491 45
Father, --NAME-- Sr., played at UCLA and had a cup of coffee in the NFL. Cousin, Shaquille --NAME--, played cornerback at Arizona (2010-13). --NAME-- Jr. starred in football, basketball and track as a California prep. Originally signed with UCLA in 2010, but was dismissed by then-head coach Rick Neuheisel after he was arrested, along with Shaquille and another incoming freshman, for theft -- allegedly stole a female student's backpack from a storage locker. Moved on to Colorado, where he played all 12 games in the fall, starting four, and recorded 34 receptions for 514 yards (15.1-yard average) and six touchdowns. In '11, caught 39-555-5 (14.2) in nine starts -- missed four October contests and was hampered the rest of the season because of a torn left MCL. Missed the '12 season after tearing his left ACL in April. Returned to start all 12 games in '13, leading CU receivers with 83-1,343-10 (16.2). Was bothered by a right ankle sprain (sustained against Arizona) in November. Team captain.
Is very lean. Needs to bulk up and get stronger. Has been injured and durability could be an issue. Vulnerable to the jam. Does not separate consistently -- needs to become a more refined, deceptive route runner. Average burst out of breaks. Lets some throws into his body and drops throws he shouldn't. Gets out-muscled at the catch point for 50-50 balls. Limited run strength. Underpowered blocker.
Jab steps and accelerates into routes. Fluid and field fast. Chews up ground with long strides. Stretches the field vertically and can run under deep throws. Can drive off corners, break off and work back to the quarterback. Can extend to pluck off his frame. Shows he's capable of making the spectacular grab. Productive despite a poor supporting cast. Has a 38-inch vertical jump.
Rounds 3-4
Very lean, narrow-framed, finesse "X" receiver who made an immediate impact at Colorado before knee injuries derailed his progress. Measurables will go a long way in determining his ultimate draft value, and his success at the next level is dependent upon his ability to make plays in the vertical passing game. Has a boom-or-bust element. Size and durability are question marks.
-------------------------
Lamarcus_Joyner 2543492 41
Elite defensive back recruit out of Florida prep powerhouse St. Thomas Aquinas, where he played cornerback and piled up 1,090 all-purpose yards on just 79 touches en route to being named USA Today's National Defensive Player of the Year. Arrived at Florida State in 2010 and played in all 14 games as a true freshman, recording 23 tackles, three pass breakups and one interception. Returned 16 kickoffs for 329 yards (20.6-yard average).

Was a Jim Thorpe Award finalist in '13, starting six times at cornerback and eight times in a nickel position for the national champions -- posted 69-4-2 with seven tackles for loss, 5.5 sacks and three forced fumbles. Also went 5-110-0 (22.0) returning kickoffs. His sack total ranked first among NCAA defensive backs. Did not miss a game in his four years at Florida State, concluding his time there with 41 consecutive starts.
Average athlete. Tight-hipped and rounds off breaks -- not sudden. Lacks foot speed to carry receivers vertically from the slot and is seldom placed in situations where he can be distressed in downfield coverage. Lacks size and stature for press coverage. Can be out-quicked by shifty slot receivers. Marginal recovery speed and catch-up burst when he gets caught peeking. Struggles to match up with size and speed in man coverage. Makes mental mistakes too much in banjo coverage and struggles to sort out bunch sets. Does not have a body ideally built to withstand a 16-game season.
Instinctive and anticipatory. Advanced understanding from the back end -- makes subtle, pre-snap adjustments and diagnoses plays.  Steps downhill quickly. Outstanding overall production in all facets. Good competitive playing speed -- runs as fast as he needs to. Very good football-playing demeanor -- confident and opportunistic. Showed up in big games and made clutch plays (see Clemson). Times up the blitz very well and plays bigger than his size. Has contributed as a gunner and displayed good short-area burst in the return game. Exceptional work ethic and leadership traits. Respected, vocal team leader with an infectious attitude that can unite a locker room. Has been extremely durable, especially given his size and playing style.
Rounds 4-5
A terrific college football player and galvanizing leader for a national champion, --NAME-- is a tweener lacking unique physical traits for the pro game, and his dimensions leave him vulnerable to mismatches. However, he possesses special intangibles which could enable him to make his mark on special teams and compete for a sub-package role as a short-hole plugger where he can make plays on the ball in front of him.ole plugger where he can make plays on the ball in front of him.teams and in the return game to carve a role. Has a make-it attitude and winning mentality that could allow him to overcome his physical limitations. Compares favorably to Panthers 2009 seventh-rounder Captain Munnerlyn.
-------------------------
Jason_Verrett 2543493 25
Last name is pronounced "VER-rett." Played defensive back and running back as a California prep. Attended Santa Rosa (Calif.) JC, where he grayshirted in 2009 while learning to play defensive back. Returned to the field for the '10 season, playing in seven games and missing three contests with a hamstring injury and was ranked the sixth-best junior college DB. Transferred to TCU in '11 and played in all 13 games (10 starts), logging 58 tackles, four pass breakups and one interception with 1.5 tackles for loss. Had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee during '12 spring practice. Led the Big 12 in interceptions in the fall after posting 63-16-6 with five tackles for loss and a blocked field goal in 13 starts. Suffered a torn meniscus in his right knee against Texas but played in final two games before having surgery in January '13. Named co-Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year after logging 39-14-2 with 3.5 tackles for loss, one sack and one forced fumble in 11 starts. Played most of the season with a torn labrum originally injured in the third game against Texas Tech and re-injured in November. Had the shoulder surgically repaired in March.
Does not look the part -- is short and short-armed with a small, thin-waisted, thin-boned body. Durability is an issue -- struggles to stay healthy and is not built to endure the physical toll of the NFL, particularly as a starter. Low-dive tackler (misses some). Can be overwhelmed by bigger blockers and struggles to shed blocks. Average play strength. Had a bout with lost confidence as a younger player when he nearly quit after being embarrassed by Robert Griffin III and a high-powered Baylor offense.
Quick, twitchy and explosive popping out of his pedal. Good eyes, anticipation and footwork. Very feisty and athletic. Outstanding instincts. Superb reactive quickness and recovery speed. Very good ball skills -- consistently makes plays on the ball. Very willing in run support and plays bigger than his size. Athleticism was on display at the combine -- 40-yard dash (4.38 seconds), 3-cone drill (6.69), short shuttle (4.00) vertical jump (39 inches) and broad jump (10 feet, 8 inches) ranked among the best of the cornerbacks.
Round 2
A tough, scrappy, undersized nickel back with potential to ascend to a Number 2 CB if he can stay in one piece. Is not the physical prototype for the position, but compensates with outstanding athleticism, blazing speed and a tenacious temperament. Is a terrific football player who boasts toughness and competitiveness reminiscent of Cortland Finnegan's.
-------------------------
Dee_Ford 2543494 23
Prepped in Alabama. Played all 13 games as a true freshman in 2009 and was credited with 12 tackles, 2.5 tackles for loss and a sack with one interception. Played all 13 games in 2010 (one start at right end) and had 11 tackles, two tackles for loss and two sacks. In 2011, he had seven tackles, two tackles for loss and a sack in three games before having season-ending microdisectomy surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back. Was granted a medical hardship, preserving a year of eligibility. Started 7 of 11 games played at defensive end in 2012, totaling 34 tackles, 6.5 tackles for loss and six sacks with a batted pass, forced fumble and blocked kick. Suffered an abdominal injury against Arkansas; did not play against Ole Miss and was hampered against Vanderbilt, Texas A&M and New Mexico State. Hurt his left MCL during 2013 fall camp. Missed the first two games (Washington State, Arkansas State) and did not start against Mississippi State, but started the final 11 games and collected 29 tackles, 14.5 tackles for loss and 10.5 sacks with a batted pass and two forced fumbles. Was not medically cleared to work out at the combine after a medical exam revealed a problem stemming from previous back surgery (medical exclusion).
Undersized -- thin-framed, lacks bulk and anchor strength to dig in vs. the run. Cannot convert speed to power and gets stalled if he cannot work half of a blocker. Struggles to discard blockers when locked up and gets inverted. Not comfortable moving in reverse. Has consistently been dinged with injuries and has never made it through a full season healthy. Recorded a very pedestrian 4.73-second 20-yard shuttle time at his pro day, indicative of marginal change of direction.
Very good acceleration and burst to beat blockers off the ball. Anticipates the snap very well and has a long second step. Plays with urgency and keeps working to the quarterback. Outstanding energy and work ethic. Athletic enough to fall in coverage and play on his feet. Beat Texas A&M RT Cedric Ogbuehi for two sacks to close out a 45-41 upset victory in 2013 and finished the season strong. Respected, defensive tempo-setter. Distinguished by his effort, hustle and pursuit.
Top 50
High-motor college left defensive end perhaps suited for a rush linebacker role in the pros. Has added more than 50 pounds to his frame since arriving on campus and has demonstrated the desire, work habits and competitiveness to develop into a productive edge rusher if he can stay healthy and is programmed to go get the quarterback only.
-------------------------
Davante_Adams 2543495 53
Also starred in basketball as a California prep. Redshirted in 2011, earning offensive scout team player of the year recognition. Was Mountain West Conference Freshman of the Year in '12 when he amassed 102 receptions for 1,312 yards (12.9-yard average) and 14 touchdowns in 13 starts, setting conference freshman records for catches and yards. Led the nation in receptions and receiving touchdowns and set a single-season school record for receiving yards in '13 when he started 12-of-13 contests and piled up 131-1,718-24 (13.1). Owns MWC records for single-season and career touchdown catches (38) as well as the school mark for career receptions (233).
Lacks ideal functional playing strength to consistently beat the jam and can get hung up at the line. Long strider and is not sudden out of his breaks. Production was inflated from a quick-hitting, lateral passing game.
Has a rangy build with good body length and secure hands to palm the ball and make difficult one-handed grabs. Tracks and adjusts to the ball very well downfield. Extends outside his frame and plucks the ball out of the air. Natural hands-catcher. Terrific athlete with good leaping ability and anticipation to properly time jumps and highpoint the ball. Wins jumpballs in the red zone and shows very good hand-eye coordination to take the ball away from defenders. Exceptional production. Has a 39 1/2-inch vertical jump.
Round 2
A rangy, sure-handed possession receiver with starter-caliber, positional traits. Lacks top-end speed and strength. As a 21-year-old, third-year sophomore entering the draft early, is still growing into his body and developing core strength. Comparing favorably to a poor man's Michael Crabtree, --NAME-- possesses very intriguing upside to be groomed.
-------------------------
Odell_Beckham 2543496 12
Father, --NAME-- Sr., was a running back for the Tigers (1989-92) and mother, Heather Van Norman, was an LSU All-American and national champion in track (1991-93). --NAME-- Jr. was an all-purpose standout as a Louisiana prep. As a true freshman in 2011 (wore jersey Number 33), played all 14 games (11 starts at "Z" receiver) and recorded 41 receptions for 475 yards (11.6-yard average) and two touchdowns. Started 12-of-13 games at the "Z" in '12 (team opened with extra tight end against Arkansas), tallying 43-713-2 (16.6). Was the Paul Hornung Award winner as the nation's most versatile player in '13 when he broke the LSU single-season all-purpose yards record (2,315) and snagged 59-1,152-8 (19.5) in 13 starts at "X" receiver. Also returned 68 career punts for 557 yards (8.2), including two scores, and 42 kickoffs for 1,044 yards (24.9).
Adequate height. Lacks elite top-end speed to separate vertically. Could stand to polish the finer points of his route running. Inconsistent making contested grabs -- can be out-muscled in a crowd. Has some concentration drops. Can improve as a blocker. Was not an impactful punt returner. Was held in check by Florida and Alabama.
Quick hands and feet to slip the jam. Fluid and fast. Good balance. Sinks his hips and changes gears to create separation. Quick hands to pluck off his frame. Terrific leaping ability -- climbs the ladder to snatch throws. Creates after the catch -- shows burst and shiftiness as a runner. Has playmaking ability. Confident and competitive. Has kickoff- and punt-return experience. Productive three-year starter.
Round 1
Talented, competitive, productive, inconsistent college split end who projects as a big-play receiver in the pros. Offers versatility to toggle between "X," "Z" and slot given his ability to stretch the field and run after the catch. Brings added value as a kick returner.

Given name is Raymond. His younger brother, Corey, is a tight end for the Crimson Tide. The Alabama prep threw for 66 touchdowns and nine interceptions as a three-year starter. Redshirted in 2009. Saw action in all 13 games in '10, including eight as a reserve quarterback, and completed 30-of-48 passes for 389 yards (62.5 percent) with three touchdowns and zero interceptions.

The 30 TD passes set the school record and he accomplished the feat while playing through shoulder and knee injuries. Had a standout senior campaign in '13, winning the Maxwell Award (college football player of the year), the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award and finishing second in the Heisman Trophy voting. Set the Alabama record for passing yards after tossing 226-336-3,063-28-7 (67.3) in 13 starts. Had a 36-4 record in 40 career starts with all four losses coming to opponents ranked in the top 15. Team captain.
Surrounded by an NFL-caliber supporting cast with a very good offensive line that provides a lot of time to dissect the field. Does not have a big-time, vertical arm. Average athlete. Makes occasional bone-headed decisions. Heaves the deep ball and forces receivers to make adjustments. Does not drive the deep out.
Well-versed operating a pro-style offense and makes NFL-style progression reads. Is comfortable working from under center and in the gun. Mobile enough to sidestep the first wave. Good field vision, timing and anticipation. Very good short-to-intermediate accuracy (evidenced by a 66.9 percent career completion rate). Throws with accuracy on the move -- good wrist snap. Delivers the ball under duress. Has enough arm strength to fit the ball into spots. Consistent throwing mechanics -- has a smooth stroke. Good caretaker and decision-maker. Mature leader. Smart and articulate. Highly competitive team leader -- holds teammates accountable. Very well-prepared. Directed back-to-back national championship offenses.
Round 2
An efficient game-managing quarterback who has shown he can carry an offense at times throughout his career, but more often is dependent on a terrific supporting cast. Grades out most highly for his intangibles and decision-making, knowing when and where to go with the ball, and could earn an NFL starting job.

Competed in the Junior Olympics as a sprinter and also played basketball as a California prep. Played all 38 games of his career. Started three games at flanker as an injury replacement for James Rodgers in 2011, with 31 receptions for 391 yards (12.6-yard average) and three touchdowns.

Returned 12 punts for 72 yards (6.0). Also had 61 career rushes for 340 yards (5.6) and two touchdowns. Owns Oregon State record for career touchdown catches (24). Team captain.
Size is just adequate -- is small-framed and lacks ideal length and bulk. Vulnerable to the jam and reroute. Relatively small catch radius. Has small hands and double-catches some throws. Lacks elite, blazing speed to run by NFL corners and safeties. Will struggle to play "above the rim" at the next level. Was not an impactful punt returner. Limited run strength. Poor blocker.
Light on his feet with terrific balance. Sinks his hips with ease and pops out of breaks to separate. Tracks and adjusts. Quick hands. Good concentration, body control and boundary awareness. Can turn a short throw into a long gain. Shows elusiveness, creativity and vision after the catch. Unafraid to play in the tall trees.

Rounds 1-2 (top 50)
Short, speedy, nifty-footed receiver who was unaffected by the departure of Steelers 2013 third-rounder Markus Wheaton, establishing himself as a playmaker in his own right by leading the nation with 133 yards per contest as a junior. Projects as a useful slot receiver with run-after-catch ability and some utility as an outside receiver.
-------------------------
Derek_Carr 2543499 36
Married with a child. His brother, quarterback David --NAME--, was the Number 1 overall pick by the Houston Texans in 2002. Finished his prep career in California after spending two years in Texas. Joined Fresno State in the spring of 2009 and saw limited action in five contests in the fall, completing 10 of 14 passes for 112 yards with zero touchdowns and zero interceptions. Redshirted in '10. Led the WAC in passing yards after tossing 279-446-3,544-26-9 (62.6) in 13 starts in '11. Threw for 344-511-4,104-37-7 (67.3) in '12 while making all 13 starts. Was named Mountain West Offensive Player of the Year for a second straight season in '13 after a monster year, throwing 453-659-5,082-50-8 (68.7) in 13 starts. Became the fourth QB in FBS history to throw for more than 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns and the first QB in Fresno State history with more than 3,000 yards three times. Three-time team captain with a 24-15 career record in 39 games as a starter.
Lacks ideal height and has relatively small hands. Bulk is just adequate. Could stand to improve as a deep passer. At times tries to do too much and forces some throws. Occasionally throws off balance unnecessarily and sails some throws. Operated out of the shotgun and pistol and made a lot short/lateral throws and half-field reads. Production is inflated by spread offense and porous Mountain West Conference defenses -- nine 2013 opponents (excluding an FCS opponent) ranked between 81st and 125th nationally in scoring defense and/or passing defense. Had his worst game in the Las Vegas Bowl against USC.
Athletic with very good feet -- can roll the pocket, evade the rush or escape when pocket crumbles. Terrific arm talent -- releases from the ear and can make all the throws. Quick-armed with wrist snap. Can alter his platform and throw on the move or off his back foot. Throws come out on time and accurately. Drills short-to-intermediate throws and flashes touch. Likes to play and it shows. Sells out to make a play. Record-breaking production. Adapted to coaching/system change and receiver turnover. Improved ball security -- fumbled only once as a senior compared to 12 times the previous two seasons. Desirable intangibles for the position -- advanced maturity, leadership and intelligence. Shows poise and moxie. On-field general who commands the huddle. Passionate about the game and works at his craft.
Round 1
Athletic, tough, instinctive, strong-armed, highly competitive quarterback who will impress in workouts, interviews and on the board, and improved his draft standing with those skills in the postseason. Elevated the Fresno State program and profiles like a gunslinger, though he'd be better served in the long run honing his game-management skills. Will be a starter sooner rather than later and the degree to which he's able to make those around him better will determine his ceiling.
-------------------------
Jordan_Matthews 2543500 42
Cousin of Hall of Famer Jerry Rice. Receiver-defensive back who also played basketball as an Alabama prep. Played all 52 games of his career. As a true freshman in 2010, started 10-of-12 games and caught 15 balls for 181 yards (12.1-yard average) and four touchdowns. Started all 13 games and paced Commodore receivers each of the next three seasons -- produced 41-778-5 (19.0) in '11; 94-1,323-8 (14.1) in '12; and 112-1,477-7 (13.2) in '13. Rewrote the VU receiving records and owns SEC records for career receptions (262) and receiving yards (3,759). Team captain.
Could stand to bulk up his frame. Adequate line release. Fairly linear. Not a quick-twitch athlete. Does not show elite explosion to separate vertically. Lets some throws into his body and is not immune to concentration drops. Limited creativity and elusiveness after the catch. Can be moody and has some diva in him.
Good length. Big zone target. Good form as a route runner. Sinks his hips and pops out of breaks. Concentrates, tracks and adjusts. Soft hands and sticky fingers. Has leaping ability to compete in the air. Opens up his stride in the clear and shows nice long speed. Good field awareness. Gives effort as a blocker. Competes and plays with intensity.

-------------------------
Aaron_Colvin 2543501 114
His last name is pronounced "COLE-vin." Oklahoma native. Arrived on campus in 2010 and played in 14 games (one start at cornerback) as a true freshman, totaling 34-3-0 with three tackles for loss and one forced fumble. Was moved to strong safety in '11 and had 84-6-0 with 4.5 tackles for loss and one-half sack in 12 total starts (including one at cornerback). Missed one game because of a concussion. Following the season, he underwent shoulder surgery and was not on the field during spring drills. Returned to cornerback for the '12 season and registered 61-11-4 with 2.5 tackles for loss and two sacks in 13 starts. Despite missing time in '13 with turf toe and shoulder injuries, he recorded 55-3-1 with five tackles for loss and one sack in 11 games (10 starts). Returned a blocked extra point 98 yards for two points against Kansas. Missed two games to concussion recovery. In January '14, he tore his right ACL during Senior Bowl practice, necessitating surgery (Dr. James Andrews), and was medically excluded from the NFL Scouting Combine.
Average bend, feet and twitch, which negates his transitional quickness and allows receivers to create separation out of breaks. Does not play fast. Lacks striking power. Gets hung up on blocks. Has a concussion history.
Looks the part -- good size, body length and athletic ability. Fine technician. Smart and instinctive -- can sort out combo routes. Matches up well with taller receivers and can carry them vertically downfield. Functional tackler. Hardworking, respected team leader who will hold teammates accountable. Experienced, three-year starter.
Rounds 5-6
Long, smart, tough, zone corner whose body is not built to withstand heavy contact or the aggression with which he likes to play. Will grow on evaluators the more they watch him and has the instincts to eventually compete for a starting job, though teams could always be looking to upgrade his lack of speed and athletic ability. Torn ACL injury suffered at the Senior Bowl will affect his readiness for the season and could drop his draft status by a round or two.
-------------------------
Tre_Mason 2543502 75
His father, Vincent "DJ Maseo" --NAME--, is a member of the Grammy Award-winning hip hop group De La Soul. Was a top Florida prep running back, rushing for 1,643 yards and 24 touchdowns as a senior in 2010. Played in 12 games as a true freshman for Auburn in '11, rushing 28 times for 166 yards (5.9-yard average) and one touchdown while returning 24 kickoffs for 633 yards (26.4) and one touchdown. Led the SEC in kickoff return average. Won the kickoff return job in camp and scored on a 97-yard scamper in his collegiate debut. After seeing limited action down the stretch, including losing his job as the kick returner, he was forced into a prominent role in the Chick-fil-A Bowl after starter Michael Dyer was suspended -- --NAME-- responded with a 9-64-1 performance against Virginia. Did not play in one game (coach's decision). Had a much larger role in '12, splitting time at running back and rushing 171-1,002-8 (5.9) and catching 7-86-0 (12.3) in 12 games (five starts). Was the first non-QB to lead Auburn in total offense since Bo Jackson in 1985. Had a breakout campaign in '13, piling up 317-1,816-23 (5.7) on the ground, 12-163-1 (13.6) receiving and 15-395-1 (26.3) returning kickoffs in 14 games (12 starts). Was a Heisman Trophy finalist, breaking Bo Jackson's single-season school mark with his SEC-high rushing yardage total. Also set school single-season records for all-purpose yards (2,374) and rushing touchdowns in winning SEC Offensive Player of the Year honors. Over Auburn's final three games against Alabama, Missouri and Florida State, he racked up 663 yards on the ground -- including a memorable 46-304-4 affair against Mizzou in the SEC Championship Game. Followed up that performance with 195 rushing yards vs. Florida State, the most ever for a running back in a BCS Championship Game.
Lacks ideal size and could stand to bulk up to withstand a pounding. At times dances more than he should instead of taking what the defense gives. Seldom used as a receiver out of the backfield and could sharpen his route running. Can take better care of the football -- eight fumbles the last two seasons. Durability could be an issue given his running style. Played in an up-tempo, power-spread system and benefited from light boxes, fatigued defenses and a strong offensive line.
Low center of gravity and pad level. Quick out of the blocks. Good vision to pick and slide. Can jump-cut abruptly and change the angle of pursuit. Darts through holes -- excellent stop-and-start quickness. Spins off contact. Forward lean. Runs bigger than his size and finishes runs. Flashes good hands and creativity as a short receiver in limited exposure. Trustworthy in pass protection -- faces up rushers. Has kickoff-return experience and has shown he can take it the distance. Proved capable of handling a heavy workload and played big in big games against top competition. Has a 38 1/2-inch vertical jump.
Round 2

Also was used with his hand in the dirt in nickel. Team captain.
Very average weight-room strength. Underdeveloped upper body. Can be folded and neutralized by down blocks against more physical blockers (see Notre Dame). Cannot square up and play honest vs. top power. Has coverage limitations -- is tight and late to transition. More natural moving forward than in reverse. Coverage limitations show up vs. backs. Can be stressed vs. speed in the open field.
Naturally big-boned with a good frame to add bulk if desired. Very good instincts. Above-average athlete -- bends fairly well. Massive mitts (11 1/8 inches) measured bigger than any other player at the combine. Good hand use -- can jolt blockers with his punch. Controls the line of scrimmage and consistently outleverages tight ends. Very physical re-routing tight ends at the line. Outstanding motor and sack production -- led the country in sacks (15) as a senior. Tough, smart and hardworking with a throwback personality. Leader vocally and by example. Will hold teammates accountable and represent the program with class.
Rounds 2-3
As a base end in an even front or a LOLB in an odd front, --NAME--'s instincts, motor and toughness are what define his success and could allow him to eventually become a double-digit sack producer in the pros. Will require a few years to adapt to the speed of the NFL game.
-------------------------
DaQuan_Jones 2543504 112
His first name is pronounced "DAY-qwan." Was a highly recruited offensive lineman as a New York prep. Also lettered in basketball and track. Enrolled at Penn State in 2010 and initially was going to redshirt as a freshman, as he was held out of the Nittany Lions' first four games.

Had a strong senior year in '13 after dropping 15 pounds in the offseason, starting 12 times and recording 56-11.5-3. Team captain.
Takes some plays off and occasionally loafs on plays away from him. Could stand to develop counters and pass-rush moves. Does not threaten the edges. Does not accelerate off blocks and closing burst is just average. Can do a better job protecting his legs. Weight and conditioning have fluctuated.
Big body -- looks the part. Fires off the snap and engages quickly. Is difficult to displace and has a strong upper body. Able to control blocks and locate the ball. Plays with a load in his hands -- presses blockers, extends and discards. Generates a strong bull rush and collapses the pocket. Is athletic and redirects well for a big man. Flashes disruptive ability and dominates at times, creating production for teammates. Scheme versatile. Has upside.
Rounds 3-4
Big, strong-bodied interior force who shed weight and improved his stamina as a senior, displaying NFL-caliber physicality in the trenches. Has been inconsistent in the past, but if the light has come on, --NAME--' combination of size, power and movement enables him to play as a 4-3 one-technique or 3-4 five-technique.
-------------------------
Bradley_Roby 2543505 31
Played receiver and defensive back as a Georgia prep. Redshirted in 2010 before starting all 13 games at cornerback in '11, recording 47 tackles, six pass breakups and tied for the team lead with three interceptions with 3.5 tackles for loss.

Scored touchdowns on a blocked punt against Northwestern and a 63-yard interception return vs. Illinois. Did not play in the Orange Bowl against Clemson with a bone bruise in his knee.
Inconsistent performance as a junior. Can be boxed out by tall receivers and outmuscled for "50-50" balls. Could stand to improve jam strength in order to hem/re-route receivers bigger receivers. Gets wired to blocks. Durability could be an issue given his physical playing style. Could stand to iron out his pedal. Gets caught peeking ' lets receivers behind him and is vulnerable to double moves. Misses some 1-on-1 tackles in space. Character should be looked into.
Good size. Has thin ankles and large hands. Quick-twitch athlete with prototypical speed. Can mirror off the line and shadow slot receivers. Has 38 1/2-inch vertical. Terrific balance. Loose-hipped, quick-footed and agile (4.04-second three-cone drill). Smooth transition and change of direction. Flips his hips and has ample speed to carry receivers downfield. Plants and drives in a blink. Quick-handed to play the pocket. Excellent ball production. Shows recovery speed. Physical and aggressive. Feisty, willing tackler -- does not hesitate to sacrifice his body. Displays good zone awareness and has experience in off-man. Dangerous as a blitzer and kick-block rusher. Worked as a gunner.
Round 1
Urgent, confident, competitive athlete with an intriguing combination of speed, suddenness, ball skills and tackling ability. Has broad appeal given his scheme versatility, and should be able to contribute readily as nickel slot defender and special-teams contributor. Has a ceiling as a Number 2.
-------------------------
Travis_Swanson 2543506 76
Prepped in Texas. Redshirted in 2009. Started all 50 games at center 2010-13. First two-time captain in Razorback history.
Needs to bulk up his frame and get stronger. Limited push, power and explosion -- too often content to stalemate. Does not play with a load in his hands. Tends to bend at the waist, lean and fall off blocks. Spends too much time on the ground. Struggles to sustain on the second level. Center only. Produced the fewest reps (20) of 225 pounds of any lineman at the combine.
Functional base in pass protection. Can work his hips and seal and execute combo blocks. Aware and alert -- good in-line reactions. Durable and battle-tested -- started all 50 games of his career and has experience locking horns with NFL-caliber defensive tackles. Highly respected two-time captain. Intelligent vocal leader with outstanding football character.
Rounds 3-4
Experienced, dependable pivot who lacks starter-caliber power and athleticism. Lack of versatility hurts his chances, and he will have to survive on smarts, leadership and competitiveness.
-------------------------
Allen_Robinson 2543509 61

Non-start was season opener against Syracuse when PSU opened with three tight ends. First player since at least 1985 to lead the Big Ten in receptions and receiving yardage in consecutive seasons.
Lacks elite top-end speed -- needs double moves to separate vertically and gets tracked down from behind. Occasionally tracking and leap timing are off. Is more confident in his hands outside the numbers or in the air than he is over the middle. Traps throws against his body and double-catches some. Tends to cradle throws or go down to the ground. Swings the ball loosely as a runner. Can improve physicality and sustain as a blocker.
Excellent size. Good line release -- defeats press. Sinks his hips, breaks off sharply and creates separation. Works back to the ball. Climbs the ladder ' has elevation and body control to contort and make plays in the air. Turns short throws into chunk plays -- gets upfield quickly and shows shiftiness, vision and run strength.

Rounds 2-3
The Big Ten's leading receiver the last two seasons, --NAME-- is a big, fluid, outside receiver with a nice combination of "above-the-rim" prowess and run-after-catch ability. Offers possession skills, playmaking ability and red-zone utility to develop into a solid Number 2 option.
-------------------------
Jeoffrey_Pagan 2543547 177
The North Carolina prep overcame a severe knee injury, missing a portion of his senior season with two torn ligaments in his right knee, which required surgery. Played in six games as a true freshman for Alabama in 2011 and recorded four tackles. Was a valuable reserve defensive lineman in '12, appearing in all 14 games for the national champions.

Missed a mid-season contest against Georgia State because of a sprained shoulder.
Thick, tight hips -- cannot work the edges. Gets blown off the ball by double teams. Needs to play with better extension, refine his hand use, develop counters and quicken his shed timing. Heavy-legged when required to redirect. Limited pass-rush value. Only a one-year starter. Average production -- did not make splash plays.
Good size. Can occupy blocks and squeeze running lanes. Strong hands to press and tug free. Can push the pocket. Heavy tackler. Played multiple techniques in a pro-style, hybrid defensive scheme.
Rounds 3-4
Thickly built, relatively nondescript contributor who decided to forgo his senior season despite never establishing himself as a force. Has size and strength to warrant developmental consideration as a five-technique, but lacks exceptional traits and will have to commit to handling the dirty work to have longevity.

Was medically excluded from the NFL Scouting Combine (knee).
Short arms. Lacks elite top-end speed. Not a quick-twitch athlete. Does not explode off the hash and closing burst is just average -- late getting over the top.

Dull pop on contact -- not an explosive, blow-up tackler. Started just 15 games.
Good size and big hands. Reads and reacts quickly. Assignment-sound and well-coached. Drops downhill to support the run and has experience in deep-zone coverage. Dependable wrap tackler. Good production. Vocal leader who commanded the secondary and made all the calls. Stood out on special teams as a younger player and has the makeup to be a special-teams captain in the pros.
Rounds 6-7
A coach's son, --NAME-- has requisite athletic ability for the pro game, but his head for the game rates among his best traits. Has the size, tackling ability and dependability to make a living as a backup and core special-teams player. Draft stock could be impacted by 2013 season-ending torn ACL.

Was a consensus All-America selection for the second straight year and concluded his Arizona career as the school's all-time leader in rushing yards (4,239), rushing touchdowns (48) and all-purpose yards (5,483).
Lacks ideal size and has a narrow, high-cut build with a lean lower body. Upright running style exposes his body to some direct hits and durability could be an issue. Does not string moves together and does not have elite breakaway speed. Average wiggle and elusiveness (cuts off his heels). Faced light boxes in a spread, zone-read offense. Had nearly 850 touches in college and body has already endured a lot of punishment. Has been removed from some team boards for off-the-field transgressions/suspensions. Must prove committed.
Outstanding two-year production -- piled up 3,814 yards and 42 touchdowns on the ground from 2012-13, ranking among the nation's most prolific. Terrific compete level and determination -- runs with energy, doesn't go down easily and punctuates runs. Tries to punish tacklers and keeps his legs pumping -- grinds out yards after contact. Good feet, acceleration and lateral agility. Spins off contact. Reliable shot receiver. Gets upfield with urgency after the catch and has enough shiftiness to create. Willing to throw a shoulder blow into rushers. Can handle a heavy workload -- averaged 26 carries per game the last two seasons.
Rounds 3-4
Highly productive, hard-charging slasher who runs more competitively than he does powerfully and picks up yardage in chunks. Has some first-round traits and is one of the most instinctive runners in this year's draft class, though his stock could be affected by off-the-field troubles and an average combine showing.
-------------------------
Carl_Bradford 2543552 121
Played for Jaguars RB Toby Gerhart's father at Norco (Calif.) High, where he was a wingback in a double-wing offense. Was present in March '12 when his father, Roy, died of a heart attack. Recruited as a linebacker and redshirted in 2010. Saw action as a defensive end, linebacker and special-teams player in '11 -- appeared in all 13 games, drawing the start at DE against Boise State in the Las Vegas Bowl in place of the suspended Junior Onyeali, and tallied 12 tackles, 3.5 for loss and zero sacks. Started all 13 games at the "Devil" position (hybrid DE/OLB) in '12, notching 81-20.5-11.5 with four batted passes, an interception and three forced fumbles. Started all 14 games in '13, recording 61-19-8.5 with four batted passes, an 18-yard interception touchdown and three forced fumbles. Was benched in the second half of the Oregon State contest after getting into an argument with Will Sutton that escalated into words with head coach Todd Graham on the sideline.
Has a short, compact frame with very short arms and gets hung on blocks. Gets locked down by big-bodied blockers when they get their hands on him. Spins in place and lacks variety of pass-rush moves. Cannot convert speed to power. Needs to improve his hand use.
Plays with urgency and beelines to the ball. Explosive -- can power-clean 400 pounds and hits on the rise with power. Is effective stunting and looping. Flashes playmaking ability (see UCLA). Explosive tackler. Can play on his feet off the ball and times up the blitz well. Good hands. Athletic enough to fold back into coverage. Solid instincts and diagnose -- sniffs out screens and has a feel for locating the ball quickly. Excellent leaping ability -- posted a 37 1/2-inch vertical.
Rounds 3-4
An undersized college defensive end, --NAME-- projects to outside linebacker in a 3-4 front in the pros, where his physical dimensions and rush ability are best suited. Would profile best in an aggressive, one-gapping odd front such as the Colts, Jets, Ravens or Steelers.
-------------------------
Ryan_Carrethers 2543554 165
The Nashville-area prep led his school to three consecutive championship games. Also lettered in wrestling. Redshirted in 2009. Appeared in 10 games in '10 as a reserve defensive lineman and had six tackles, zero for loss and zero sacks. Played in all 13 games in '11, moving into the starting lineup for the final six games at nose guard -- had 29-3-1.5. Started all 13 games at nose tackle in '12, recording 68-3.5-1. Broke out in '13, starting 13 times at nose tackle and tallying 93-8-4 with two blocked field goals. Lined up at fullback against Western Kentucky and rumbled into the end zone for a 1-yard score. Completed his career in dramatic fashion in the GoDaddy Bowl against Ball State, blocking a 38-yard field goal attempt that could have tied the game as time expired.
Lacks ideal height. Has short arms and small hands. Average initial quickness. Heavy-legged with limited range. Inconsistent contact balance at the point of attack -- rooted out of the hole more often than he should be. Needs to improve hand use -- quickness, placement and shed timing. Marginal pass-rush value. Stamina has to be monitored. Not a workout warrior -- across the board was one of the worst combine performers, including a 7-foot, 2-inch broad jump and 8.29-second 3-cone drill, both combine worsts.
Big and thick with outstanding weight-room strength -- maintains low body fat, squats a small house and bench-pressed 225 pounds 32 times at the combine. Has sheer mass and natural girth to dig in and hold his ground vs. double teams. Has a wrestling background and understands leverage. Has two-gap ability. Heavy tackler. Nice effort for a big man. Tough and durable. Solid personal and football character -- is devoted to his craft and has a professional approach to the game.
Rounds 5-6
Stoutly built, NFL-strong interior defender who was a literal and figurative anchor for the Red Wolves despite playing for four different head coaches. Could make a living occupying blocks and clogging run lanes as a two-down, rotational nose tackle in an odd front.
-------------------------
Jonathan_Newsome 2543555 166
Prepped at Glenville High in Ohio, where he played for Ted Ginn Sr. Began his college career at Ohio State, where he played five games as a true freshman in 2009 (wore jersey Number 55) and recorded five tackles, zero for loss and zero sacks. Appeared in all 13 games in '10 (one start as an injury replacement) and was credited with 15-0-0 with a blocked kick. Did not keep up academically (sat out '11 spring practice) or climb the depth chart at OSU. Transferred and sat out '11, per NCAA rules.  Was arrested in August '12 for marijuana possession and was also held on a warrant for a conversion charge from an incident in which he and a teammate allegedly tried to shoplift male enhancement pills. Served a two-game suspension before starting all 11 games played at right defensive end and notching 52-12.5-8.5 with a batted pass. Started 11-of-12 games played in '13, tallying 64-11.5-8 with a batted pass, an interception and two forced fumbles. Did not play against Army or start against North Texas (ankle).
Strength-deficient and gets hammered in the box. Thin-legged and narrow-based. Too light to set the edge. Limited cover skills  -- is tight in the hips and not natural moving in reverse or coming out of breaks. Immature early in college career.
Very good edge burst. Has a long second step and attacks the edges with speed and leverage. Flattens down the line -- good lateral pursuit. Can get depth in coverage and spot drop. Flashes explosive striking ability as a tackler.
Rounds 5-6
A 4-3 open-side speed rusher ideally suited for an elephant end or 3-4 Jack linebacker role. Is at his best rushing the passer and has shown improved maturity since departing Ohio State before the 2011 season.
-------------------------
Demetri_Goodson 2543557 197
His brother, Mike, is a running back for the Jets. --NAME-- began his college career as a basketball player at Gonzaga, averaging 5.1 points per game in 103 contests over three seasons. In 2011, he decided to give football another try and transferred to Baylor. Saw action in four games as a defensive reserve and on special teams, recording one tackle and returning three kickoffs for 100 yards and zero touchdowns (33.3-yard average). Tore ligaments in his right ankle on a kickoff Oct. 8, missing the rest of the season. Earned a starting cornerback job in '12 and started the first three games of the season. Did not start the fourth game, but fractured his right forearm in two spots in the first quarter against West Virginia and missed the remainder of the year. Had 16 tackles, two pass breakups and one interception with two tackles for loss. Also was 2-49-0 (24.5) returning kickoffs. He was granted a medical-hardship waiver to play in '13 and saw his most extensive gridiron action, appearing in 11 games (10 starts) and tallying 26-13-3. Led the team in interceptions, including a pick against Central Florida's Blake Bortles in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. Missed the first two games of the season with a bone bruise after re-injuring his right arm in one of the final fall scrimmages.
Has been unable to stay in one piece and durability is a major concern. Has short arms and small hands. Relatively inexperienced with green instincts. Press technique needs to be coached up. Loses separation at the break point. Limited tackle production -- gets stuck on blocks and doesn't set a hard edge. Will be a 25-year-old rookie.
Excellent size. Good athletic ability, hand-eye coordination and ball production. Can turn and run vertical. Nice plant-and-drive -- breaks on throws. Has a 37-inch vertical. Has some upside. Comes from an athletic family and has NFL bloodlines.
Priority free agent
Overaged, injury-prone, height-weight-speed prospect with a basketball background. Shows in flashes when he's able to rely on his reactionary skills and natural athleticism to break up throws, but he is raw and will have to prove he offers developmental value.
-------------------------
Lache_Seastrunk 2543559 186
First name is pronounced "Lake." Ranked as a Top 5 overall prospect as a Texas prep after rushing for 4,217 yards and scoring 52 total touchdowns. Was also an accomplished track athlete, competing in the 100 meters (personal best 10.33 seconds) and the long jump (21-8). Began his career at Oregon in 2010, where he traveled but did not play and redshirted. It was later discovered that his advisor, Willie Lyles, accepted a $25,000 payment from Oregon after he signed his letter of intent. Oregon was placed on three years probation and lost some scholarships as a result of the NCAA investigation. Decided to transfer because he thought "something was about to go down" at Oregon and because of his grandparents' bad health ended up at Baylor. Had to sit out the '11 season due to NCAA transfer rules and lost a year of eligibility. Played in a game for the first time in three years in '12 and was named the Big 12 Offensive Newcomer of the Year. Carried the ball 131 times for 1,012 yards (7.7-yard average) and seven touchdowns in 13 games (six starts) after starting slowly -- had only 181 yards after seven contests but amassed 831 yards in his final six contests. Grabbed nine passes for 107 yards (11.9) and one touchdown. Led the Big 12 with 107.0 yards per game in '13 after recording 158-1,177-11 (7.4) on the ground in 11 games (eight starts). Suffered a groin injury against Oklahoma and missed the next two games (Texas Tech, Oklahoma State). Is the first player in Baylor history to top 1,000 yards rushing in multiple seasons. Five of his 19 touchdowns came on plays of longer than 68 yards.
Does not run big or keep his shoulders squared to the line. Will press and try to do too much -- can improve patience and do a better job of letting his blocks develop. Very limited career receiving production. Played in an offense that featured big running lanes and helped inflate his production. Can be tracked down from behind. Beats to the tune of his own drum and can be susceptible to hanger-ons.
Quick-footed and nifty with very good competitive speed to pull away in the open field. Deceptively fast. Keeps his feet churning on contact and can elude the first tackler and power through arm tackles. Runs low to the ground with good lower-body strength. Weaves through traffic and has a knack for hitting cutback lanes. Very good run balance to stop and start. Had the best vertical jump (41 1/2 inches) and broad jump (11-2) of any back at the combine.
Rounds 4-5
Good-sized, productive, zone runner with enough physical traits to warrant consideration as a complementary back. Benefited from an offense featuring a lot of fly sweeps and lateral runs that have not translated well to the NFL game. Overall character will require closer evaluation and can determime draft status.
-------------------------
Matthew_Paradis 2543560 207
Grew up on an Idaho farm. Played eight-man football in high school, won a state championship and was named Idaho's 1A Player of the Year award. Also won a state discus championship and played basketball. Tore his left ACL in 2007. Was lightly recruited, walked on and grayshirted in '08. Redshirted as a defensive tackle in '09, earning Scout Team Defensive Player of the Year recognition. Saw action in only one game in '10. Earned a scholarship going into '11 when he converted to center and played eight games, drawing one start as an injury replacement. Stepped into the lineup and started all 25 games at center 2012-13.
Is not big-framed and body is nearly maxed out. Could stand to improve weight-room strength. Average athlete for the position. Might be stressed by larger, more powerful wide-body nose tackles. Falls off blocks when he bends at the waist. Questionable long-term durability (hip).
Plays on his feet with good balance. Generates movement in the run game. Seeks to bury defenders. Strong 6-inch punch. Good hand placement. Firm base in pass protection. Plays with leverage to bend and slide. Alert to stunts and blitzes. Tough and competitive. Terrific intangibles, including leadership traits -- humble, hardworking and highly respected.
Round 7-Priority free agent
A converted defensive lineman and former walk-on, --NAME-- is a stoutly built, intelligent, hard-nosed overachiever who will make it difficult for coaches to cut him.
-------------------------
Kevin_Pierre-Louis 2543563 132
Was Connecticut's Gatorade Player of the Year. Also played basketball and lacrosse. Played the weak side his first three seasons. As a true freshman in 2010, started all 13 games and produced 93 tackles, 2.5 for loss and zero sacks with three pass breakups. Started all nine games played in '11 and notched 74-6-0 with four pass breakups and a forced fumble. Missed three games while nursing a high right ankle sprain. Started all nine games played in '12 and recorded 85-4-2 with three pass breakups. Missed three games after pulling his right quad. Moved to the strong side in '13 when he started all 13 games and registered 108-10.5-6 with an interception.
Needs to improve functional strength. Average eyes and diagnostic skills. Loses sight of the ball, gets sucked in by playaction and takes false steps. Gets knocked out of the hole at the point of attack. Stays wired to blocks. Has man-cover limitations. Has tweener traits -- lacks ideal bulk for linebacker and speed for safety.
Tight-skinned, muscular build. Athletic knee-bender. Flows well laterally. Protects his legs and slips blocks. Motivated and hardworking. Productive four-year starter. Combine all-star put on a show in Indianapolis -- ran in the low 4.5s, pumped 28 bench-press reps, posted a 39-inch vertical, recorded a 10-foot, 8-inch broad jump, finished the short shuttle in 4.02 seconds and ran a 6.92-second 3-cone drill.
Rounds 5-6
Small-framed, experienced, productive, finesse weakside linebacker who has bulked up 15-20 pounds in the last year. Helped himself with an outstanding combine performance, and is best-suited in a fast-flow scheme in which he can utilize his athleticism to run and hit. Has traits to be used on special teams and develop as a nickel linebacker.
-------------------------
Kaleb_Ramsey 2543564 243
Also played tight end and was an all-state basketball player as a Pennsylvania prep. Saw action in seven games as a true freshman in 2008 and posted six tackles, zero tackles for loss and one sack. Logged 11-0-2 in seven contests (two starts at right tackle and one at left) in '09. Missed five games because of leg injuries. Appeared in 11 games, starting 10 at left defensive tackle, in '10 and recorded 39-7.5-2.5 with one pass batted down. Was suspended for unspecified reasons against Notre Dame and missed the Virginia game with a hip injury. Did not participate in '11 spring practice while recovering from left shoulder surgery. In the fall, started the season opener against Northwestern but injured his left foot and sat out the season with plantar fasciitis (was granted a medical hardship, preserving eligibility). Started the first two games in '12, tallying 4-.5-0, before a left calf tear sidelined him for the season. Obtained a sixth year of eligibility in '13 -- shifted to defensive end and started 8-of-10 games played, collecting 28-4-2. Did not start against Florida State or Miami, and missed three games in November while nursing a hamstring injury. Did not perform at the NFL Scouting Combine or his pro day because of a right calf injury (medical exclusion).
Durability is a red flag -- is fragile and has missed a multitude of games the last five seasons because of head, hip, shoulder, foot, knee and calf injuries. Inconsistent pad level. Needs to improve hand violence and dexterity to disengage more quickly. Linear rusher. Could stand to play with more intensity snap to snap. Ordinary production. Will be 25-year-old rookie.
Good read-and-react skills. Shows stack strength to press and extend. Good initial quickness -- bursts off the snap and has disruptive ability. Plays on his feet, is athletic and bends well for his size. Can redirect and chase. Gives effort in pursuit. Strong tackler. Has played inside and outside. Bench-pressed 225 pounds 36 times at the combine, tops among defensive linemen.
Round 7-Priority free agent
A sixth-year senior, --NAME-- has the physical tools to serve in a rotational role as an aggressive five-technique or 4-3 left end, though his injury history and long-term durability concerns limit his value and could scare teams off.
-------------------------
Andre_Williams 2543565 113
The Pennsylvania prep rushed for 1,913 yards and 33 touchdowns as a senior. Lived in Georgia for his first two seasons of high school. Appeared in all 13 contests as a true freshman in 2010, starting the final two, and rushed 95 times for 461 yards (4.6-yard average) and two touchdowns. Led the team in rushing touchdowns in '11, posting 124-517-4 (4.2) in 10 games (seven starts). Missed two games due to injuries Clemson (ankle) and Florida State (abdominal). Did not participate in '12 spring practice after surgery to repair a torn labrum in his left shoulder. Was the team's leading rusher in the fall despite only playing in nine games (eight starts) and logging 130-584-4 (4.5). Missed the final three games with a torn abdominal muscle (left side) suffered against Wake Forest. Had a stellar senior campaign in '13, leading the nation in rushing yards (2,177), being a finalist for the Heisman Trophy and winning the Doak Walker (nation's premier running back) in addition to being a consensus All-America selection. Ran for 335-2,177-18 (6.5) in 13 starts and became the 16th player in FBS history to top the 2,000-yard mark. Rushed for more than 200 yards in a game five times, including an ACC and school record 339 yards (42 attempts) against N.C. State. Averaged 167.5 yards per game on the ground to lead all Division I players. Was not used much as a receiver in his career, catching 10 passes for 60 yards (6.0-yard average) in four years. Graduated in December.
Much of his production is blocked for him -- produced many runs of 20-plus yards untouched. Is not dynamic or creative and makes few tacklers miss. Can do a better job selling routes and settling into soft spots in zones. Minimal receiving production -- 10 career catches.
Has very long arms with good overall musculature, wide shoulders and a thick, power base. Good vision to find creases. Runs with urgency and steps downhill fast. Shows an extra gear to kick it into overdrive and outrace defenders to the end zone. Good finishing speed -- did not see him get tracked down from behind. Can power through arm tackles, brush off contact and clear his feet through traffic -- very good contact balance. Solid anchor in pass protection. Keen blitz recognition. Smart and competitive. Caught the ball extremely well at his pro day.
Rounds 2-3
Very strong, stocky, powerful runner with the instincts, contact balance and toughness to carry a heavy workload. Really emerged as a senior, when he led the nation in rushing, and proved worthy of a starting role. Limitations in the receiving game could diminish his value.
-------------------------
Khairi_Fortt 2543568 126
First name is pronounced "ky-REE." Highly recruited USA Today All-American who also played lacrosse and ran track as a Connecticut prep. Suffered a sprained right ACL and bruised tibia as a senior in 2009. Began his college career at Penn State and was a reserve/special-teams player for two seasons. Appeared in nine games in 2010 (one start as an injury replacement) and tallied 17-.5-0. Played all 13 games in '11 and was credited with 33-6-2.5. Had surgery in April '12 to repair a ligament that stabilized the patella in his right knee (dealt with subluxation since ninth grade when he tore the ligament). Following the Jerry Sandusky scandal, transferred to Cal where he was eligible to play immediately, but redshirted while recovering from his knee procedure. In '13, started the first nine games at Will linebacker and produced 64-3.5-.5 before suffering a season-ending biceps injury against Arizona. Strained his left hamstring during NFL Scouting Combine drills and did not run shuttles or the 3-cone drill.
Frame is nearly maxed out. Very average key-and-diagnose skills slow his play speed. Does not always trust what he sees -- takes false steps and hesitates to trigger. Inconsistent run fits and field leverage. Can be stronger at the point of attack. Did not make enough splash plays. Has underachiever traits. Motivation and durability should be looked into.
Good size with a muscular build. Field fast -- moves like a safety. Very athletic and agile. Plays on his feet and bends naturally. Excellent lateral agility -- flows smoothly and has sideline-to-sideline range. Uses his arms like flippers to play off blocks. Loose-hipped to drop into coverage and match with backs and tight ends. Has traits to excel on special teams. Bench-pressed 225 pounds 30 times, tied for most among linebackers at the combine.
Rounds 4-5
A better athlete than football player at this stage of his development, --NAME-- transferred from Penn State and played only one season at Cal before making a premature jump to the NFL. Speedy, finesse, see-and-go reactor who looks the part and has intriguing, starter-caliber athleticism to fit on the weak side in a fast-flowing 4-3 where he's freed up to chase the ball. Must sharpen his eyes and instincts to reach his potential.
-------------------------
Richard_Rodgers 2543569 98
Father, --NAME-- Sr., was involved in "The Play" in the 1982 Cal-Stanford game, and currently serves as the special-teams coordinator for the Carolina Panthers. --NAME-- Jr. was a receiver-defensive end who also played basketball as a Massachusetts prep. Recruited as a tight end, committed to Cal and then-head coach Jeff Tedford. Saw very limited action in 2011 (13 games). Started 6-of-11 games played in '12 and caught 20 balls for 288 yards (14.4-yard average) and a touchdown. Did not play against Ohio State (ankle) and played the final three games of the season with torn ligaments in his right foot. Had surgery to repair a torn labrum and sat out '13 spring practice. In the fall, played 11 games and pulled in 39-608-1 (15.6). Injured his left thumb against Arizona, had surgery and did not play against USC.
Tight hips. Average speed and suddenness -- dull in/out of breaks and struggles to separate vs. more explosive safeties. Unrefined route runner. Straightlinish after the catch. Started just 11 games in three seasons.
Good balance and body control. Dependable short-to-intermediate receiver. Can snatch throws off his body and make contested grabs. Has potential as a move blocker. Showed dedication and discipline re-shaping his body as a junior. Coach's son.
Rounds 5-6
--NAME--' career arc was affected by Cal's coaching turnover, as the former high school receiver was recruited as a tight end by Jeff Tedord's staff and bulked up to 275 pounds as a sophomore when he was out of shape, in part because of a torn labrum and torn foot ligament. As a junior, --NAME-- shed 30 pounds and shifted to inside receiver for Sonny Dykes, enabling him to show his more natural "F" tight end skills. Is an unpolished product, but could be a better pro than college player.
-------------------------
Storm_Johnson 2543570 222
Full name is Westleigh --NAME--. The Atlanta-area prep earned all-state honors in 2009 after rushing for 1,937 yards and 31 touchdowns. Originally committed to LSU before signing with Miami. The Hurricanes planned to redshirt him in 2010, but then-coach Randy Shannon wound up using him in 10 games as a true freshman. Rushed nine times for 119 yards (13.2-yard average) and one touchdown with nine kickoff returns for 194 yards (21.6) and zero touchdowns. Had the team's longest run of the year, a 71-yard touchdown scamper against South Florida. Did not play in three games due to coach's decisions. In April '11, he was reportedly one of several Miami players involved in an incident at a UM residential hall that resulted in police being called. He was reportedly going to be suspended by new coach Al Golden for the season opener before electing to transfer to Central Florida. After sitting out the '11 season due to transfer rules, he returned to the field in '12 and carried 113-507-4 (4.5) and caught 10-20-0 (2.0). Appeared in 13 games, starting five of UCF's first six games. Had only 21 carries the rest of the year, missing one game and not touching the ball in two others. Broke out in '13, tallying 213-1,139-14 (5.3) on the ground and 30-260-3 (8.7) receiving in 13 starts. Had five 100-yard games, including a 20-124-3 performance against Baylor in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl.
Has tight hips and struggles to string moves together. Lacks elite top-end speed -- cannot gain the edge or pull away from the pack. Gears down and chops his steps to cut. Too often tripped up by ankle tackles. Pass protection needs work. Shaky ball security -- eight fumbles in 366 carries 2012-13 (always totes in right hand). Only one year as a feature back.
Excellent size and strength to run between the tackles. Has quick feet, gets out of the blocks well and shows some giddyup for a bigger back. Nice leg drive and forward lean. Surprisingly slippery. Good open-field ability -- displays nice peripheral vision and elusiveness to run to daylight. Creates after the catch -- can turn a screen or dump-off into a long gain. Scheme-versatile.
Rounds 4-5
A Miami transfer, --NAME-- is a big, nifty-footed runner with enough run strength and burst to be productive in a downhill power scheme or as a one-cut zone runner. However, he will have to take better care of the football and make strides in pass protection to earn carries.
-------------------------
Bashaud_Breeland 2543571 102
Has an infant daughter. Played quarterback and defensive back as a South Carolina prep. Also lettered in basketball and track, winning state titles in the 400-meter hurdles as both a sophomore and junior. Redshirted in 2010. Saw his first collegiate action in '11 and played in 14 games (seven starts) at cornerback, recording 53 tackles, four pass breakups and two interceptions with one tackle for loss. Was limited during an injury-plagued '12 season, registering 32-3-0 with 2.5 tackles for loss and one sack in 10 games (five starts). Suffered an abdominal strain early in the year and eventually underwent groin surgery in December, missing the final three games of the year. Had a breakout '13 campaign, appearing in 13 games (12 starts) and totaling 74-13-4 with five tackles for loss, two sacks and two forced fumbles. Was suspended for the first half of the Maryland contest after he was ejected for targeting against Florida State.
Needs to bulk up and get functionally stronger. Gets wired on blocks. Lacks ideal speed. Average explosion and leaping ability. Plays into the boundary. Tends to play out of control and his tackling technique needs work -- misses too many. Exposed vs. Florida State's Rashad Greene.
Fluid athlete. Quick-footed and loose-hipped. Can shadow, mirror and stay in phase. Plays with a sense of urgency and is aggressive supporting the run. Gives effort to pursue from the back side.
Rounds 2-3
Lean, rangy cover corner who sticks his nose in run support and competes against bigger receivers. Is relatively raw, but has an appealing temperament and moldable tools.
-------------------------
Martavis_Bryant 2543572 118
Was a non-qualifier as a South Carolina prep and spent 2010 at Hargrave Military Academy (Va.). Joined Clemson in '11 when he played all 14 games (two starts) and tallied nine receptions for 221 yards (24.6-yard average) and two touchdowns. Appeared in 10 games in '12, managing 10-305-4 (30.1). Did not play against Boston College or Georgia Tech (groin), and was academically ineligible for the Chick-fil-A Bowl. Started 11-of-13 games in '13, totaling 42-828-7 (19.7). Did not start against Wake Forest as punishment for a throat-slash gesture, and gave way to a fullback and tight end against Maryland. Also returned 14 career kickoffs for 291 yards (20.8).
Shaky hands -- tends to double-clutch the ball and makes too many easy drops. Is not a polished route runner -- is stiff in and out of his breaks. Lacks toughness desired to work the middle of the field. Must prove that he is willing to work to assimilate a playbook and learn the finer points of the game.
Superb body length with a long, rangy frame. Very good straight-line, separation speed. Can drop his hips surprisingly well for as tall as he is and is fairly shifty after the catch. Good red-zone target -- effective making back-shoulder catches. Flashes the ability to climb the ladder and highpoint the ball. Has return experience.
Rounds 4-5
A lean, long-limbed, rangy, outside-the-numbers, big-play receiver, --NAME-- declared for the draft early with underclassmen nipping at his playing time late in the season. Will require additional seasoning to make a mark in the pro game. A better tester than football player at this stage of his development, he has tools to be molded if he learns to hone his focus.
-------------------------
Yawin_Smallwood 2543575 253
Strong safety-option quarterback who also played basketball as a Massachusetts prep. Redshirted in 2010. Started all 36 games of his career at middle linebacker, pacing UConn tacklers his final two seasons -- totaled 94 tackles, 2.5 for loss and 1.5 sacks with three pass breakups, an interception, a forced fumble and a fumble return touchdown in '11; 120-15-4 with four pass breakups and two forced fumbles in '12; and 118-9.5-4 with nine pass breakups, an interception TD and two forced fumbles in '13. Team captain. Strained his left hamstring running the 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine and did not run at his pro day while still nursing the injury, only performing positional drills.
Average eyes and instincts. Does not use his hands violently to take on and discard blocks. Shows some lower-body stiffness. Dull lateral agility. Does not play downhill and can be a step late to the perimeter. Inconsistent run fits and tackling -- too often fails to wrap and drive through ball carriers.
Good size, acceleration and straight-line speed. Plays on his feet and sidesteps blocks. Gets depth in his zone drops and keeps pace with backs in coverage. Highly productive three-year starter. Respected, coachable team captain. Very good leaping ability (36 1/2-inch vertical).
Rounds 4-5
Productive college middle linebacker at his best when he's kept clean or has a clear path. Projects best in a 4-3, where he has enough athleticism and functionality in coverage to play in the middle or on the weak side. Has starter-caliber potential, but might be the type you look to replace.
-------------------------
Ronald_Powell 2543579 169
Consensus Number 1 defensive end recruit in the nation coming out of California. Played all 13 games as a true freshman in 2010 (one start at strong-side linebacker) and tallied 26 tackles, three for loss and a sack with two pass breakups. Started 12 games at the Buck (hybrid defensive end/linebacker) in '11 and totaled 32-9-6 with a forced fumble. Suffered an upper-body injury against LSU and sat out against Auburn. Sat out the '12 season when he tore his left ACL twice. Started 8-of-11 games played in '13 -- six at the Buck, two at Sam -- and managed 26-7-4. Did not start against Tennessee, then sprained his ankle against LSU, which kept him out of the Missouri contest and kept him out of the starting lineup against Georgia and Vanderbilt. Strained his left hamstring running the 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine and did not participate in drills or run shuttles and the 3-cone drill.
Inconsistent get-off. Average eyes and instincts -- has to see it before he triggers. Shoddy edge setter. Plays short-armed, gets locked up and allows linemen to capture his outside shoulder. Aimless, unrefined pass rusher. Intensity and urgency leave something to be desired. Has coasted on natural talent. Had his tires pumped since high school -- entitlement was an issue as a young player and his personality could rub some people the wrong way. Injury history.
Looks the part -- well-proportioned, athletic, muscular build. Natural bender. Terrific agility. Can stunt and loop. Closes fast. Flashes strong hands and power potential. Loose hips to zone drop. Was deployed as a stand-up linebacker and hand-in-the-dirt rush end. Has untapped potential.
Rounds 3-4
--NAME-- is a physically gifted, inconsistent, college Buck 'backer with crude strength and athleticism. Has developmental value as a stand-up rush linebacker, but must dedicate himself to the craft and realize he's no longer the big man on campus.

Keith_Reaser 2543582 170
Was a two-sport athlete as a Miami prep, lettering in football and track. Enrolled at Florida Atlantic in 2009 and redshirted as a freshman. Played in 10 games (including three starts) at cornerback in 2010 and had 26 tackles, zero pass breakups and one interception with one tackle for loss. Started all 12 games in '11 and had 61-7-2 with 2.5 tackles for loss. Returned four kickoffs for 82 yards (20.5-yard average). In '12, he made 12 starts and registered 45-3-2 with 1.5 tackles for loss. Recovered a fumble at Western Kentucky and scooped it up for a nine-yard score. Started FAU's first six games of '13 before tearing his left ACL in an October contest against UAB. Registered 25-4-0 with two tackles for loss. Underwent four months of rehab after undergoing surgery on his left knee and was invited to the NFL Scouting Combine. After meeting with doctors in Indianapolis who were concerned about his MRI, he flew to Pensacola to see Dr. James Andrews, who explained that his body was rejecting the graft used from a cadaver in repairing his ACL. Subsequently underwent a second surgery Feb. 27 in which a graft was used from his own patellar tendon.
Average agility and long speed. Lacks strength in run support and could stand to be more aggressive filling. Tackles low. Not explosive. Nonchalant football-playing demeanor. Does not play with confidence or trigger quickly to what he sees. Average ball skills.
Has a solid build and showed strength at the combine, bench-pressing 225 pounds 22 times. Demonstrates nice balance and body control in his pedal -- turns his feet over rapidly and is comfortable in reverse. Confident in off-man coverage -- maintains good cushion and keeps receivers in front of him. Nice shadow and mirror in man coverage. Smooth-hipped. Good football intelligence. Understands run fits. Respected team leader.
Round 7-Priority free agent
Good-sized, smooth-moving, man-cover corner who showed the ability to mirror before a knee injury cut short his senior season. Mental toughness and determination will be put to the test, as he faces rehabilitation for a second surgery and an uphill battle to earn an NFL job.
-------------------------
Devonta_Freeman 2543583 103
Miami-area prep who rushed for 308 yards in the 2010 Class 6A state championship game in his only year as a starter. Rushed for 2,208 yards and 26 touchdowns as a senior before enrolling early at Florida State in January 2011. Began his freshman year fourth on the Seminoles' depth chart, but rose to the starting tailback role in the second half of the season due to injuries. Played in 12 games (seven starts) and rushed 120 times for 579 yards (4.8-yard average) and eight touchdowns with 15 receptions for 111 yards (7.4) and zero touchdowns. Recorded the fifth-most rushing yards for a true freshman in FSU history. Was hampered late in the year after aggravating a previous back injury. Began '12 as the backup tailback and took over the starting job down the stretch, appearing in 14 games (five starts) and tallying 111-660-8 (5.9) on the ground and 10-86-0 (8.6) receiving. Broke out in '13, earning All-ACC honors after becoming the first FSU player to reach the 1,000-yards mark since Warrick Dunn in 1996. Started all 14 games for the national champions, amassing 173-1,016-14 (5.9) rushing and 22-278-1 (12.6) receiving. Scored at least one touchdown in each of his last 10 games, including a three-yard score against Auburn in the BCS National Championship Game.
Lacks ideal size and power for a bellcow back and does not run heavily between the tackles. Does not possess home-run speed. Ran behind one of the most talented offensive lines in college football in an offense stacked with talent. Has been nagged by back injuries.
Well-built with a compact frame. Very good eyes and lateral agility in the hole -- shimmies through small spaces and can create yardage where there is none. Squares his shoulders to the line and runs efficiently. Good lower-body strength, surprising power and superb balance. Tough and runs hard. Catches outside his frame and can make the difficult catch. Strong and nifty after the catch. Reliable in pass protection. Terrific competitor. Extremely durable and never missed a game. Works at his craft and is a student of the game.
Rounds 2-3
Compactly built, downhill slasher with the agility and balanced skill set to emerge as a workhorse back. Earned the top assignment in a very talented backfield and has a similar build, running style and all-around utility as San Francisco 49ers 2005 third-round pick Frank Gore. Could prove to be a better pro than college player.
-------------------------
Bryan_Stork 2543584 105
Played tight end as a Florida prep. Redshirted in 2009. Appeared in 10 games in '10, starting four at right guard. Missed two games (mono). Started 10-of-12 games played in '11, including eight at center, two at left guard -- did not play against Boston College and did not start against Miami (migraines), then suffered a finger injury against Florida which became infected and nearly required amputation. Started all 13 games played at center in '12. Sat out against Savannah State (neck). Was limited during '13 fall camp while recovering from toe surgery. On the season, started all 13 games played at center for the national champs and won the Rimington Trophy as the nation's top center. Did not play against Wake Forest (ankle). Did not participate in any physical testing at the NFL Scouting Combine because of injuries to his left knee and both shoulders (medical exclusion).
Has short arms and stiff hips. Lumbering movement skill -- can be late to reach the second level. Dips his head and grabs. Tends to play tall and can be bulled into the backfield when he rises straight up.  Not explosive -- cannot sink his hips and roll off the ball in the run game to move defenders. Average functional strength. Benefited from playing alongside two very talented guards that helped cover up deficiencies.
Excellent size. Has shown he can handle big-bodied cloggers. Maintains good positioning and can slide, shuffle and seal off defenders. Solid anchor in pass protection. Uses his hands well to control defenders. Understands angles and leverage. Athletic enough to chip and work up a level. Good competitor. Has played guard and center and offers interior versatility. Good football intelligence. Lunchpail worker. The game is important to him.
Round 7-Priority free agent
Good-sized, bump-and-steer blocker ideally suited for a zone-blocking, slide-protection scheme. Smart, tough technician capable of serving as an interior swing backup and could eventually fend for a starting job as a pivot. Will be best developed by a patient, respectful position coach.
-------------------------
Aaron_Murray 2543587 163
The Florida prep was a Parade and U.S. Army All-American in addition to being named Mr. Football as a junior. Suffered a broken left fibula early in his senior season but returned to lead the team to a 4A state championship. Enrolled at Georgia in the spring of 2009 and redshirted in the fall. Named team's Most Valuable Offensive Player in '10 after completing 209-of-342 passes for 3,049 yards (61.1 percent) with 24 touchdowns and eight interceptions in 13 starts. Made all 14 starts in '11 and recorded 238-403-3,149-35-14 (59.1). Graduated in May '12. Had a record-setting fall by recording school marks for passing yards and touchdown passes with 249-386-3,893-36-10 (64.5) in 14 starts. Finished his stellar four-year career by tossing 225-347-3,075-26-9 (64.8) in 11 starts before suffering a torn ACL in his left knee against Kentucky. Is the only QB in SEC history to throw for more than 3,000 yards in all four seasons and is the conference's career record holder in touchdowns (121) and passing yards (13,166). Was a two-time Academic All-American and named the SEC Scholar Athlete of the Year. Two-time team captain. Had 16 career rushing touchdowns and went 35-17 in 52 starts. Did not perform at the NFL Scouting Combine because of knee injury.
Short and short-armed with a low release point that leads to batted balls. Very small-framed with a thin waist and a body that is not built to withstand the punishment that comes in the pocket. Average arm talent. Has to set his feet and everything needs to be perfect to function well. Could stand to improve his footwork. Marginal deep-ball accuracy -- tends to overstride and forces receivers to adjust. Many passes are pre-determined and often throws to spots. Loses poise under duress and can be rattled easily by pressure. Gets too jittery and anxious (overanalyzes) in big games and has a very low winning percentage vs. top-10 teams. Long-term durability is concerning.
Has a quick release and is light enough on his feet to escape the first wave and make some plays on the move. Solid decision-maker -- takes what the defense gives him. Fine short-to-intermediate accuracy. Good intangibles. Encouraging team leader with a likeable personality. Leads by example. Serves well as the face of the program. Outstanding work ethic. Is very intelligent and football smart. Experienced, four-year starter in the SEC.
Rounds 6-7
Diminutive, game-managing pocket passer still recovering from a torn ACL. Would benefit from a moving pocket that can create open throwing lanes, yet does not have the foot quickness desired for a rollout passing game. Possesses a skill set most ideally suited for a backup or Number 3 role. Intelligence, intangibles and experience are all pluses.
-------------------------
Cody_Latimer 2543590 56
Basketball was primary sport as an Ohio prep -- played receiver, defensive back and kick returner in his two seasons as a football player. Appeared in eight games as a true freshman in 2011 (two starts) and had 12 receptions for 141 yards (11.8-yard average) and two touchdowns. Did not play against Illinois and missed the final three games because of hernia surgery. Started 10-of-12 games in '12, recording 51-805-6 (15.8). Was the Hoosiers' leading receiver in '13 when he posted 72-1,096-9 (15.2) in 12 starts. Did not work out at the NFL Scouting Combine because of a left foot injury (medical exclusion).
Is high-cut and shows some lower-body stiffness in his route running. Average burst off the line. Not a quick-twitch athlete -- could struggle to shake loose from more athletic corners. Lacks foot speed to separate vertically. Is straightlinish after the catch and will not make anyone miss. Marginal special-teams utility. Football was not his first love.
Very good size. Shows a jab step to get into routes cleanly and is equipped to combat the jam. Can use his frame and physicality to create separation on slants and "post-up" throws (strength was evidenced by bench-pressing 225 pounds 23 times at the combine, leading all receivers and besting some linemen). Nice catch radius -- extends to snag throws off his body. Soft, dependable hands. Nice strength after the catch. Good blocker -- subdues cornerbacks, shields, stalks and sustains. Improved steadily over three years as a starter.
Rounds 4-5
A prep basketball standout, --NAME-- is a well-built, sure-handed, West Coast possession receiver whose hardwood background is evident in his leaping ability, body control and hand-eye coordination. Lacks ideal explosiveness, gear change and flexibility. Could be effective running slants and making contested catches to beat zone coverage and succeed in the red zone. Has a ceiling as a Number 3.
-------------------------
Anthony_Hitchens 2543592 119
Florida native who took initiative to move out of his biological parents' house and live with a friend's family in order to attend a better, safer school and remain focused on his football career. High school running back, linebacker and kick returner who had 3,864 career rushing yards and 52 touchdowns -- earned four varsity letters in addition to playing basketball and running track. Bounced between safety, linebacker and running back as a true freshman in 2010, recording nine tackles, zero for loss and zero sacks in 10 games played. Appeared in eight games in '11, tallying 25-0-0. Missed five games because of a knee sprain. Started all 11 games at Will linebacker in '12 and notched 124-5.5-1. Was benched during the Purdue contest after multiple blown assignments, and did not play against Michigan (illness). Was the Hawkeyes' leading tackler and Defensive MVP in '13 -- started all 13 games at Will and registered 112-13.5-2 with two pass breakups, an interception and two forced fumbles.
Is short and lacks bulk. Tends to play narrow-based and get rooted out of the hole on inside runs. Angles and anticipation could stand to improve -- is late to sort out misdirection. Very average cover instincts -- often is lured by play-action passing game. See-and-go reactor. Modest production for a weakside position where action is designed to be heavily funneled his way -- leaves some on the field.
Aggressive tackler. Flows fast to the ball (when he sees it) and has good playing range to the sideline. Plays bigger than his size and does not back down from big-bodied blockers or physical runners (see Ohio State). Fairly explosive hitter. Plays with a chip on his shoulder and is highly respected for his work ethic, makeup and overall approach. Is mentally and physically tough. Very durable despite lack of size (missed only one game in career).
Round 7-Priority free agent
An active, undersized, run-and-hit weakside linebacker, --NAME-- is at his best in a scheme where he is protected and free to run to the ball. Has shown gradual improvement and could stand to compete for a backup role.
-------------------------
Jeremiah_George 2543594 154
Prepped in Florida. Saw very limited action 2010-11 (wore jersey Number 7) -- recorded five tackles, zero for loss and zero sacks in 22 games over two seasons. Started 9-of-13 games in '12 and produced 87-4-0 with three pass breakups. Was the Cyclones' MVP in '13 when he was the Big 12's leading tackler -- registered 133-12-3.5 with six pass breakups and two interceptions. Team captain. Pulled a hamstring running the 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine and did not participate in positional drills, shuttle or 3-cone drill.
Marginal size (built like a box safety). Slew-footed. Runs around blocks and takes himself out of plays overpursuing and giving up the cutback. Not stout -- can be run at. Average zone awareness. See-and-go reactor -- late to trigger.
Is sudden stepping downhill and flashes some shock in his hands. Plays with urgency and leaves all his energy and effort on the field. Explosive short-area burst. Very good balance and body control. Flows fast to the sideline and has the speed to cut off backs at the corner. Intense, vocal team leader. Good work ethic. Strong for his size -- bench-pressed 225 pounds 28 times at the combine. Is committed to the game and competes hard. Has the makeup of a special-teams terror. Solid pro day showing.
Rounds 6-7
Undersized, run-and-hit linebacker most ideally suited for a special-teams role. Lack of size will relegate him to a fast-flowing 4-3 under front, where he could be best on the weak side where action is funneled to him and he has a clean path to the ball.
-------------------------
Dri_Archer 2543596 97
First name is pronounced "DREE". The Florida prep averaged 10.2 yards per carry as a senior, finished second in the 100-meter final of the state high school track meet (ahead of third-place finisher Denard Robinson) and also lettered in baseball. Played in 11 games as a true freshman in 2009, rushing 58 times for 246 yards (4.2-yard average) and one touchdown with 19 receptions for 231 yards (12.2) and three touchdowns. Missed one game due to coach's choice. Appeared in all 12 games (one start at RB) in '10 and carried 40-140-1 (3.5) and caught 16-75-1 (4.7). Was academically ineligible in '11, missing the entire season. Returned to the field in '12 and had a breakout year, setting a Kent State single-season record with 23 touchdowns. Ran for 159-1,429-16 (9.0) and caught 39-561-4 (15.6) in 14 games (11 starts at slot receiver). Returned three kickoffs for touchdowns and averaged 36.9 yards on 16 kickoff returns. Was a finalist for the Paul Hornung Award, honoring the nation's most versatile player. Was the MAC's Special Teams Player of the Year and first-team all-MAC at both running back and kick returner. Injured his left ankle during the first series of the '13 season and was hampered for much of September, missing early season games against Bowling Green and Penn State and seeing limited action against LSU. Played in 10 games (nine starts at slot receiver) and carried 68-527-6 (7.8) and caught 25-327-4 (13.1). Had a 100-yard kickoff return touchdown against Northern Illinois. Despite making just 21 collegiate starts, he finished his Kent State career ranked among the school's all-time leaders with 4,980 all-purpose yards and 40 touchdowns (24 rushing, 12 receiving, four kickoff returns).
Very short and rail thin with no strength or running power. Not a tackle-breaker and goes down easy on contact. Limited inside runner. Can be knocked off routes easily and struggles catching on contact. Not a nuanced route runner. Very marginal, underpowered blocker. Could stand to do a better job securing the ball in traffic. Is not ideally built to withstand a full NFL season.
Rare burst, acceleration and top-end speed to take the corner and create big plays. Can fly by MAC competition with top gear. Very good agility, balance, vision and creativity. Weaves through a crowd and can find daylight. Soft-handed and plucks the ball with ease. Extremely strong pound-for-pound. Very good career all-purpose yardage. Good versatility -- contributes as a runner, slot receiver and return man. Four career kickoff-return TDs (and was kicked away from). Clocked a 4.16-second 40-yard dash in 18 steps on one official handheld combine watch, tying Calvin Johnson's NFL Scouting Combine record for fewest steps. Has a 38-inch vertical jump.
Rounds 3-4
An injury-riddled senior season cannot eclipse what an explosive playmaker --NAME-- demonstrated he can be when healthy. Was slowed by an ankle injury early and did not return to junior form until late in senior season. Can make an immediate impact in the return game and add value as a multipurpose threat. Long-term durability is greatest concern given tiny frame.
-------------------------
Avery_Williamson 2543597 151
Prepped in Tennessee, where he played in two state championship games and was honored as the Outstanding Senior of his graduating class, recognizing academics, character and athletics. Played 12 games in 2010 and was credited with 10 tackles, zero for loss and zero sacks with a pass breakup. Appeared in 12 games in '11 and collected 49-1.5-0 with an interception and forced fumble. Started 24 games at middle linebacker and led the Wildcats in tackles his final two seasons -- totaled 135-4.5-3 with four pass breakups, an interception and two forced fumbles in '12; and 102-4-1 in '13. Team captain.
Average athletic ability and foot quickness -- is a step late to the perimeter. Struggles to disengage from blockers once he is locked up. Limited cover range and reactions -- is late to recognize and gets sucked up by playaction. Average functional strength. Is not a take-on thumper. His 30 1/2-inch vertical was worst among middle linebackers at the combine.
Good size. Plays with a good, wide base. Very productive tackler. Outstanding personal and football character -- works hard, is accountable and commands respect. Smart, understands the game and can make all the calls and on-field adjustments.
Rounds 5-6
A functional, between-the-tackles run stopper with a chance to make it on the inside of a 3-4 defense where he can patrol the middle. Can be targeted in coverage and will need to make a mark on special teams to stick.
-------------------------
IK_Enemkpali 2543598 210
His name is pronounced "EYE-KAY IN-em-PALL-ee." His full name is Ikemefuna Chinedum --NAME--. His parents were born in Nigeria. The Texas prep helped lead his school to the state playoffs during his two years as a starter. Enrolled at Louisiana Tech and redshirted in 2009; was part of the same freshman class as defensive line mate Justin Ellis. Saw action in 11 games (10 starts) at defensive end in '10 and had 36 tackles, six tackles for loss and 2.5 sacks. Missed one game with a sprained ankle. In April '11, he was arrested following an off-campus incident and was subsequently charged with disturbing the peace and battery of a police officer. Was initially suspended by the team, but was reinstated before the season began. In 13 games that fall, he recorded 33-7.5-3.5 with one forced fumble. Started all 12 game at RDE in '12 and totaled 32-7.5-6 with one pass batted and one forced fumble. In 12 starts at right defensive end in '13, he tallied 47-11-5.5 with one pass batted and two interceptions. Was one of two linemen in the country to have two interceptions, picking off passes against North Carolina State and North Texas.
Below-average height. Ultra-stiff and overly muscled, negating his quickness, speed and lateral agility. Green eyes and instincts -- gets outflanked too easily, is consistently late off the ball and can improve his snap anticipation and get-off quickness. Marginal hip flexibility. Lacks variety of pass-rush moves and gets hung up on blocks too easily. Can create better extension and improve hand use to swat, shed and disengage. Does not consistently convert speed to power. Bench-pressed 225 pounds only 19 times at the combine.
Very thickly built. Flashes shock and violence in his punch. Highly competitive, plays hard and motor runs hot. Keeps battling to the quarterback. Gave Texas A&M OLT and 2013 Number 2 overall pick Luke Joeckel fits in '12. Superb football character -- the game is very important to him. Film junkie. Tough and physical.
Round 7-Priority free agent
A strong, tenacious, tightly wound leverage-power rusher most ideally suited for a 3-4 outside linebacker role. Will require patience to develop. Has a high-collision special-teams temperament to contribute in coverage if he can learn to unlock his hips. Best chance will come in Blitzburgh.
-------------------------
Alfred_Blue 2543600 181
Baton Rouge-area native who earned all-state honors after rushing for 1,695 yards and 25 touchdowns as a high school senior. Played in 11 games (one start) as a true freshman for LSU in 2010, rushing 20 times for 101 yards (5.1-yard average) and one touchdown. Missed two games with a foot injury. Appeared in 13 games in '11 (one start) and carried 78-539-7 (6.9). Missed one game with an ankle injury and overcame the loss of his family's home in a September fire. Was off to a great start in '12 before tearing the ACL in his left knee in Week 3, which necessitated season-ending surgery. Started the first three games, including back-to-back 100-yard contests, and carried 40-270-2 (6.8) and caught 7-45-0 (6.4). Returned in '13 and played in all 13 games (two starts), amassing 71-343-1 (4.8) rushing and 5-62-0 (12.4) receiving. Was awarded a fifth season of eligibility by the NCAA due to the hardship rule, but decided to decline to pursue a pro career. Despite making just seven collegiate starts, he finished his LSU career with 209-1,253-11 (6.0) rushing and 16-105-0 (6.6) receiving.
Average initial quickness and lateral agility. Smoother than he is explosive. Can run with more consistent intensity and pad level on a carry-by-carry basis -- does not always run angry or lower his pads. Shows some stiffness as a route runner. Weak in pass protection -- needs to improve willingness, awareness, technique and physicality. Was never the feature back at LSU (seven career starts). Suffered a torn ACL in 2012. Made controversial, homophobic remarks and maturity should be looked into. Recorded a 4.56-second 20-yard shuttle time, the second-slowest of any back at the combine.
Terrific size and musculature. Inside-outside ability. Nice vision, instincts and patience. Has good speed for a back his size -- opens up his stride in the clear. Strong runner -- heavy on contact. Powers through arm tackles and runs with forward lean. Wields an effective stiff-arm. Looks to have good hands in limited exposure. Flashes playmaking ability. Has tread on his tires -- averaged just 52 carries per season at LSU. Has experience in a pro-style offense and on special teams. Clear upside.
Rounds 5-6
A physically gifted runner who would have been the Number 1 back at most schools given his combination of size, speed, power and competitiveness. Is a second-round talent on talent alone, but injuries and a stacked stable of LSU runners limited --NAME--'s opportunity to shine. Scheme-versatile runner who is a prime candidate to elevate his stock prior to the draft and be a far more productive pro than college player if he proves he can stay healthy.
-------------------------
Ego_Ferguson 2543602 51
Spent the first three years of high school in Maryland before transferring to Hargrave Military Academy as a senior. Redshirted in 2010. Spent his first two seasons at LSU backing up Eagles 2013 third-rounder Bennie Logan. Saw action in 13 games in '11 and managed 13 tackles, one-half tackle for loss and zero sacks with one batted pass. Did not play against Mississippi State. Came off the bench again in '12 and posted 14-1-0 with a pass batted down in 13 contests. Moved into the starting lineup in '13, logging 58-3.5-1 with three batted passes in 12 starts at defensive tackle. Was not allowed to travel to Tampa for the Outback Bowl for medical reasons. Did not work out at the NFL Scouting Combine because of a right ankle injury (medical exclusion).
Needs to get stronger through his core and base. Needs to quicken his hands and use them more violently. Raw counters and pass-rush moves. Power element is missing. Spends too much time idled at the line of scrimmage. Does not dominate single blocks and gets beat up by double teams. Limited two-gap ability. Disappears for long stretches. Only a one-year starter with minimal behind-the-line production.
Good size, foot speed, balance and athletic ability. Flashes the ability to stack, locate and shed. Bends his knees, redirects efficiently and has good range for a 300-pounder -- flows well laterally. Nice closing speed. Had disruptive potential.
Rounds 2-3
Athletic, raw, developmental three-technique with clear upside, though he is inexperienced, aimless and unrefined at this stage of his development. Needs more glass in his diet and simply does not impact games the way he should. Is likely to test well and be drafted higher than his performance dictates in the hopes a defensive line coach can tap into his potential.
-------------------------
Jeremy_Hill 2543603 55
Was a top Louisiana prep running back in 2010, rushing 302 times for 2,260 yards (7.5-yard average) and 36 touchdowns en route to being named to the Parade All-America team. Before graduating high school, though, he was arrested on sexual assault charges. Sat out the 2011 season and enrolled at LSU early the following year, participating in spring drills. Made his collegiate debut in the fall of '12 and played in 11 games (five starts), rushing 142-755-12 (5.3) and catching 8-73-0 (9.1). Did not play in LSU's first two games and carried just 13 times through six weeks, but went on to lead the Tigers in rushing. Started the final five games; in his first college start, he became the first true LSU freshman to rush for 100 yards against Alabama (29-107-1). Ran afoul of the law again in April '13, as he was arrested and charged with simple battery after being caught on video punching a man outside a bar near campus. After pleading guilty to a predatory attack for the second time in 15 months, he was given a six-month suspended jail sentence and two years of probation; as a result, he was to be on probation until July 12, 2015, but early termination of --NAME--'s probation was granted by a judge in March. Was suspended by coach Les Miles for the '13 opener and for the first quarter of LSU's ensuing game. Once he returned to the field, he registered one of the top seasons in school history, rushing 203-1,401-16 (6.9) and catching 18-181-0 (10.1) in 12 games (11 starts). His rushing total was the second-best single-season mark in school history, while his average yards per carry established an SEC record (eclipsing Garrison Hearst's 6.8 in 1992). Tied a school mark with seven 100-yard games, including a 28-216-2 performance in the Outback Bowl. Concluded his two-year college career with 2,410 all-purpose yards and no fumbles lost.
Average vision and balance. Shows some hip tightness and does not string moves together. Can do a better job running behind his pads between the tackles -- enters the hole upright, negating his ability to move the pile. Gears down to cut laterally and slide to another hole. Average second-level burst. Lacks elite top-end speed to pull away from the pack and can be tracked down before reaching the edge. Was not used extensively as a receiver and did not run a variety of routes. Was contained by Alabama. Has a 29-inch vertical jump. Character, maturity and stability must be investigated thoroughly.
Outstanding size. Good initial quickness -- gets rolling downhill in a hurry. Quick feet for a bigger back. Slashes through holes. Spins off tackles and picks up yards after contact. Shows good hands in limited exposure -- effective short receiver. Productive in a pro-style power offense -- averaged nearly 7 yards per carry as a sophomore.
Rounds 2-3
Big, thickly built, athletic slasher with an overinflated sense of his abilities and character red flags, which could cause some teams to shy away. Fits best in a downhill scheme and has potential to be a 20-carry back in the NFL, but must run to his size more consistently and prove his unstable behavior is behind him.
-------------------------
Zach_Mettenberger 2543605 178
The Georgia prep graduated early and enrolled at the University of Georgia in January 2009 and redshirted in the fall. Was arrested in March '10 and pleaded guilty to two counts of misdemeanor sexual battery and was dismissed from the Bulldogs. Spent the '10 campaign leading Butler County CC (Kan.) to an 11-1 record and the JUCO National Championship game after completing 176-of-299 passes for 2,678 yards (58.9 percent) with 32 touchdowns and four interceptions. Transferred to LSU in '11, seeing limited action in five games and posted 8-11-92-1-0 (72.7). Made all 13 starts in '12 and threw for 207-352-2,609-12-7 (58.8). In '13, logged 192-296-3,082-22-8 (64.9) in 12 starts. Did not play in the Outback Bowl against Iowa after suffering a torn ACL in his left knee against Arkansas in the regular-season finale. Is the only LSU quarterback to throw for 2,500 or more yards in back-to-back seasons. Two-time team captain and had a 19-6 record in 25 starts at LSU and 30-7 as a collegiate QB. Did not work out at the NFL Scouting Combine because of knee injury.
Heavy-footed with a long delivery, which translates to the pocket closing on him quickly when he moves and is forced off a spot. Takes unnecessary sacks and is rattled easily under duress. Really labors to hasten his release and get rid of the ball quickly when needed. Has tunnel vision and arms the ball too much. Tends to trigger late and frequently underthrows the deep ball. Does not throw receivers open and forces them to adjust. Can learn to take pace off the ball and throw with more touch, better timing and anticipation. Had a very strong supporting cast with NFL-caliber receivers and a stout offensive line. Weight fluctuated early in his career and arrived at LSU pushing 260 pounds. Is coming off an ACL injury and will require some rehabilitation time. Character will require closer scrutiny.
Exceptional size. Outstanding arm strength -- spins it with velocity and can make all the throws. Can drill the deep out and fit it into a tight window across the field throwing to his left. Ran an NFL-style offense under coordinator Cam Cameron and learned how to become more of a leader as a senior.
Rounds 4-5
Pure dropback, strong-armed thrower who will require patient, confidence-building play-calling and a clean pocket to function at a high level in the NFL. Has starter talent in a vertical, downfield passing attack if he can learn to take command of a huddle and continue progressing as a decision-maker. How he interviews with teams could go a long way toward determining his draft status.
-------------------------
Trai_Turner 2543606 92
New Orleans native. As a high school freshman, was asked to provide depth as a varsity reserve, but refused because he thought he was better than the starters. Separated his shoulder in the first game of his senior season and had surgery after the season. Redshirted in 2011. Played 12 games in '12, starting the final seven at right guard in place of Josh Williford, whose career was cut short by concussions. Started all 13 games at right guard in '13. Suffered an ankle contusion against Auburn, but did not miss any starts. Totaled 115 career knockdowns. Did not perform the shuttles at the NFL Scouting Combine because of a hip flexor injury.
Lacks ideal length. Has thick hips and a fleshy midsection, which affects his ability to maneuver, position and fit. Ordinary hip snap. Has balance issues. Tends to bend at the waist and let his weight drift over his toes. Body control wanes the farther he travels. Technique needs work.
Good overall body mass. Walls off defenders and generates movement in the run game. Can latch on and keep defenders at bay. Has experience locking horns with NFL-caliber defensive tackles, both in SEC games and practice. Will be a 21-year-old rookie. Registered the best 10-yard split (1.73 seconds), 20-yard shuttle (4.44 seconds) and the only sub-5-flat 40 time of all guards at the combine.
Rounds 2-3
--NAME-- is a squarely built interior blocker built for road grading, though he has not demonstrated the ability to dominate as a third-year sophomore draft entrant. Could obviously have used another year of college experience, but has size and run-blocking potential in a power-running scheme. Could prove to be a better center than guard and offers swing interior versatility.
-------------------------
Kendall_James 2543607 184
Defensive back-receiver who also played basketball and was a member of a state-champion track squad as a New Jersey prep. Redshirted in 2009. Played in 11 games in '10 and made 16 tackles with zero pass breakups and zero interceptions as a reserve defensive back and special-teams player. Started 13 games at right cornerback in '11 and had 50-4-3 with one forced fumble. In '12, he registered 46-12-3 with two forced fumbles in 11 starts at RCB. Scored his lone collegiate touchdown on a 100-yard interception return at Bryant. In '13, recorded 36-9-2 with 2.5 tackles for loss in 13 starts at RCB. Also had a blocked field goal against New Hampshire. Did not broad jump at the NFL Scouting Combine (hamstring).
Does not look the part -- is skinny with extremely short arms and small hands. Must bulk up and get functionally stronger -- gets wired to blocks. Bench-pressed 225 pounds just nine times at the combine, one of the lowest totals among DBs. Does not have strength to press -- will be outmuscled by larger receivers outside the numbers. Tackles low and needs help from the cavalry when he cannot chop down ball carriers with momentum. Lacks experience playing inside.
Outstanding timed speed and leaping ability (39-inch vertical). Terrific balance, body control and agility. Fluid and flexible with loose hips and ankles to transition and change direction smoothly. Mirrors in man coverage. Aware in zone. Plants and drives quickly. Shows burst to close and recover. Good ball skills. Will come up and stick his nose in run support. Has special-teams experience as a gunner. Three-year starter.
Rounds 4-5
Undersized, extremely short-armed, feisty corner with potential to contribute as a sub-package defender. Offers appealing fluidity, twitch, speed and ball skills, though he will always face size and strength limitations..
-------------------------
Dexter_McDougle 2543608 80
Virginia prep missed most of his junior season, breaking two of his knuckles in a freak practice injury. Redshirted in 2009. Saw his first game action in '10, appearing in 11 games and recording 22 tackles, three pass breakups and zero interceptions. Returned five kickoffs for 71 yards (14.2-yard average). His season was cut short in early December when he was involved in a scooter accident, requiring surgery to repair a broken collarbone. Was elevated to starting cornerback in '11 and had 44-6-3 with 2.5 tackles for loss and one forced fumble in 12 games. Scored on a 66-yard fumble return against North Carolina State. Started all 12 games at cornerback in '12 and recorded 71-5-0 with three tackles for loss. Made three starts in '13, tallying 14-2-3, before suffering a season-ending injury Sept. 14. Late that afternoon against Connecticut, in a game in which he already had two interceptions (including a 49-yard touchdown return), he dove low for a tackle and severely jammed his shoulder, necessitating surgery. Spent the rest of his college season traveling to every away game, attending every practice and sitting through every meeting. As a result, coach Randy Edsall presented him with the inaugural --NAME-- Ultimate Team Player Award at Maryland's end-of-year banquet. Shoulder injury prevented him from working out at the NFL Scouting Combine (medical exclusion).
Lacks ideal height. Short on length and strength to jam and re-route receivers -- too often yields uncontested release off the line. Occasionally gets caught trying to read the quarterback's mail -- squats on routes, bites on fakes and gets beat. Durability could be an issue.
Excellent speed to keep pace vertically. Reads and reacts quickly. Mirrors off the line. Good balance, agility and change of direction. Zone aware. Plants and drives efficiently. Has short-area quickness and stop-and-start acceleration. Covers ground with the ball in the air and shows burst to close. Solid tackler. Fits in multiple schemes. Good teammate.
Rounds 6-7
Short, compactly built, athletic cornerback who was playing well when he suffered a season-ending shoulder injury in September. Has the speed, quickness, competitiveness and toughness to compete for a role as a sub-package slot defender.
-------------------------
Pat_O'Donnell 2543611 191
Was a three-year letterwinner in track and football as a Florida prep. Began his collegiate career at Cincinnati and punted in three games in 2009, recording seven punts for a 37.9-yard average with a long of 50 and two punts inside the 20-yard line, before redshirting with an undisclosed injury. Booted 52.41.9-L61-16 in '10. Was a first-team All-Big East selection in '11 after logging 63-43.8-L76-26 punting and 61 kickoffs for a 64.2-yard average and seven touchbacks. In '12, booted 59-41.8-L65-23 and 75-63.4-36 on kickoffs. Graduated from Cincinnati and transferred to Miami (Fla.) for his final season in '13. Set the Hurricanes' single-season record with a 47.1-yard-per-punt average after recording 53-47.1-L71-19 and 79-63.1-37 on kickoffs. Was also the holder on field goals and extra point attempts. Did 23 repetitions of 225 pounds on the bench press at the NFL Scouting Combine -- more than six tight ends, 19 running backs, 21 defensive linemen and all 37 wide receivers.
Inconsistent hang time. Can improve placement and accuracy. Average athlete. Overly analytical and outthinks the game. Could stand to hone his mental toughness and learn to handle pressure.
Very good leg strength to drive the ball. Experienced four-year starter. Handles kickoffs and served as the holder on PATs. Dedicated to his craft and the game is important to him.
Round 7-Priority free agent
Outstanding-sized, right-footed, two-step punter transferred from Cincinnati upon graduation to be closer to home and hone his own technique. Has the leg strength to compete for a job, but must continue to hone his control and improve his directional punting.
-------------------------
Donte_Moncrief 2543614 90
Highly recruited Mississippi prep who also played basketball and won a pair of long jump state championships. As a true freshman in 2011, started all 12 games at split end and recorded 31 receptions for 454 yards (14.6-yard average) and four touchdowns. Was the Rebels' leading receiver in '12 when he started 12-of-13 games (gave way to extra tight end against Texas) and snagged 66-979-10 (14.8). Started all 13 games in '13 and posted 59-938-6 (15.9).
Needs to sharpen his route running. Inconsistent ball reactions, particularly in traffic -- better running through or under passes. Does not always play to his size -- gets outmuscled for "50-50" balls and is still coming into his own as a dependable go-up-and-get-it guy. Average hand strength. Tends to trap some throws against his body and occasionally drops catchable balls. Could be more physical. Average elusiveness and open-field electricity. Showed he could be contained -- seven games of 60 yards or less as a junior.
Terrific size. Smooth accelerator -- jets off the line, eliminates cushion and has speed to stretch the field vertically. Good balance and body control. Can stem his pattern and leverage defenders. Drives off cornerbacks and creates separation. Knows where the sticks are. Outstanding leaping ability to elevate and pluck throws out of the air. Flashes playmaking ability. Able to sidestep the first tackler and pick up chunk yards after the catch. Gives effort as a blocker to engage and seal. Has experience going head-to-head with NFL-caliber cornerbacks. Will be a 21-year-old rookie and has upside. Tied for the longest broad jump (11-foot) among receivers at the combine.
Rounds 1-2
Big, physically gifted "X" receiver with deep speed, leaping potential and playmaking ability. Could emerge a Number 1 or Number 2 receiver in a vertical passing offense, and his best football is in front him. Solid combine showing and pro-day workout have ascended his draft standing.
-------------------------
Walt_Powell 2543619 196
Brother, Brandon Williams, was a 49ers third-rounder in 2006. Wore jersey Number 82 his first two seasons. As a true freshman in 2010, saw limited action in all 11 games and caught three balls for 16 yards (5.3-yard average) and zero touchdowns. Took ownership of the Racers' "Z" receiver position in '11 when he started 7-of-11 games and produced 45-584-5 (13.0). Established MSU single-season receiving records in '12 -- started all 11 games and racked up 94-1213-10 (12.9). Added 23 kickoff returns for 604 yards (26.3) and 19 punt returns for 301 yards (15.8), including two scores. Started all 10 games played in '13, totaling 66-837-13 (12.7) receiving and 11-346 (31.5), including a score, on kickoffs. Suffered a foot injury and was sidelined the final two games of the season against Tennessee State and Eastern Kentucky. Was arrested in October and charged with 4th-degree assault (domestic violence) and theft by unlawful taking (less than $500) stemming from an incident at the Calloway County Fairgrounds -- ultimately charges were dropped when a grand jury found insufficient evidence. Was the Pacers' leading receiver three straight years. Team captain.
Has a thin build and short arms. Needs to get stronger -- ill-equipped to combat press coverage. Not an explosive, quick-twitch athlete. Average hands and foot speed. Route running needs refinement. Underpowered blocker.
Loose lower body. Good balance and short-area quickness. Slippery after the catch -- can elude the first tackler and dart to daylight. Shows confidence and a knack for finding creases as a returner -- four scores the last two seasons. Productive three-year starter. Smart and competitive. Two-time team captain with terrific intangibles -- cares about the game and works at his craft.
Priority free agent
Lean, short-armed, smoother-than-sudden receiver/return man who will need the benefit of a free slot release given his pedestrian speed and strength. Intangibles and return skills will have to carry him, as he lacks distinguishable athletic traits.
-------------------------
Spencer_Long 2543620 78
Native Nebraskan. Walked on and redshirted in 2009. Did not see action in '10. Stepped into the lineup in '11, starting all 13 games at right guard. Played through a torn right meniscus in '12, starting all 14 games at RG. In '13, started the first six games at RG before tearing his right MCL against Purdue and undergoing season-ending surgery and did not work out at the NFL Scouting Combine because of it (medical exclusion). Elected not to lift at the combine because of an appendectomy. Team captain.
Average athlete. Is tight-ankled and heavy-legged -- lumbers to the second level. Struggled with the quickness of Minnesota's Ra'shede Hageman (though he was noticeably playing through a knee injury that required surgery and forced him to miss the rest of the season after leaving the Minnesota game). Labors to cut off the inside rush. Struggles to adjust and pick off linebackers and is not efficient pulling and trapping.
Very solidly built with a good frame. Good leg drive -- can create a push in the run game and position-sustain. Solid in pass protection -- good anchor, shadow and mirror. Good base and balance -- controls and steers defenders. Flashes some nastiness. Intense, competitive battler. Smart and instinctive. Lunchpail worker will do a lot of extras and is very ambitious and driven to succeed. Excellent weight-room strength -- can squat a small house. Good versatility -- has played inside and outside. Very tough and played much of final two seasons through knee injuries. Possessed the biggest hands of any offensive lineman at the combine.
Rounds 3-4
Big, tough, physical, ornery blocker with starter-quality positional traits and intangible qualities. Is best in a phone booth, where he excels as a run and pass blocker, and is smart and savvy enough to contribute outside in emergency situations.
-------------------------
Russell_Bodine 2543622 111
Last name is pronounced "BO-dine." Prepped at Fork Union (Va.) Military Academy, where his father is a teacher. Redshirted in 2010. Was a backup in '11 -- played nine games, including two starts as an injury replacement. Started all 25 games 2012-13.
Stiff-bodied. Plays short-armed and overextends. Average agility. Is late to switch off blocks. Relies too much on his upper-body strength. Mechanics deteriorate the farther he is asked to travel. Slow to adjust to counter moves. Produced the slowest 3-cone time (8.29 seconds) of any offensive lineman at the combine.
Carries a load in his punch and plays with vinegar. Can seal and turn defenders in the run game to create small creases. Plays with a mean streak and likes to finish blocks. Is aggressive working up to the second level and efficient cutting linebackers. Rugged competitor. Stout anchor in pass protection. Versatile and has seen action at center and guard. Excellent weight-room strength -- bench-pressed 225 pounds 42 times to lead all participants at the combine.
Rounds 3-4
A top-heavy, barrel-chested, thick-bodied, short-area blocker, --NAME-- plays with a gritty football demeanor. Swing-interior versatility adds to his value.
-------------------------
Jabari_Price 2543624 225
Played cornerback and safety as a Florida prep. Was selected as an All-American Scholar by the United States Achievement Academy. Enrolled at North Carolina in 2010 and played in all 13 games as a true freshman, recording 20 tackles, five pass breakups and one interception. Started the final four games of the season at left cornerback and saw significant action on special teams. During fall practice prior to the '11 campaign, he tore a tendon in his left hand during a blocking drill (which necessitated surgery) and missed the first five games. In eight contests after his return (two starts), he had 16-2-0 with one tackle for loss. Made 11 starts in '12 and registered 76-9-1 with four tackles for loss, one sack and one forced fumble. Missed the season finale with a shoulder injury. Was healthy all season in '13, tallying 80-9-0 with 4.5 tackles for loss and one forced fumble in 13 starts.
Adequate size. Limited instincts and anticipation. Loses separation at the break point. Loses phase when his eyes get stuck in the backfield. Tends to clutch and grab. Dull plant-and-drive. Was not a playmaker -- recorded just two career INTs. Still has some maturing to do.
Good speed and acceleration -- can turn and run deep. Competes in the air. Aggressive, productive tackler -- doesn't hesitate to support the run. Has worked as a gunner on special teams.
Rounds 5-6
Fairly nondescript cornerback who does not excel in man or zone coverage. Speed and tackling ability play well on special teams, where he will have to stand out to have a chance.
-------------------------
Brandon_Dixon 2543626 195
Prepped in Florida. Began his college career at Joliet Junior College (Ill.) in 2010, appearing in 10 games and recording 21 tackles, four pass breakups and three interceptions with 2.5 tackles for loss and one sack. In '11, tallied 37-7-2 in seven games with one-half tackle for loss. Moved on to Division II Northwest Missouri State in '12, lining up opposite his brother at the cornerback spots. In 13 starts, he totaled 38-5-5 with one tackle for loss. Had two interceptions in his Bearcat debut against East Central, including a 38-yard touchdown return. Also had two punt returns for 27 yards. Registered 36-11-1 with one tackle for loss and a fumble return for a touchdown in '13 (14 starts). Helped lead his school to the NCAA Division II football championship.
Has small hands. Lacks elite explosion and top-end speed. Ordinary leaping ability and ball skills to contend with taller high fliers. Faulty diagnostic skills -- processes slowly and reacts more than he anticipates. Gets caught squatting and peeking. Inconsistent tackler. Poor football aptitude -- requires extra reps to grasp complicated assignments.
Excellent size, musculature and body length. Nice balance and body control. Quick-footed to mirror off the line. Can flip his hips and run vertically. Good plant-and-drive quickness. Willing to step up and throw his weight around in run support. Has special-teams experience. Tough and durable. Competitive and motivated.
Rounds 5-6
Big, athletic, Division II standout and JUCO product whose size, length and physicality will appeal to teams in search of a developmental press corner. Could also be viewed as a potential safety conversion, but does not exhibit requisite instincts and dependability as a tackler.
-------------------------
Troy_Niklas 2543628 52
Highly recruited two-way lineman/tight end out of Anaheim (Calif.) Servite, where he won a state title. Nephew of Hall of Famer Bruce Matthews. Played outside linebacker as a true freshman in 2011, when he played 12 games (one start) and collected 20 tackles, one-half for loss and zero sacks. Did not play in the Champs Sports Bowl against Florida State. Converted to tight end and backed up Bengals '13 first-rounder Tyler Eifert in '12 -- started 7-of-13 games and tallied 5 catches for 75 yards (15-yard average) and a touchdown. Took on a more prominent role in '13 when he started all 13 games and produced 32-498-5 (15.6). Elected not to run the 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine. Did not work out at pro day because of double-hernia surgery performed on March 11.
Work in progress as an in-line blocker -- lacks ideal base strength, grip strength and overall body power. Bends at the waist and falls off some blocks. Route running needs refinement. Is still learning to use his frame advantageously -- inconsistent traffic player. Lacks elite top-end speed. Average elusiveness and creativity after the catch. Could stand to play with more physicality and become a better finisher.
Outstanding size with a well-proportioned, muscular build. Big target over the middle and in the red zone. Athletic with flexible hips and knees to run the full tight end route tree. Bursts into routes and stretches the seam. Good hands. Has playmaking ability. Lined up flexed and in-line. Good potential as a blocker. Bends his knees, shuffles and fans rushers wide. Works well in tandem and can combo block effectively. Takes care of his body and maintains low body fat. Has NFL bloodlines.
Rounds 2-3
A converted DE/OLB who emerged from the shadow of Bengals 2013 first-rounder Tyler Eifert, --NAME-- is the latest in a strong line of NFL tight ends produced by Notre Dame. He boasts an intriguing combination of size, athleticism, receiving ability and blocking ability to develop into a bona fide, balanced, Number 1 tight end. Has played tight end for just two years and is clearly ascending.
-------------------------
Chris_Watt 2543629 89
Suburban Chicago native prepped at Glenbard West, where he was a USA Today and Parade All-American. Had surgery to repair a torn labrum after his senior season and redshirted in 2009. Backed up --NAME-- Stewart at right guard in '10, appearing in all 13 games (117 snaps). Started all 26 games at left guard 2011-12. In '13, started all 11 games played at LG -- tore his right PCL against Air Force and did not play against Navy, then tore his right MCL against Stanford. Was sidelined for the Pinstripe Bowl against Rutgers as well as the Senior Bowl. Pulled left quad while attempting 40-yard dash at pro day.
Lacks ideal arm length and does not have large hands. Needs more sand in his pants. Susceptible to bull rush when powerful tackles get into his frame. Average athlete. Inconsistent connecting with moving targets in space. Missed his final bowl game after suffering a knee injury.
Engages quickly and runs his feet on contact. Effective with an angle and can swing his hips in the hole. Generates movement in the run game and works to finish blocks. Good bend and balance -- plays on his feet. Sound fundamentals in pass protection. Strong, active hands to punch and control defenders. Can shuffle and slide. Good mobility. Works well in tandem. Smart and alert. Praised for his toughness and blue-collar work ethic. Three-year starter.
Rounds 3-4
Good-sized, physical, competitive, bump-and-steer technician with starter-caliber ability in multiple schemes. Has a desirable temperament for the position and is a projectable, low-risk prospect.
-------------------------
Corey_Linsley 2543631 161
Prepped in Ohio where he also was a state champion discus thrower and state champion and All-American shot putter. Played through a shoulder injury as a senior. Redshirted in 2009. Appeared in six games as a reserve in '10 and 10 games as a reserve in '11. Started all 12 games at center in '12 despite hurting his foot against Illinois in early November. Had it surgically repaired and sat out the following spring. Started all 14 games at center in '13. Team captain.
Has short arms. More strong than explosive -- doesn't roll his hips and blow nose tackles off the ball. Falls off blocks when he bends at the waist. Pedestrian foot athlete -- slow to cut off linebackers, labors to pull and lacks lateral quickness to recover when beaten. Stressed by quicker rushers. Tied for the lightest offensive lineman at the combine.
Stout base. Works to re-anchor. Jolting punch. Strong upper body to latch onto and control defenders in short area. Generates movement in the run game. Understands angles and positioning. Excellent weight-room strength -- bench-presses 500 pounds and squats a small house. Smart and dependable. Communicated all the line calls and checks. Is tough and will play hurt. Hardworking team captain with leadership traits.
Round 7-Priority free agent
Strong-bodied, heavy-handed, short-area mauler who anchored one of the nation's most physical, productive rushing attacks. Has athletic limitations, but compensates with strength, smarts and competitiveness. Has the makeup to overachieve, and could increase his value by proving versatile enough to back up at guard.
-------------------------
Trey_Millard 2543632 245
Was OU's primary fullback as a true freshman in 2010, rushing 24 times for 74 yards (3.1-yard average) and three touchdowns with 16 receptions for 135 yards (8.4) and one touchdown in 14 games (two starts). Earned all-Big 12 honors in 2011, with 24 rushes for 169 yards and two TDs and 13 catches for 127 yards and a TD in 13 games (three starts). Had a career-long 61-yard touchdown run at Kansas State. Had 63 touches in 2012, with 33 rushes for 198 yards and no TDs and 30 catches for 337 yards and four TDs in 13 games (eight starts). Had a career-best receiving day against Texas, with five catches for 119 yards and a TD, including a 73-yard reception. Was in the midst of a solid 2013 campaign when he tore his left ACL Oct. 26, requiring season-ending surgery. It marked the first time he missed a college game. In OU's first eight games (five starts), he had rushed 17 times for 97 yards and a TD and caught 11 passes for 78 yards and a TD. Earned all-conference honors for the third straight year. Concluded his career with 32 special teams tackles. Ran for the first time since knee surgery in February 2014. Team captain.
Limited burst, change of direction and short-area explosion -- one-speed runner with no gear change. Average power and tackle-breaking ability. Shows some tightness as a route runner. Not a true hammer as a lead blocker and does not jolt defenders on contact. Might not be 100 percent as a rookie following ACL surgery.
Outstanding size. Hits with some thump and is an efficient lead blocker. Nice run skills -- shows vision, patience and subtle moves to avoid direct contact. Soft hands. Adjusts well to the ball and possesses better body control and agility than a traditional iso-lead blocking fullback. Blue-collar worker. Leads by example. Quietly competitive. Determined short-yardage runner capable of finding a crease and slamming through the line. Has a special-teams temperament (has delivered knockout shots). Solid all-around production. Versatile, lines up all over the field (fullback, tailback, in the slot) and does everything well (can run, block, catch and cover kicks). Very intelligent and football smart.
Round 7-Priority free agent
A versatile jack-of-all-trades, Milllard brings the most value as a core special-teams contributor. Is best suited for a role as a fullback in a matchup-based offense where he could fill a variety of roles. Has been very reliable and durable throughout his career, but late October ACL injury could still require some rehabilitation as a rookie and could affect his draft standing.

Terrance_Mitchell 2543637 254
Cornerback-running back who also lettered in basketball as a California prep. Redshirted in 2010. Won the starting left cornerback job in 2011 and had 45 tackles, 10 pass breakups and two interceptions with three tackles for loss and three forced fumbles in 14 games (12 starts). Started all 13 games at LCB in 2012 and recorded 40 tackles, eight pass breakups and no INTs. Made 13 starts at LCB in 2013 and tallied 59 tackles, seven pass breakups and five INTs (one TD) with one forced fumble. Was ejected in the first quarter of the season opener against Nicholls for a targeting infraction. Did not bench press at the combine (pectoral).
Has short arms and small hands. Is lean and functionally weak -- lacks press strength to impede receivers off the line. Tight-hipped. Gets wired on blocks outside. Needs to clean up his pedal. Inefficient plant-and-drive -- average balance and body control through transition. Falls out of the hip pocket and loses phase downfield. Lacks elite top-end speed and recovery burst -- needs help on explosive receivers. Average physicality and tackling ability. Tends to clutch and grab and draw flags.
Good size and length with a well-proportioned body. Quick-footed pedal. Shows read-and-react skills and nice anticipation to break on throws. Good hand-eye coordination. Gambler's mentality that enables him to make plays. High school skill-position traits show after he intercepts. Aggressive and competitive. Three-year starter. Recorded the best three-cone drill (6.57 seconds) and 20-yard shuttle (tie, 4.00) among cornerbacks at the combine.
Rounds 3-4
Wiry, smoother-than-sudden, off-man/cover-3 corner who upped his visibility as a junior by showing improved playmaking ability, which prompted a premature leap to the NFL. Could compete for a job as a Number 4, but lack of ideal explosiveness, top-end speed and bump-and-run ability limits his ceiling.

De'Anthony_Thomas 2543638 124
The five-star recruit out of Los Angeles was rated as the top athlete in the country as a prep. Rushed for 1,299 yards on only 114 carries (11.4-yard average) as a senior. Also starred in track, running the fastest 200 meters (20.61 seconds) in the country in the spring of 2010. Burst onto the collegiate scene in 2011, earning Pac-12 co-Offensive Freshman of the Year and was a first-team Pac-12 kick returner. Saw action in all 14 games (six starts, including the last five), rushing 55 times for 595 yards (10.8-yard average) and seven scores and catching 46 passes for 605 yards (13.2) and nine touchdowns. Had a huge impact as a returner with 36 kick returns for 983 yards (27.3), including a 96-yard score against USC and a 93-yard touchdown vs. Washington State. Had only three punt returns for 52 yards (17.3). Was the only player in the nation with 400 or more yards as a rusher, receiver and kick returner. Continued his versatility in 2012, becoming the first Oregon player in 47 years to score a touchdown rushing, receiving, returning a punt and returning a kickoff in the same season in 13 games (nine starts). Had a team-high 45 catches for 445 yards and five TDs and rushed 92 times for 701 yards and 11 TDs; also returned 13 punts for 222 yards and a TD and 16 kickoffs for 389 yards and a TD, including a 94-yard kickoff return touchdown in the Fiesta Bowl against Kansas State and a 73-yard punt return for a TD against Colorado. Also anchored the 4x100-meter relay team that advanced to the NCAA championships for the Ducks track team. Began the 2013 campaign as the starting running back before injuring his left ankle on the opening kickoff against California and missing the next three games. Rushed 96 times for 594 yards and eight TDs and had 22 catches for 246 yards and a TD; also had 21 kickoff returns for 513 yards (24.4) and a TD in 10 games (five starts), including an 86-yard touchdown against Utah. Holds Oregon career records for kickoff return yards (1,885) and punt return average (17.1).
Very small. Does not play in a conventional-style offense and takes most carries moving laterally. Goes down too easily and looks for a soft landing spot. Lacks the size, strength and toughness to be an every-down back. Alligator-arms the ball in the middle of the field. Needs to learn to appreciate the preparation process and would benefit from working more at his craft.
Has legit big-time sprinter's speed with very quick turnover and is field-fast. Cat-quick to the corner, accelerates very quickly and can easily take the perimeter. Good vision and cutback ability -- is patient and follows his blocks. Can tightrope-walk the sideline. Very quick to and through the hole once he sees a crease and can stick his foot in the dirt and go. Catches in stride with ease and can make difficult one-handed snags (see Arizona). Has home-run speed in the return game, with three career return TDs. Exceptional pro day performance.
Rounds 3-4
A deluxe, specialty back and potential slot receiver with game-breaking return ability, --NAME-- can be an explosive mismatch weapon in multiple facets of the game. Diminutive stature will decrease the odds he'll be able to stay healthy in the pros, and his commitment to the game will dictate his future success. Rare speed creates a higher commodity on draft day.

Revealed at the NFL combine that he elected to leave school one year early to support his family; his mother works two jobs, and his father still works despite having a leg amputated.
Needs to play with lower pad level. Tends to rush upright and defend too tall against the run. Dominated by double teams. Needs to cultivate pass-rush moves and counters -- does not have a plan. Shows overall body stiffness. Struggles to dip and bend the corner with leverage or flexibility. Gets sucked inside and loses contain. Loafs on the back side. Has tweener traits -- lacks ideal athleticism for the right side and bulk for the left side. Inexperienced playing in reverse.
Put together -- has a well-proportioned, muscular build with long arms and big hands. Good burst off the snap. Flashes power. Can shoot his hands, extend and get under a tackle's pads. Generally plays on his feet. Nice closing speed when he has a bead. Strong tackler. Tries for the strip (10 career FFs). Productive three-year starter.
Rounds 2-3
Strong, athletic, raw defensive end prospect who would have been better served returning for his senior season. Despite being rough around the edges at this stage of his development, --NAME-- shows in flashes and has power potential as a 4-3 defensive end. Could require patience.

Tom_Savage 2543640 135
His brother, Bryan, was a quarterback for Wisconsin (2004-05) and Hofstra (2007-08). The Pennsylvania prep was a three-year starter at QB and a U.S. Army All-America selection. Had a foot injury as a junior that ended his season. Began his college career at Rutgers in 2009, when he earned Freshman All-America honors as a true freshman by completing 149 of 285 passes for 2,211 yards (52 percent) with 14 touchdowns and seven interceptions in 12 games (11 starts). Went 43-of-83 (51.8) for 521 yards with two touchdowns and three INTs in six games in 2010; started the first four games before injuring his right hand and losing his starting job. Transferred to Arizona to play for head coach Mike Stoops but had to sit out the 2011 season because of NCAA transfer rules. After Stoops was fired and Rich Rodriguez was hired, he decided to transfer again to an offense that suited him better. Tried to go back to Rutgers, but hardship waiver was denied by the NCAA, so he enrolled at Pittsburgh. Had to sit out the 2012 season as a transfer. Finally returned to the field in 2013 and started all 13 games for Pitt, going 238-of-389 (61.2) for 2,958 yards with 21 TDs and nine INTs. Suffered a concussion against Virginia and bruised ribs in the Little Caesars Bowl vs. Bowling Green. Had a 17-11 record in 28 career starts. Team captain.
Needs to speed up his clock and show better awareness in the pocket. Needs to quicken his eyes, expand his field vision and learn to manipulate safeties. Tends to stare down his target. Forces some throws into traffic. Erratic accuracy. Slow of foot -- not a scramble threat. Can improve play-action fake. Had some duds -- struggled against Florida State, Virginia and Virginia Tech. Mental toughness needs to be looked into.
Terrific size. Sets with balance. Easy, compact, high three-quarters release. Spins a catchable ball. Excellent arm strength to complete NFL throws -- capable of sticking outs from the deep hash or launching balls 60 yards on the money. Experience in pro-style offense. Smart and hardworking. Solid personal and football character. Has tools to work with. Team captain.
Rounds 5-6
Big, inconsistent pocket passer who took a circuitous route to Pittsburgh, where he played a full season for the first time since 2009. Is inconsistent and in need of more reps, but has ample arm talent to warrant developmental consideration if teams deem his intangibles worthy of an investment.
-------------------------

Also rushed 11 times in his career for 77 yards (7.5) and zero touchdowns. Owns the school's career receptions record (202). Team captain.
Has a thin build and could stand to pack on body armor -- durability could be an issue. Needs to get stronger, particularly to improve his release vs. the jam. Builds to speed and is not a threat to take the top off. Leggy and fairly straight-linish -- does not pop out of breaks or separate with quickness. Inconsistent route runner. Not aggressive or physical as a blocker. Can be more cognizant of ball security -- carries loosely and swings the ball away from his body. Limited special-teams utility.
Has excellent length and room for added bulk. Chews up ground with long strides. Is a big target underneath with a sizable catch radius. Shows natural receiving skills to track, concentrate and adjust. Soft, dependable hands to extend and pull in a throw off his body. Uses his big frame to post up defensive backs. Nice field awareness. Lined up outside and inside. Solid personal and football character. Productive, 40-game starter. Team captain.
Rounds 4-5
Pitt's all-time leading pass catcher, --NAME-- is a narrowly built, long-levered, smooth-muscled receiver whose best assets are his length and hands. Needs to incorporate more physicality into his overall game, but has the ability to be an effective zone beater and red-zone target.
-------------------------
Nat_Berhe 2543643 152
His last name is pronounced "burr-HEY." Lettered in football and track as a California prep.  Redshirted in 2009.

Cornerback size with short arms and small hands. Has a light frame with limited weight potential and could stand to get stronger. Plays a bit out of control and will miss some tackles in the open field. Takes some bad angles. Leaks yards when he comes in high and has to grab and drag instead of driving through the ball carrier. Average production on the ball. Limited special-teams experience.
Instinctive defender with a nose for the ball. Secondary leader. Reads and reacts quickly. Active and energetic -- terrific pursuit effort. Motor runs hot. Plays fast. Good balance and body control. Smooth pedal. Good ball reactions. Disguises coverages. Sells blitzes and baits quarterbacks (see vs. Fresno State's Derek Carr). Tough, confident and competitive. Aggressive tackler. Plays with abandon. Flashes explosive striking ability. Lives and breathes football. Experienced, four-year starter with desirable makeup. Very likable personality.
Rounds 4-5
Compactly built, highly competitive strong safety who flies around the field, though he lacks ideal speed. Has the look of a solid backup and core special-teams player with potential to compete for a more prominent role down the line.
-------------------------
Bruce_Ellington 2543646 106
His cousin Andre --NAME-- starred as a running back for Clemson and plays for the Arizona Cardinals. South Carolina native was a highly recruited two-sport star who won a state championship as a quarterback and lettered four times in basketball. Did not play football in 2010. Played all 13 games in 2011, starting two, and caught 17 balls for 211 yards (12.4-yard average) and a touchdown with 20 kickoff returns for 463 yards (23.1). Started all 13 games in 2012, producing 40 catches for 600 yards (15.0) and seven touchdowns and returning 18 kickoffs for 406 yards (22.6).

Also was the starting point guard on the basketball team for three seasons. Graduated.
Is short and small-framed -- durability could be an issue. Could stand to become a more nuanced route runner. Can be outmuscled in a crowd -- not a go-up-and-get-it guy. Limited run strength. Underpowered blocker. Too often was a non-factor -- was held to one catch or less in five games as a junior. Was not a home-run hitter in the return game. Split his time with basketball.
Bursts off the line. Eliminates cushion and threatens vertically. Field-fast -- accelerates in a hurry and turns over a fluid stride. Highly athletic. Excellent balance and agility. Gets in and out of cuts quickly. Good hands. Can turn a short throw into a long gain. Is not afraid to work the middle and take a hit to make a play. Tough and competitive. Has traits to be considered as a kick returner. Highly respected with special intangibles -- leads by example and is smart, determined and hardworking.
Rounds 3-4
A two-sport athlete who has already graduated, --NAME-- opted to forgo basketball and his senior football season to enter the draft. While he lacks desirable height and might not be an elite tester, --NAME-- brings explosiveness, hands and playmaking ability to the slot. Arrow is pointing up, and his desirable intangibles inspire confidence he'll reach his potential, especially now that he's able to focus on football.
-------------------------
Aaron_Lynch 2543650 150
Highly recruited Florida prep. Began his college career at Notre Dame -- played 12 games as a true freshman in 2011, starting six at defensive end, and recorded 33 tackles, seven tackles for loss and 5.5 sacks with two passes batted and one forced fumble. Left the team during spring practice in 2012, expressing an interest to play closer to home, and transferred to South Florida. Was forced to sit out that season after his transfer waiver was denied by the NCAA. In his lone season with South Florida, he tallied 29 tackles, 11.5 tackles for loss and five sacks with one pass batted in 12 games (10 starts) in 2013. Had a 44-yard fumble return for touchdown against Connecticut. Weight has fluctuated heavily, which he reportedly said stems from his use of Adderall. Did not work out at the combine because of a right hamstring injury (medical exclusion).
Classic underachiever. Questionable effort, motor and desire. Leaves production on the field. Does not play with passion and lacks urgency. Goes through the motions. Is not a strong or creative rusher and does not create plays. Lacks concentration and focus. Will require maintenance. Weight has fluctuated a lot. Managed just 18 bench-press reps at the combine. Did not show well at his pro day -- managed a 29-inch vertical and recorded poor times in the three-cone drill (7.46 seconds) and short shuttle (4.61 seconds).
Outstanding size and body length. Flashes some playmaking ability. Deceptive strength to leverage the edge. Has a giant wingspan and can corral ball carriers.
Rounds 5-6
A big, athletic prospect who displayed the most potential as a freshman at Notre Dame. Has underachieved since transferring closer to home and shedding considerable weight. Must prove motivated to reach his potential. Finished the season strong and finally showed signs of the talent he displayed as a standout freshman. Would benefit from a strong, mentoring, veteran position coach, and could land with a team like the Bengals, who have a propensity to gamble on boom-or-bust prospects, especially in the mid to late rounds, when reward outweighs risk.
-------------------------
Khyri_Thornton 2543653 85
Played defensive tackle and fullback as a Florida prep. Attended Hargrave Military Academy in Virginia for one year.

In the Golden Eagles' home finale Nov. 23 against Middle Tennessee, he suffered a deep bone bruise to his right leg that caused some internal bleeding and was not able to play the following week. Team captain.
Has short arms and small hands. Could do a better job working off blocks, creating separation and protecting his legs. Tends to wear down and tire late in games and effort wanes. Needs to develop more pass-rush moves -- stays blocked too long. Relies too much on his upper-body strength. Can be late to locate the ball and needs to do a better job of feeling blocking pressure and anticipating. Misses a lot of tackles. Minimal sack production.
Flashes shock in his hands. Solid anchor strength. Versatile and lines up all along the front. Flashes speed and short-area burst to flatten down the line and close to the ball. Three-year starter.
Rounds 5-6
Has the size, brute strength and enough agility to warrant interest as a developmental, rotational five-technique in an aggressize, zone-blitzing scheme such as the Jets, Ravens or Steelers. Versatility is a plus.
-------------------------
Cameron_Fleming 2543654 140
Also lettered in basketball as a Texas prep. Redshirted in 2010. Started all 11 games played at right tackle in 2011; did not play against Oregon or Oregon State (ankle). Started all 28 games at right tackle from 2012 to 2013.
Thick, tight hips. Needs to improve footwork. Can be impatient in pass protection. Tends to bend at the waist. Could be stressed by quicker rushers. Average sustain. Does not generate power through his core. Balance and coordination wanes on the second level -- struggles connecting with moving targets. Does not consistently block through the whistle and could become a better, nastier finisher.
Big body. Strong hands. Can down block and generate movement in the run game. Agile enough to run out of his kick-slide and push rushers wide. Shows alertness and reactions to combo block and pass off stunts. Three-year starter in a pro-style offense. Very intelligent.
Rounds 3-4
Big, thickly built, experienced right tackle who graduated with a degree in aeronautics and astronautics and entered the draft early despite standing to benefit from another year of seasoning on The Farm. Has size and smarts to stick in a power/slide-protection scheme, but needs to make strides with his functional strength, technique and aggressiveness. Could be tried inside.
-------------------------
Tyler_Gaffney 2543655 204
His father, Gene, was a pitcher for the University of San Diego in the early 1980s. Was a four-sport athlete as a prep in San Diego, participating in football, baseball, basketball and track.

Amassed 330 rushes for 1,709 yards (5.2) and 21 TDs and 15 catches for 86 yards and a TD in 14 starts. Rushed a school-record 45 times vs. Oregon.
Tight-hipped and straight-linish. Limited twitch and wiggle. Gears down to cut. Average quickness to and through the hole. Runs duck-footed and lacks breakaway speed -- can be tracked down from behind. Has split his time and training between two sports.
Excellent size. Effective inside runner. Nice vision and patience. Runs behind his pads -- churns his legs through contact and fights for extra yards. Good hands as a receiver out of the backfield. Highly competitive. Tough and durable. Well-conditioned athlete -- showed he could handle a heavy workload after a year away from the gridiron (averaged 24 carries per game). Very solid in pass protection. Recorded a 6.78-second three-cone time at the NFL Scouting Combine, finishing second among backs.
Rounds 5-6
--NAME--, who doubles as a baseball player, rejoined the Cardinal football team after a one-year stint in Class A. Did not skip a beat, shouldering the load as a feature back and putting himself back on the NFL radar by showing inside running skills as a big, athletic, downhill back willing to grind out the tough yards. Has the determination and competitiveness to earn a backup role for a power-running team.
-------------------------
Ed_Reynolds 2543656 162
His father, --NAME--, played 135 games at linebacker for the Patriots and Giants from 1983-1992 and went on to work in the NFL central office for 12 years. The Virginia prep also lettered in track, setting a school indoor triple jump record (44 feet, 3 1/3 inches). Enrolled at Stanford in 2010 and appeared in five games as a freshman, recording six tackles. Was slated to be a candidate to start in 2011 but was injured in spring drills when a wide receiver landed on his knee. Had surgery for a torn ACL and missed the campaign. Returned in 2012 and won the starting free safety job, starting all 14 games and recording 47 tackles, five pass breakups and six interceptions. His team-high interception total was the highest by a Stanford player since 1973. Returned a school-record three of those INTs for scores (25 yards against Washington State, 52 yards at Colorado and 71 against Duke). His combined 301 yards on interception returns was the second-highest total in NCAA history (USC's Charles Phillips, 302 in 1974). Appeared in 14 games in 2013 (13 starts) and had 87 tackles, four pass breakups and one INT with one tackle for loss. Was third on the team in tackles. Did not start against Washington State after being ejected the previous week for a targeting infraction. Elected not to run the shuttles or three-cone drill at the combine.
Small hands. Very average play speed, twitch and flexibility. Unsudden change of direction. Lacks burst to close suddenly or recover when beat. Occasionally loses field leverage and takes some inaccurate angles. Leaks yards after contact. Misses too many tackles in the open field and can be run over (see Utah). Can be manipulated by quarterbacks. Limited experience in man coverage. Poor leaping ability. Appeared extremely rigid in positional workout at pro day.
Good size to contend with tight ends. Reads the quarterback and displays good instincts and anticipation. Showed ballhawking skills as a junior. Functional range off the hash. Wrap tackler. Has NFL bloodlines.
Rounds 6-7
Big, assignment-sound, Cover-2 safety who brings a dependability factor but lacks ideal athletic ability and physicality. Is the type you look to replace as a starter, but could have longevity as a backup.
-------------------------
David_Yankey 2543657 145
Born in Sydney, Australia. Prepped in Georgia. Appeared in two games as a true freshman in 2010, but suffered a season-ending injury. Started all 13 games at left guard in 2011. Won the Morris Trophy as the Pac-12's most outstanding offensive lineman in 2012, when he started all 14 games at left tackle.

Missed the Washington game after his father, --NAME--, died of cardiac arrest. Team captain.
Average hip snap. Does not roll off the ball and overpower defenders. Stiff, lumbering movement. Needs to improve contact balance, particularly on the move. Tends to get out over his skis and slip off blocks. Could struggle to corral quicker interior defenders -- lacks ideal athleticism, lateral suddenness and recovery ability.
Very good size. Has sheer mass to lean, wall off or cover up defenders. Solid base in pass protection -- gets his hands on rushers, anchors and slides to fan pressure. Effective short puller. Durable three-year starter. Has played guard and tackle. Smart and dependable.
Rounds 2-3
Big, physical, smart, serviceable offensive guard who will not score many style points, but generally gets the job done. Has starter-caliber ability and fits best in a power scheme that takes advantage of his size and pulling ability.
-------------------------
Terrance_West 2543664 94
The Baltimore prep was a multi-sport athlete, participating in basketball, baseball and track in addition to football. Spent the 2010 season at Fork Union Military Academy (Virginia) after difficulty qualifying because of his SAT score. Burst onto the collegiate scene in 2011 by winning the Jerry Rice Award (top freshman in FCS) and ECAC Offensive Rookie of the Year after rushing 194 times for 1,294 yards (6.7-yard average) and an FCS-leading 29 touchdowns in 11 games (one start).

Missed the Old Dominion game because of a death in the family. Set the NCAA FCS single-season rushing mark and led all of college football in 2013 with 413 carries for 2,519 yards (6.1) and 41 touchdowns and 26 catches for 258 yards and a TD in 16 games. Was the CAA Offensive Player of the Year and a finalist for the Walter Payton Award. Led the Tigers to the FCS Championship game and set the FCS record for touchdowns in a season with 42. Had 354 yards and five touchdowns against Eastern Illinois in the playoffs. His 84 career rushing touchdowns tied the FCS record, set by Adrian Peterson (Georgia Southern 1998-2001) in only three seasons.
Lacks elite timed speed. Average initial quickness and elusiveness. Tight hips. Can be more cognizant of ball security -- tends to swing the ball away from his body and fumbled five times as a junior. Needs to polish his third-down skills, including route running and pass-protection awareness. Running style and college workload do not lend to longevity -- tread is worn down from 780 carries in three seasons.
Equipped to run between the tackles and withstand a pounding. Good vision -- reads and cuts off blocks. Runs with attitude and power -- stays behind his pads, churns out yards after contact and finishes runs. Opens up his stride in space and has competitive speed to break long runs. Rare production. Bore a heavy workload and thrived with a lather. Has a nose for the goal line -- 83 rushing TDs in three seasons.
Rounds 3-4
Good-sized, compactly built, highly productive, physical workhorse and program-changer who took Towson to new heights while dominating inferior competition. Has the chops to factor prominently in a power-running scheme, showing the ability to slash and cut, run over defenders and contribute as a receiver.

Xavier_Su'a-Filo 2543666 33
Parade All-American who won three state titles at Provo (Utah) Timpview and was the state's 4A Offensive Player of the Year as a senior. In 2009, was the first true freshman offensive player in UCLA history to start the season opener; started all 13 games at left tackle. Did not play the next two years while serving a two-year LDS mission in Alabama and Florida. Upon returning, started all 14 games at left guard in 2012. Started all 13 games in 2013, including seven at left guard, six at left tackle. Won the Morris Trophy, which is given to the most outstanding offensive lineman in the Pac-12, as voted on by the conference's defensive linemen. Was also voted the Bruins' offensive MVP. Team captain.
Lacks ideal length. Missed two years of strength training while serving a LDS mission and has a bad body. Could stand to play with better pop and power in his hands. Bends at the waist, gets overextended and falls off blocks. Heavy-legged -- slow to shift his weight and adjust to stunts and quick inside moves. Gets beat across his face. Needs to play with better awareness -- gets short-circuited by complicated defensive movement. Struggled mightily at left tackle.
Quick out of his stance. Effective pass blocker -- can bend his knees, extend and mirror in short area. Generates movement in the run game. Can work his hips and maneuver to gain positioning. Good foot athlete. Can pull, trap, combo block and step to the second level. Durable three-year starter. Has played guard and tackle.
Rounds 1-2
Does not look the part and was miscast when forced to play left tackle for the Bruins, but --NAME-- is more effective than he is pretty. Projects best at left guard, where he has starter-caliber ability in a power scheme, though he is athletic enough to appeal to zone teams, too.
-------------------------
Marcus_Martin 2543670 70
Prepped at Crenshaw (Calif.) High, where he won two L.A. City championships. Cracked the lineup as a true freshman in 2011, starting the final 10 games at left guard. Started 10 of 12 games at left guard in 2012. Moved to center in 2013 and started all 13 games played. Dislocated his left kneecap and sustained a high left ankle sprain against UCLA, knocking him out of the Las Vegas Bowl against Fresno State. Team captain. Did not perform at the combine because of left knee injury (medical exclusion).
A bit knock-kneed and pigeon-toed with herky-jerky movement. Soft puncher. Gets top-heavy and bends at the waist. Average initial quickness, balance and sustain. Ordinary hip snap -- power element missing. Limited lateral agility and recovery ability. Struggles to connect with moving targets. Is not a strong finisher or an aggressive go-getter. Does not dominate the way he is capable. Only bench pressed 225 pounds 23 times at the combine.
Thick and wide-bodied. Walls off and seals defenders. Can work his hips to maneuver and seal. Athletic enough to step to the second level. Plays with his head on a swivel. Good anchor ability in pass protection -- can dig his cleats in the ground vs. big-bodied pluggers and match size with size. Three-year starter with experience at guard and center. Was a 20-year-old junior.
Rounds 2-3
Outstanding-sized, barrel-chested finesse pivot with center-guard versatility. Grades out highly as a position-sustain blocker and possesses untappped strength and power in his body. Lacks desirable grit, toughness and finishing strength to maximize his talent and is stronger than he plays. Has instant-starter potential as a center or right guard, but could stand to benefit from some time to be groomed.
-------------------------
Trevor_Reilly 2543676 233
Married with two daughters. His younger daughter, Shayn, was diagnosed with kidney cancer just before the 2013 season. --NAME-- was a high school linebacker-tight end who also played basketball and volleyball as a prep.

Team captain. Was a medical exclusion at the combine (right knee).
Average athletic ability and lateral agility. Can be stymied by power. Stiff-hipped and robotic moving in reverse. Has limitations in man coverage and can be mismatched by athletic tight ends. Wore a brace on his right knee and plant strength did not appear at full strength. Had arthroscopic surgery on the knee following the season and will require closer medical evaluation. Overaged -- will be a 26-year-old rookie. Really labored in positional workout at his pro day, not showing burst or agility.
Very solidly built frame. Good functional playing strength to beat blocks and defend the run. Very solidly built frame. Good functional playing strength to beat blocks and defend the run. Locates the ball quickly and is around it a lot. Crashes the line hard and plays with energy. Flashes shock in his punch. Fine arm-under move to come underneath blockers and work the edges. Can control and disrupt tight ends. Takes good angles. Solid tackler. Ultra-tough, mentally and physically (played through ACL injury as a junior). Extremely competitive. Very good football intelligence -- can line up a defense. Versatile -- has played every LB position and can interchange with ease. Respected tone-setter. Outstanding work ethic. Identifies with the game. Ultra-competitive.
Rounds 4-5
A country-strong, throwback, wrangler cowboy with the toughness desired to set the edge and the motor, intensity and competitiveness to produce effort sacks. Can factor as a 3-4 rush linebacker in an odd front or match up with tight ends as a strong-side linebacker in an even front. Could contribute readily as a situational rusher and, with continued strength gains, emerge as a DE prospect. Versatility is a plus.
-------------------------
Mo_Alexander 2543677 110
Birth name is Maurice. St. Louis native who also earned all-state recognition in wrestling and track as a prep. Began his college career at Arizona Western College in 2009, playing in 10 games and recording 81 tackles and two interceptions with 17.5 tackles for loss, seven sacks and two forced fumbles. Appeared in 12 games in 2010 and had 98 tackles, four pass breakups and one interception with 19 tackles for loss (for 116 yards), eight sacks and one forced fumble. The 19 tackles for loss ranked second in the NJCAA, and the yards lost total ranked first. --NAME--ved on to Utah State in 2011 and played outside linebacker, appearing in 12 games (eight starts) with 45 tackles, seven tackles for loss, three sacks and one pass breakup. During the off-season, he punched a teammate in the face after a party, and charges were filed (the teammate subsequently underwent emergency surgery). He originally faced a second-degree felony, but he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of aggravated assault resulting in bodily injury, a class A misdemeanor. After initially being ordered to serve a year in jail, the judge suspended all but 45 days of the jail sentence. He was kicked off the team for the 2012 season but was given a second chance, returning in 2013. He started 13 games at free safety, registering 80 tackles, six pass breakups and one interception with nine tackles for loss, 3.5 sacks and two forced fumbles. Missed the Poinsettia Bowl after undergoing wrist surgery, which also prevented him from bench pressing at the combine (medical exclusion).
Miscast in deep coverage. Has man-coverage limitations. Lacks ideal foot speed to adjust to quick slot receivers. Average hands. Inconsistent ball reactions -- in position to make plays, but doesn't. Can be overaggressive and take poor angles. Was kicked off the team and dealt with criminal assault charges for an altercation with a teammate. Very raw understanding of coverages and football concepts.
Explosive, punishing tackler. Very good size and movement skills. Has a 38-inch vertical jump and explosion in his legs. Covers ground fast and is surprisingly loose-hipped for a converted linebacker. Drops into the box and fits in the run game. Physical tackler. Effective blitzer. Aggressive and energetic. Has special-teams experience.
Rounds 4-5
Big, physical, athletic, converted linebacker with very intriguing athletic traits. Was humbled by the loss of football as a junior and made the most of his second chance as a senior. Graded well in his first year in the secondary and solid combine showing helped his draft standing. Possesses the size, aggressiveness, striking ability and movement skill desired at the position, yet will require considerable patience to be groomed.
-------------------------
Antone_Exum 2543680 182
High school defensive back-quarterback who also returned kicks as a Virginia prep. Redshirted in 2009. Saw his first collegiate action in 2010 and played in 14 games, including four starts at free safety and one start at the WHIP linebacker position; had 45 tackles, a team-high nine pass breakups and no interceptions with 1.5 tackles for loss and one forced fumble.

Was named the MVP of the Russell Athletic Bowl, returning an interception 32 yards in the Hokies' victory over Rutgers. Suffered a torn ACL and lateral meniscus of his right knee in a pickup basketball game in January 2013, requiring surgery (performed by Dr. James Andrews). Was unable to participate in off-season workouts and spring drills. After sitting out the first seven weeks of the season, he returned to the field in October and started three games, tallying four tackles, one pass breakup and no INTs. Early in his third start against Miami, he sprained his left ankle and missed the rest of the year.
Average short-area quickness and leaping ability. Technique needs to be coached up. Not natural commanding the back end and making coverage adjustments vs. complex schemes. Likes to do things his own way -- confidence borders on arrogance and could rub some people the wrong way.
Thickly built with defined muscle, a nice wing span and thin ankles. Very good body control and ball skills. Adjusts well in the air. Fluid pedal and movement skill for his size. Very good press strength to hem receivers at the line. Has extensive experience at safety and was used as a gunner and jammer on special teams. Very smart and well-spoken.
Rounds 3-4
Big, strong cornerback with appealing size, field speed and press-coverage ability. Must prove that he can recover from off-season knee surgery and return to being the player he was as a junior.
-------------------------

Had 24 tackles, 10 pass breakups and two interceptions with two tackles for loss, one forced fumble and his first career blocked punt. Team captain.
Could stand to get stronger -- managed just 12 benchpress reps at the Combine. Man-cover limitations. Lacks twitch for the position. Has a choppy pedal and some tightness in transition. Gives up separation at the break point. Average production on the ball. Shows some stiffness when required to break down and tackle in space. Slips off some tackles. Squats on routes and is susceptible to double moves.
Good size and balance. Plays faster than he times thanks to keen instincts, anticipation and route recognition. Zone aware with good eyes, ball reactions and hands to intercept. Outstanding leaping ability. Willing run supporter. Has special-teams experience, including as a gunner and jammer. Tough and durable -- logged 42 career starts. Team captain who understands what it means to be a pro. Was a 21-year-old senior.

-------------------------
Bishop_Sankey 2543682 54
The blue-chip prospect from Spokane, Wash., rushed for 4,355 yards as a prep. Saw action in 12 games in 2011 as a reserve tailback and special teams player, rushing 28 times for 187 yards (6.7-yard average) and one touchdown.

In 2012, started 12 of 13 games (all but season opener) in which he played and produced 289 rushes for 1,439 yards (5.0) and 16 TDs, the third-highest rushing total in UW history. Was the MVP of the Las Vegas Bowl after setting the school's bowl record with 205 yards rushing and 74 yards receiving. In 2013, set the UW single-season marks for rushing yards with 1,870, breaking Corey Dillon's 1996 mark (1,695 yards) and career rushing touchdowns with 37 (Napoleon Kaufman, 34). The Doak Walker Award finalist amassed 327 carries for 1,870 yards (5.7) and 20 TDs and scored a rushing touchdown in each game while averaging 143.8 rushing yards per game and hauling in 28 catches for 304 yards (10.9) and one TD. Team captain.
Shows some hip tightness. Average explosion, finishing speed and elusiveness. Has shown he can be contained by good defenses. Needs to become a more dependable, physical, fundamentally sound pass protector. Can be tracked from behind and too often is grounded by single-tacklers or tripped up by the ankles. Is not a robust tackle-breaker.
Solid, compact built with good thickness through his lower body. Good vision and balance to pick and slide. Subtle lateral agility to pick, slide and accelerate. Reads his blocks and instinctively runs to daylight. Fluid gate and efficient movement. Runs competitively. Good hands to pull in throws off his body. Was productive with a heavy workload in a pro-style offense. Bench pressed 225 pounds 26 times and blazed a 4.0-second 20-yard shuttle time and 6.75-second three-cone time.
Rounds 2-3
The Pac-12's leading rusher, --NAME-- is an instinctive, competitive and shifty, low-to-the-ground hard runner. Can be effective as a complementary zone runner capable of moving the chains and picking up chunk yards.
-------------------------
Austin_Seferian-Jenkins 2543683 38
Highly recruited out of Washington, where he also played basketball in high school. As a true freshman in 2011, started 10 of 13 games and caught 41 balls for 538 yards (13.1-yard average) and six touchdowns. Started all 13 games in 2012 and hauled in 69 passes for 852 yards (12.4) and seven TDs. Was arrested in March 2013 for DUI following a late-night car accident (blood-alcohol level was 0.18); pleaded guilty, paid a $695 fine and was sentenced to 364 days in jail, 363 of which were suspended. Also was suspended for the season opener against Boise State. Broke his right pinkie finger during fall camp and had surgery to insert a pin in the finger. On the season, started all 12 games played and won the Mackey Award -- had 36 catches for 450 yards (12.5) and eight TDs while establishing UW career records for most receptions (146), receiving yards (1,840) and touchdown catches (21) by a tight end. Also played 17 games for the Huskies basketball team as a freshman. Combine examination revealed a stress fracture in his right foot, which required surgery and precluded him from working out. Missed his April 2 pro day because he was still recovering.
Could stand to sculpt his physique and get functionally stronger. Work in progress as an in-line blocker. Not an explosive athlete. Ordinary release. Builds to speed. Tight hips. Does not pop out of breaks. Limited elusiveness after the catch. Receptions and yards fell off by nearly 50 percent as a junior. Character and stability need to be looked into.
Looks the part. Has outstanding size and stature -- presents a big target and dwarfs defensive backs. Uses physicality to create separation and can post up in the red zone. Athletic -- spent time on the UW basketball team. Terrific movement skills and receiving ability for a big man.  Surprising foot speed and agility -- stretches the seam. Adjusts to throws and has soft hands. Has potential to be an effective in-line blocker -- has size and core strength to seal defensive ends.
Rounds 2-3
An intriguing height-weight-speed prospect, --NAME-- has all the tools to be a legitimate Number 1 tight end in the NFL, though he has to maintain focus and consistency and continue improving as a blocker. Has good core strength to develop into a functional, all-around tight end if he learns to get after it in the run game. Suspect quarterback play dipped production as a senior.
-------------------------
Jonathan_Dowling 2543685 247
Was rated as one of the top safeties in the country as a Florida prep. During his senior season, he had 14 interceptions (returning two for touchdowns) and three blocked punts. Also lettered in track. Began his college career at Florida, seeing action in two games as a true freshman in 2010. In November, though, he was kicked off the team in-season by coach Urban Meyer for reportedly not complying with staff and coaches as well as skipping class. Sat out in 2011, transferring to Western Kentucky. Returned to the field in 2012 and immediately made his presence felt, recording 68 tackles, seven pass breakups and six interceptions with 2.5 tackles for loss and two forced fumbles in 12 games (11 starts) at free safety. Scored on a 39-yard interception return against North Texas. Was suspended one game for a hit classified as "flagrant and dangerous," which had earned him an ejection. Started 12 games and had 67 tackles, seven pass breakups and three interceptions with one tackle for loss and an NCAA-leading six forced fumbles in 2013. Returned a blocked field goal 70 yards for a touchdown against Morgan State.
High-cut and lanky for a safety -- durability could be an issue and he needs to add body armor. Gets bullied in the box. Average eyes and instincts. Takes some inaccurate angles. Shoddy tackler with poor fundamentals -- hits too high, ankle-bites low or launches himself and whiffs. Talks too much and shows off-putting body language. Questionable mental toughness. Thinks he's better than he is. Character, maturity and coachability should be looked into.
Has a rangy frame with room for added bulk. Excellent height and long arms to contend in the air and play the pocket. Good hands to snatch interceptions. Nice linear fluidity. Covers ground with long strides -- rangy off the hash to get over the top. Flashes striking ability when his shoulder blows connect. Playmaking ability -- 9 INTs and 8 FFs in last two seasons. Has special-teams experience covering kicks.
Rounds 4-5
Lean, long-levered, smooth-muscled, finesse free safety with speed and range, though he's more interested in hitting than securing tackles. He does not provide dependability desired on the back end.
-------------------------
Ed_Stinson 2543688 160
Has a daughter. Redshirted in 2009. Saw his first college action in 2010, recording 14 tackles, no tackles for loss and no sacks in nine games (two starts). Although he didn't make any starts in 2011, he was a key part of the defensive line rotation for the national champions. Played in all 13 games and had 19 tackles, five tackles for loss and one sack with one pass batted and one forced fumble. Started all 14 games in 2012, tallying 30 tackles, 8.5 tackles for loss and three sacks to help the Crimson Tide repeat as national champs. In 13 starts in 2013, he had 42 tackles, two tackles for loss and 1.5 sacks with one pass blocked. Did not participate at the Senior Bowl or combine (groin).
Average foot speed. Has some stiffness in his body. Plays a bit flat-footed. Not sudden to get off blocks. Limited burst and explosion to reach the outside -- can secure speed backs. Will require some patience absorbing a game plan.
Very good arm and body length. Outstanding strength at the point of attack. Big stout, power base and superb press strength to set the edge and walk blockers back to the quarterback. Very stout vs. the run. Possesses pop and power in his hands and jolts blockers on contact. Plays square to the line and controls blockers with ease. Physical, drive-through tackler. Extremely tough, hardworking and ultra-competitive. Very well-conditioned with outstanding endurance.
Rounds 3-4
Long-framed, long-armed, prototype five-technique capable of kicking inside and manning the nose. Very impressive strength and power. Can play anywhere along a "30" front. An underrated cog in a defense, --NAME-- could play a long time in the league and might never receive his due outside the building.
-------------------------
Kevin_Norwood 2543689 123
Prepped in Mississippi. Redshirted in 2009. Saw very limited action in 13 games in 2010 and caught three balls for 56 yards (18.7-yard average) and a touchdown. Played in 11 games in 2011 and had 11 catches for 190 yards (17.3) and no touchdowns. Sat out against North Texas and Arkansas (right ankle). Played through turf toe in '12 ' started 11-of-13 games played at the 'Z' receiver for the national champs, contributing 29-461-4 (15.9). Sat out versus Western Carolina (precautionary). Started 7-of-12 games played at the 'Z' in '13 and caught 38-568-7 (14.9). Did not play against Colorado State (ankle). Team captain.
Has short arms. Does not pop out of his breaks or create separation with burst and acceleration. Struggles some defeating the jam. Can show more urgency as a blocker in the run game. Breaks few tackles after the catch.
Solid build. Good hands and concentration -- extends outside his frame and makes the difficult catch. Fine route savvy -- sells his routes with stems and nods. Understands how to get open. Good sideline awareness -- dots the "i." Established rapport with the quarterback is noticeable (is the first receiver sought on broken plays) and keeps working to come free. Very solid personal and football character. Trustworthy, accountable and dependable.
Rounds 3-4
Quicker-than-fast possession receiver with trusted hands a quarterback cherishes in critical situations. Could develop into a reliable, third-down option route runner. Is best with free releases in the slot.
-------------------------
Marion_Grice 2543690 201
A Houston-area prep, he wanted to attend Texas A&M, but an unfulfilled academic requirement left him without a four-year option. Accepted an offer to play from Blinn Junior College (Texas). While in high school in 2008, he was charged with misdemeanor assault and criminal mischief when he was part of a group that fired paintball guns at bystanders from a moving truck. Appeared in 10 games for Blinn in 2010 and ran 160 times for 1,169 yards (7.3-yard average) and 17 touchdowns with eight receptions for 90 yards (11.3) and no touchdowns. Was a second-team NJCAA All-America selection in 2011 after totaling 174 rushes for 1,052 yards (6.0) and 16 touchdowns and 14 catches for 171 yards and two touchdowns, earning him an invitation from Arizona State. Despite not starting any games for ASU in 2012, he scored 11 rushing touchdowns and led FBS running backs with eight receiving TDs. Rushed 103 times for 679 yards (6.6) and 11 touchdowns and caught 41 passes for 425 yards and eight touchdowns. In late December, a close friend of --NAME-- was reportedly shot and killed over a new pair of Air Jordans; eight days later, --NAME-- returned to the Sun Devils for their Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl appearance against Navy and was named the game's MVP, rushing 14 times for 159 yards and two touchdowns. Was a Hornung Award Finalist in 2013, totaling 191 carries for 996 yards and 14 touchdowns and 50 catches for 438 yards and six touchdowns; he also returned 21 kickoffs for 507 yards and no touchdowns (was the only player in the country to surpass the 400-yard mark in each of those categories). Averaged 176.5 all-purpose yards per game, ranking third in FBS. Missed the final three games with a left leg injury. Had 39 touchdowns in his 24-game ASU career and did not lose a fumble in 406 touches.
Has a lean, narrow frame. Needs to bulk up and get stronger. Not equipped to pound between the tackles -- gets tall inside and doesn't push the pile (soft on contact). Weak tackle-breaker who cannot be counted on for yards after contact. Can become a more disciplined route runner. Questionable awareness in pass protection. Statistical production belies inconsistency.
Good balance and body control. Has loose ankles and very good lateral agility. Explosive one-cut ability. Displays vision and elusiveness in the open field. Sees the cutback and weaves in and out of traffic. Has some wiggle to shake tacklers in space. Good receiver -- bursts into routes, adjusts to passes and has soft hands. Fumbled only once the last two seasons. Blue-collar work ethic. Solid character.
Rounds 6-7
Fluid perimeter runner/receiver with playmaking ability, though his game is rough around the edges, requiring more polish and attention to detail. Profiles as a third-down/change-of-pace back, but his football intelligence has to catch up with his physical gifts in order to earn trust he can handle the role.
-------------------------
Will_Sutton 2543691 82
His father, Mickey, was a defensive back/punt returner with the Rams, Packers and Bills from 1986-1990. --NAME-- prepped in California. Saw action in 12 games (two starts) as a true freshman in 2009, recording 17 tackles, three tackles for loss and one sack with one forced fumble. Was academically ineligible in 2010. In his return to the gridiron in 2011, he appeared in all 13 games (12 starts) and had 33 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss and 2.5 sacks with one pass batted. In 2012, tallied 64 tackles, 23.5 tackles for loss and 13 sacks with five passes batted and three forced fumbles in 12 games (11 starts). Missed one game with a toe injury. Started all 14 games in 2013 and had 48 tackles, 13.5 tackles for loss and four sacks with three passes batted and one interception. Back-to-back Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year. Team captain.
Short. Questionable competitiveness and desire. Motor runs hot and cold. --NAME-- disappear for stretches. Has some underachiever traits, and work ethic has a lot of area for improvement. Average strength at the point of attack. Can be turned and rooted out of the hole by the double team. Can improve hand use and develop more of a pass-rush arsenal. Poor timed speed.
Very good athlete. Good body control and balance. Feels blocking pressure and finds the ball quickly. Effective spin move. Shoots gaps and makes plays behind the line. Flattens down the line and can range to the sideline. Strong tackler and athletic enough to string down backs in space. Outstanding career sack production (20.5) from the interior.
Rounds 4-5
Bulked up and added a lot of bad weight as a senior, negating his initial burst and diminishing his production, yet still showed good quickness off the ball. Played at a more natural weight and was noticeably a step quicker in 2012. Fits best as an under tackle in an even front and would be best playing close to 290 pounds. Would benefit tremendously from a disciplined nutrition regimen.
-------------------------
Chris_Smith 2543692 159
Was a top defensive recruit as a North Carolina prep, helping his school to back-to-back state titles and a 30-game winning streak. Enrolled at Arkansas in 2010 and played in six games as a true freshman, recording three tackles and one pass breakup. Appeared in all 13 games (three starts) in 2011 and had 31 tackles, six tackles for losses and 3.5 sacks with one pass batted. Moved into the starting lineup at left defensive end in 2012 and recorded 52 tackles, 13 tackles for loss and 9.5 sacks with four passes batted and one forced fumble. Was arrested in October 2012 after missing a court date for a speeding ticket (64 mph in a 45-mph zone); when he failed to appear, a warrant was issued (he was released on $415 bond). Made 12 starts in 2013 and tallied 36 tackles, 11.5 tackles for loss and 8.5 sacks with one pass batted. Team captain.
Lacks functional playing strength and can be controlled easily when big-bodied blockers get their hands on him (see Alabama). Struggles to split the double team. Not a nuanced pass rusher -- reliant on upfield speed too much. Can do a better job diagnosing the run more quickly and shedding blocks.
Long arms. Very good take-off, burst and closing speed. Wins with quickness and effort. Plays hard with good urgency and runs to the ball. Good finishing speed and hustle in backside pursuit. Gradually improving strength. Likable personality with natural leadership traits. Has a 37-inch vertical jump.
Rounds 3-4
A weakside pass rusher who could most ideally project to the rush linebacker position in the pros for a 3-4 front, --NAME-- graded more highly as a junior than he did as a senior, yet possesses the tools to earn a starting job in the pros in multiple schemes. Versatility is a plus.

Alabama prep who earned all-state honors at linebacker as a senior and at offensive lineman as a junior. Played in the Alabama/Mississippi All-Star Game in 2009. Recorded a 440-pound bench press and 590-pound squat in high school. Began his college career at Illinois, where he made the transition to fullback by upping his weight from 245 to 255 while dropping his body fat from 11 percent to 9 percent. Played in 13 games (seven starts) for the Illini as a true freshman in 2010, including a start in the season opener. Touched the ball once all year, on a 1-yard reception. Was the primary fullback and a key special teams player in 2011, appearing in 12 games (five starts) and rushing twice for 9 yards (4.5-yard average) and no touchdowns while recording 11 special-teams tackles. Did not play in the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl because of a staph infection in his left knee. After the season, he obtained an NCAA waiver to transfer to Auburn in order to be close to home; his mother, Iris, had been diagnosed with a terminal form of brain cancer (she died in September 2012). Was Auburn's main fullback in 2012, appearing in all 12 games (seven starts) with 12 carries for 38 yards and two touchdowns and five catches for 19 yards and no touchdowns. Played in 14 games in 2013, including 11 starts at H-back, but did not have any rushing attempts. Had five catches for 95 yards and a touchdown, including a 56-yard reception vs. Texas A&M. Was a starter on three special-teams units despite breaking a thumb during the season.
Robotic, overly muscled, tightly wound mover. Has very short arms and struggles to lock on and sustain on the move. Marginal elusiveness -- gears down to cut. Unsudden route-runner. Limited receiving production/touches.
Exceptional weight-room strength. Outstanding peripheral blocking vision -- scans wide and locates. Generates power through his lower body and drives defenders out of the hole. Very good hip roll and explosion. Runs his feet on contact. Intense, determined competitor. Good finisher. Is fairly light on his feet for such a big, strong player. Can create a surge in short-yardage situations and power through the line. Catches the ball easily. Core special-teams performer. Outstanding personal and football character -- highly respected team leader. Versatility is a big plus. Very durable.
Round 7-Priority free agent
An old-school fullback with explosive power to pave the way as an iso-lead blocker and enough speed and athletic ability to carve a niche as a core special-teams performer. Valuable pass protector with good hands and short-yardage running power to contribute when needed.
-------------------------
Ahmad_Dixon 2543696 248
Highly recruited Texas prep who also lettered in track, advancing to the state meet as part of the 4x400-meter relay team as a sophomore. Appeared in 11 games as a true freshman in 2010, seeing action as a backup safety and on special teams. Recorded 16 tackles and one forced fumble. Missed two games with an undisclosed injury. Moved into a starting role in 2011, starting 13 times at the hybrid nickelback position and registering 89 tackles, three pass breakups and one interception with 5.5 tackles for loss. Made the switch from safety to nickelback during spring drills. Returned his first career interception 55 yards for a touchdown against Rice. In 2012, he started all 13 games at the nickel position and had 102 tackles, three pass breakups and two interceptions with 5.5 tackles for loss and one sack. In 2013, tallied 81 tackles, six pass breakups and one interception with two tackles for loss in 13 games (12 starts). Had 11 starts at safety and one at nickelback. His one missed start was a result of a targeting penalty against TCU, forcing him to the sideline for the first half of the ensuing game vs. Texas. Was arrested on misdemeanor assault charges in September, but was subsequently cleared by a grand jury.
Very tight in the hips. Straight-linish. Pedals tall and is late transitioning. Average recovery speed. Limited cover skills and awareness. Marginal ball skills and small, shaky hands (four career INTs in three seasons as a starter). Very average football IQ; takes an extra tick to sort out routes and digest what he sees. Narrow vision. Limited agility and change of direction in man coverage. See-and-go reactor -- not instant or anticipatory diagnosing. Not a forceful tackler or explosive hitter. Posted worst vertical jump (32 inches), broad jump (9 feet, 2 inches) and three-cone drill (7.55 seconds) among defensive backs at the combine. Cleared of charges, but September assault incident requires closer look.
Very good size and straight-line speed. Is aggressive stepping downhill and supporting the run. Closes fast to the ball. Secure, wrap tackler. Takes efficient angles and is a reliable last line of defense. Good backside chase pursuit. Solid special-teams potential.
Rounds 6-7
Box safety possessing the physical talent to compete in the NFL and even earn a starting job eventually if he can stay focused, commit to a playbook and hone his eyes. Should be able to factor readily on special teams. Coverage limitations will leave him vulnerable and would be best in a very simple scheme.
-------------------------
Cyril_Richardson 2543697 153
New Orleans native who moved to Texas after Hurricane Katrina. Redshirted in 2009. Played 12 games in 2010, starting four at left guard. Did not play against Texas. Moved to left tackle in 2011 and started all 13 games, grading out at 80.8 percent with 70 knockdowns. Started 12 of 13 games at left guard in 2012, grading out at 89.8 percent with 105 knockdowns. Lone non-start was against Kansas when he was suspended for the first half by the Big 12 for kicking an Iowa State player in the groin. Was an Outland Trophy finalist in 2013, when he started all 13 games at left guard, grading out at 89 percent with 89 knockdowns. Was the Big 12 Offensive Lineman of the Year (coaches) his final two seasons.
Bad body -- has a fleshy midsection and could stand to shed some bad weight. Lateral agility and recovery quickness are just adequate. Gets in trouble when his feet stall or he bends at the waist (slips off blocks). Intermittent intensity. Does not play violently or impose his will physically as often as he should. Could stand to become more of a nasty finisher. Has underachiever traits. Questionable motivation and passion for the game.
Outstanding size and girth with legitimate NFL strength. Sturdy base and heavy anchor -- squats a small house and is dependable in pass protection. Generates movement in the run game. Can work his hips and gain positioning. Walls off and seals. Packs a jolting punch and plays with a load in his hands -- latches on, controls and steers. Wins in a phone booth and can manhandle smaller linemen. Enough balance, coordination and foot speed to pull and trap effectively. Has played tackle and guard. Conditioned in an up-tempo, no-huddle offense.
Rounds 3-4
Massive road grader with enough mass to re-establish the line of scrimmage in the run game. Versatility to play right tackle adds to value, and he has the physical tools to compete readily in a man-blocking scheme if the game is kept simple. Has a bust factor.
-------------------------
Tevin_Reese 2543698 240
Also starred in track as a Texas prep. High school teammate of Lache Seastrunk. Greyshirted in 2009. Worked as an inside receiver for the Bears. Played all 13 games in 2010, starting four, and recorded 45 receptions for 401 yards (8.9-yard average) and no touchdowns. Started 7 of 13 games in 2011 and had 51 catches for 877 yards (17.2) and seven TDs. Played all 13 games in 2012, starting the final 12, and had 53 catches for 957 yards (18.1) and nine TDs. Non-start was season opener against SMU when the Bears began with two tight ends. Started 8 of 9 games played in 2013, managing 38 catches for 867 yards (22.8) and eight TDs before he broke his right wrist against Oklahoma; missed four games and did not start against Central Florida in the Fiesta Bowl. Also had 11 career rushes for 136 yards (12.4) and no touchdowns.
In desperate need of NFL weight training and nutrition -- is rail thin with small hands and weighed the lightest of any combine participant. Can be jammed and re-routed at the line. Questionable toughness to consistently work the middle. Outmuscled in a crowd and struggles to make contested catches. Dabbled in track and is fairly straightlinish. Marginal blocker. Durability is a concern -- has been dinged up and is not built to withstand the physicality of the NFL game.
Boasts freakish athleticism, including rare leaping ability. Explodes off the line. Fast and sudden. Turns over fluid stride with length and frequency. Stretches the field vertically. Tracks and adjusts to throws and displays terrific body control. Catches easily -- snatches throws out of the air. Good short-area quickness. Darts upfield after the catch. Playmaking ability -- averaged 19.4 yards per catch the last three seasons. Paced all receivers at the combine with a 41-inch vertical jump and tied for the longest broad jump at 11 feet.
Rounds 5-6
Thin, underdeveloped, confident, field-fast receiver with soft hands. Was a playmaker in a prolific spread offense. Will have to be a slot receiver, given his dependence on a free release, but does not have an ideal skill set to work inside and could require patience.
-------------------------
Kyle_Van_Noy 2543699 40
Engaged. Raised by adoptive parents. Linebacker-receiver who won a football state championship, ran track and played basketball and baseball as a Nevada prep. Days before 2009 National Signing Day, was arrested for DUI, jeopardizing his scholarship to BYU. When given the opportunity to be released of his commitment and sign elsewhere, he reaffirmed his commitment to BYU and accepted the terms of delayed enrollment, including a full year abiding by the school's honor code and endorsement from an ecclesiastical leader. Also wrote a letter to head coach Bronco Mendenhall, expressing remorse and promising to earn back his trust. A month later, he was reportedly caught with alcohol and cited for eluding police. Charges were eventually dropped, but Van --NAME-- flew to Provo in order to confess to Mendenhall in person, at which time he admitted needing help to straighten out his life. Mendenhall vouched for Van --NAME--, and the school honored his scholarship the following year. Before the 2010 season, he got sick and lost 30 pounds. Played all 13 games in the fall, starting two at strong outside linebacker in BYU's 3-4 scheme, and was credited with 35 tackles, 7.5 for loss and two sacks with two pass breakups and two forced fumbles. Moved to the weak side permanently in 2011, when he started 8 of 13 games and produced 68 tackles, 15 tackles for loss and seven sacks with three pass breakups, three interceptions, three forced fumbles and a blocked kick. Sat out 2012 spring practice while recovering from surgery to repair a torn right labrum. Started all 26 games the next two seasons. Totaled 53 tackles, 22 tackles for loss and 13 sacks with five pass breakups, two interceptions (one touchdown), six forced fumbles and two blocked kicks in 2012. In 2013, he had 70 tackles, 17.5 tackles for loss and four sacks with seven pass breakups, two interceptions and a safety in 2013.
Has short arms. Lacks elite length and flexibility to bend and flatten. Average instincts and diagnose. Still developing eye discipline. Needs to cultivate a more sophisticated arsenal of pass-rush moves. Leaves some production on the field. Leaves his feet to tackle and slips off the ball carrier. Hit-or-miss run defender. Could stand to improve his upper-body strength and stack-and-shed ability. Average motor -- could pursue with more urgency.
Has a muscular, well-proportioned build. Quick get-off. Knifes gaps. Good pass-rush ability -- can push the pocket or pressure the edge. Keeps working to the quarterback and has deceptive closing speed. Eyes the quarterback and tries to get his hands in the passing lane. Athletic with good movement skills in all directions -- equipped to keep pace with backs and tight ends in coverage. Is rangy and can open up his stride and run vertical. Glides on the field. Scheme versatile. Football smart.
Rounds 3-4
Good-sized, athletic, smooth-moving stand-up player who projects best as a 3-4 right outside linebacker, but could also warrant consideration from 4-3 teams as a Will or Sam. Is not without flaws, but has unique ability to play up the field, laterally or in reverse.
-------------------------
Brandon_Thomas 2543702 100
South Carolina native. Tore his ACL as a high school senior in 2008. Redshirted in 2009. Appeared in 10 games as a reserve in 2010. Took over the left guard spot in Week 4 in 2011 and started 10 of 13 games played (nine at left guard, one at left tackle). Yielded start to David Smith against South Carolina. Started all 26 games at left tackle 2012-13. Team captain tallied 98 knockdowns in his career. Tore his ACL while working out for the Saints in April.
Power element missing. Limited hip snap -- not a road-grading mauler. Susceptible to bull rush when he sets tall. Could stand to improve lateral slide and inside punch to shut down strong inside moves. Inconsistent second-level sustain. Is better with simple assignments and effectiveness wanes in space. Can do a better job playing with his head on a swivel. Still learning what it means to prepare like a pro.
Good size with very long arms and big hands. Quick out of his stance. Knee bender with good balance and body control. Solid base. Places his hands inside and can pop and recoil. Strong-handed puncher with good grip strength once he latches on. Athletic, efficient mover. Light on his feet to step to the second level or pull. Can maneuver and throw his hips in the hole. Climbs to the second level. Three-year starter who played tackle (two-time first-team All-ACC at LT). Held his own against Jadeveon Clowney without help.
Round 3
Strong-bodied, dependable gap blocker who played left tackle in college but will likely slide inside in the pros. Showed improvement as a senior and has the potential to be a long-term fixture at left guard. Ability to play tackle in a pinch adds to value.
-------------------------
Tajh_Boyd 2543703 213
Led his Virginia prep team to a 43-2 record and two state titles. Played his senior season with a torn ACL in his left knee. Redshirted in 2009. Made seven appearances in 2010, completing 33 of 63 passes for 329 yards (52.7 percent), four touchdowns and three interceptions and rushing 23 times for 33 yards (1.4-yard average) and one touchdown. Started all 14 contests in 2011, going 298-of-499 (59.7) for 3,828 yards with 33 TDs and 12 INTs while rushing 142 times for 218 yards and five TDs. The ACC Player of the Year made all 13 starts in 2012, going 287-of-427 (67.2) for 3,896 yards with 36 TDs and 13 INTs and rushing 186 times for 514 yards and 10 TDs. Was a finalist for the Johnny Unitas and Manning Awards in 2013 after going 283-of-413 (68.5) for 3,851 yards with 34 TDs and 11 INTs in 13 starts; also had 154 rushes for 400 yards and 10 TDs. Became the first QB in ACC history with 30-plus TD passes in three seasons and set the conference mark with 107 career TD passes. Team captain. Graduated in December. Had a 32-8 mark in 40 career starts for head coach Dabo Swinney's up-tempo, spread offense.
Lacks ideal height, and weight has tended to fluctuate, pushing to nearly 240 the second half of 2011 season. Sails downfield throws and can improve his accuracy. Inconsistent decision-making. Did not take snaps under center in a pistol, read-option offense and production was inflated by an NFL-caliber supporting cast of skill talent. Will require patience adapting to pro-style passing. Needs to quicken his eyes and improve his field vision. Does not always see the deep safety or short-hole defender. Impatient making reads before fleeing the pocket. Durability could be a concern, given his style. Needs to learn to slide.
Sets quickly. Can sling it when he's in rhythm and has a clean pocket. Good zip short-to-intermediate. Can launch deep throws with ease and flashes touch to drop it in the bucket. Shows composure in the face of a blitz and is willing to take a hit to make a play. Makes plays with his feet, rolling the pocket, extending plays or throwing on the move (left or right). Slippery and elusive to escape the rush and is a threat to tuck and run. Functional straight-line speed and run strength for a quarterback; will lower his shoulder on defenders. Experienced, three-year starter. Terrific football character. Has a likable personality.
Rounds 4-5
A short, stocky, fairly nifty, strong-armed quarterback most ideally suited for a vertical-power system. Projects best as a career backup or Number 3 quarterback in the pros and compares very favorably to Ravens 2007 fifth-rounder Troy Smith.
-------------------------
Lorenzo_Taliaferro 2543704 138
The Virginia prep rushed for 1,678 yards and 21 touchdowns as a senior. Spent two seasons at Lackawanna College (Scranton, Pa.), recording 19 carries for 96 yards (5.1-yard average) and one TD and nine receptions for 68 yards (7.6) and one TD in 10 games in 2010. In 10 games in 2011, recorded 76 carries for 431 yards (5.7) and three TDs and 12 catches for 193 yards and four TDs; also had 22 kickoff returns for 579 yards (26.3) and a TD. Moved to Coastal Carolina for the 2012 season and saw action in 12 games (three starts), posting 80 carries for 357 yards (4.5) and four TDs and four catches for 38 yards and no TDs. Missed the season opener against North Carolina A&T with an undisclosed injury. Had a monster 2013 campaign, earning Big South Offensive Player of the Year honors after leading the conference with 1,729 yards on 276 carries (6.3) and 27 TDs in 15 starts. He added 23 catches for 153 yards and two TDs. The Walter Payton Award finalist set 11 school records and five conference rushing marks. Team captain.
Has very small hands. Limited speed and burst to the perimeter. Monotone runner who takes time to get rolling downhill. Much of his production is blocked for him. Plays in a spread offense where he is usually moving laterally at the snap and not stepping downhill. Stiff route runner. Regularly matched up against lesser competition.
Outstanding size. Very good production. Is patient and follows his blocks. Finds creases and is adept navigating through traffic without losing speed -- good eyes. Nice spin move. Competes hard. Strong short-yardage producer. Runs hard and usually falls forward. Catches outside his frame. Helps chip in pass protection and is alert to see the blitz. Good football intelligence and awareness.
Rounds 5-6
A big, small-school producer with a solid all-around skill set to compete for a job as a role player in a zone scheme. Will need to contribute on special teams to earn a spot.
-------------------------
Weston_Richburg 2543705 43
Also played basketball and threw the discus as a Texas prep. Tore his right ACL in high school and did not play his sophomore and junior seasons. Redshirted in 2009. Started all 12 games in 2010 (first three at strongside guard, final nine at center). Started all 12 games at 2011, including the first nine at center, before breaking a bone in his right (snapping) hand against San Diego State; stayed in the lineup by playing left tackle the next two games and right guard in the final game. Started all 26 games at center 2012-13. Established a school record with 50 career starts. Team captain.
Lacks ideal girth and could be stressed by widebody nose tackles. Average hip snap -- lacks body power to blow defensive tackles off the ball. Lacks elite athleticism to execute reach blocks. Can improve grip strength to better control defenders (average sustain) -- slides off some blocks. Inconsistent contact balance, especially at the second level where he can be more efficient connecting and fitting.
Good snap-and-step quickness. Maneuvers to gain positioning. Good mobility -- gets out of the chute quickly as a puller and demonstrates nice body control. Good awareness. Energetic and aggressive temperament. Durable, 49-game starter. Vocal team leader with outstanding intangibles.
Rounds 3-4
Adequate-sized, smart, experienced, competitive center who commanded the offensive line, made all the calls and was a team leader for the Rams. At worst, should stick as a backup, but has developmental value and starter potential in a zone scheme. Could help himself by proving versatile enough to back up at guard.
-------------------------
Shamar_Stephen 2543706 220
His last name is pronounced "STEF-an." The defensive lineman also lettered in basketball as a New York prep. Redshirted in 2009. Made his college debut in '10 and was a regular member of the defensive front all year, recording 27 tackles, four tackles for loss and two sacks in 12 games (eight starts). Appeared in all 11 games in '11 and recorded 17-1-0 with one pass batted. In '12, he sprained his right MCL during preseason drills and missed two games. After returning from the injury, he played in 10 games (nine starts) and totaled 26-2-0 with four passes batted. Underwent surgery after the season to clean up a right shoulder labrum issue. In '13, he started all 12 games at defensive tackle and tallied 60-10-3 with one pass batted and one blocked kick. Team captain.
Lethargic get-off. Average eyes, instincts and recognition (doesn't sense screen). Needs to go to school on blocking schemes and learn to fight pressure. Could stand to play with more violence in his hands -- feels his way through plays instead of imposing force. Linear, vanilla rusher (just five career sacks). Moved by double teams. Compete level leaves something to be desired. Disappears for stretches.
Terrific size. Very athletic for a big man. Generally plays on his feet. Occupies blocks. Flashes the ability to lock out and reestablish the line of scrimmage. Has raw tools to work with. Scheme versatile. Solid personal and football character.
Round 3
Big, athletic, raw interior defender with underachiever traits who had a fairly nondescript career at UConn, but has crude physical tools for a defensive line coach to mold. Developmental prospect who potentially fits in a 4-3 or as a 3-4 five-technique.
-------------------------
Jaylen_Watkins 2543707 101
Brother, Sammy, was a star receiver at Clemson and projects as a top-10 pick. --NAME-- was a highly recruited Florida native who ran track in addition to playing cornerback and quarterback. Had surgery on his left quadriceps in April 2010. Appeared in 10 games as a true freshman in the fall, mostly as a gunner on punt returns, and recorded eight tackles, one pass breakup and zero interceptions. Missed spring practice in '11 after hernia surgery before posting 34-5-0 with one tackle for loss in 13 games (eight starts, including the last six) during the fall. Started 11-of-13 games at CB in '12 and tallied 39-8-3 with one tackle for loss. Returned his first career interception 26 yards for a score against Kentucky. In '13, registered 52-7-0 with two tackles for loss in 12 games -- made six starts at safety and three at CB. Hurt his right Achilles at the Senior Bowl, and did not do positional drills at the NFL Scouting Combine (medical exclusion).
Thin-framed, small-boned and short-armed with minimal muscular development. Lacks ideal size and strength for a safety and quickness and burst for a corner. Average press strength to re-route receivers. Allows separation at break points -- late to transition out of his pedal. Too grabby. Selective hitter -- shows up in spurts. Not a physical tackler. Tends to propel his shoulder into ball carriers and needs to do a better job securing tackles.
Nice size and strength for a cornerback (22 bench-press reps at the combine). Excellent speed. Good fluidity and movement skills. Alert in zones. Flashes some playmaking ability. Versatile -- lined up as a corner, safety and nickel defender and played on all special teams.
Rounds 3-4
A fluid, loose-hipped, versatile cover man who projects to a Number 3 or Number 4 corner in the pros, --NAME-- could most ideally fit in the slot, with enough physicality to defend the run and fine short-area cover skills to match up with shifty receivers.
-------------------------
Jon_Halapio 2543708 179
Two-way lineman as a Florida prep. Appeared in three games in 2009, but hurt his shoulder and was granted a medical redshirt. Started 7-of-12 games played at right guard in '10 when he split starts with Maurice Hurt. Did not play against Mississippi State (broken finger). Started all 26 games at RG 2011-12. Missed '13 spring practice (meniscus), then tore pectoral muscle in July -- sat out the first two games before starting the final 10 at RG (reportedly played through an 80 percent pectoral tear). Suffered an eye injury requiring stitches against Tennessee. Team captain.
Tightly wound -- struggles reacting to movement, changing direction and recovering. Does not generate power through his hips. Poor contact balance. Empties the chamber with initial punch and cannot recoil. Hands and feet do not work in unison. Opens the gate in pass protection. Unsudden to clear his feet and pull. Limited blocking range. Tied for the lowest vertical jump (21 1/2) of any offensive lineman at the combine.
Naturally thick with big hands. Can drive block and is effective when he has an angle. Functional anchor. Provides adequate three-step drop protection. Has a warrior's mentality -- plays hurt. Made 43 career starts.
7-Priority free agent
A hulking short-area guard whose best traits are intangible. Is most effective in a phone booth, but too often looks like he requires max effort to provide adequate blocking. Best chance to stick will be in a slide-protection scheme.
-------------------------
Telvin_Smith 2543711 144
Prepped in Georgia, where he won a state championship. Appeared in all 14 games as a true freshman in 2010, recording 18 tackles, three for loss and three sacks with a pass breakup. Played 13 games in '11, starting one at weakside linebacker as an injury replacement, and tallied 42-8.5-3 with three pass breakups, an interception and a forced fumble. Served a one-game suspension against Charleston Southern (undisclosed). Did not crack the starting lineup in '12, but split time with middle linebacker Vince Williams and contributed 64-9.5-1 with three pass breakups and a forced fumble in 14 games. Was the Seminoles' leading tackler in '13 when he started all 14 games at WLB and registered 9-9.5-2 with four pass breakups and three interceptions (two touchdowns) for the national champs. Did not bench-press at the combine (right shoulder).
Despite contributing immediately in college, has been only a one-year full-time starter. Wiry and needs to add bulk to his narrow frame to withstand the rigors of NFL contact -- is almost built like a free safety. Is not a strong, drive-through tackler -- tends to go low. Average hand use and play strength. Could struggle matching up with bigger, more physical tight ends.
Fiery on-field emotional leader. Plays with passion and it shows -- beelines to the ball and brings energy to the defense. Very good eyes, anticipation and instincts -- sniffs out screens, takes good cut-off angles and negotiates through traffic easily. Plays downhill and often arrives behind the line of scrimmage before ball carriers see him. Outstanding functional football-playing speed. Fluid mover. Outstanding closing speed to the ball. Reliable open-field tackler -- runs through contact. Good coverage skill -- shadows receivers and has a feel for zones. Very likeable, gregarious personality that can unite a locker room and command the LB group. Has been very durable (despite lack of thickness). Has learned what it means to work, and football comes easy to him.
Rounds 4-5
A fast-flowing, instinctive, run-and-hit weakside linebacker capable of producing at a high level if he can bulk up and withstand the rigors of the NFL. Has All-Pro potential in a scheme such as the Buccaneers or Cowboys.
-------------------------
Terrence_Brooks 2543712 79
Was a two-way player as a Florida prep, playing cornerback, wide receiver and running back. Appeared in 10 games as a true freshman 2010, recording two tackles, one pass breakup and zero interceptions as a backup cornerback and special-teams player. Did not play in four games (coach's decision). Served as FSU's dime defender in '11, recording 17-5-1 with one-half tackle for loss in 11 games. Recorded his first career interception against Notre Dame, picking off a pass in the end zone to clinch the Champs Sports Bowl. Missed two contests (coach's decision). After spending two years in a reserve role, he started all 14 games at free safety in '12 and had 51-4-2 with one tackle for loss and one forced fumble. Started 13 games for the '13 national champions (five at free safety, eight at strong safety), registering 56-5-2 with eight tackles for loss, one sack and two forced fumbles. Missed the Wake Forest game because of a concussion and left the Miami game at halftime for the same reason.
Could stand to bulk up and get stronger. Inconsistent tackler -- arrives out of control, does not always see what he hits and will miss some tackles seeking the knockout blow. Is built like a cornerback, sustained a concussion as a senior and durability could be an issue given his aggressive playing style. Minimal production on the ball -- was not a playmaker. Has average hands and leaves some INTs on the field. Poor short-shuttle time (7.35 seconds) at the combine.
Fluid and flexible. Pedals and transitions smoothly. Has cornerback speed -- plays fast and covers ground. Has a 38-inch vertical jump. Patrols zones with awareness and anticipation to react to threats. Keys quickly, trusts his eyes and does not hesitate. Aggressive in run support -- swoops down with urgency, runs the alley and plays with abandon. Dependable makeup -- solid character. Tough and durable. Has ability and mentality to contribute on special teams.
Rounds 3-4
Lean, athletic, confident, competitive hybrid safety who should be a solid backup and core special-teams player at a minimum given his combination of fluidity, range and physicality. Has starter-caliber ability if he can improve his ball skills, and offers versatility as a "robber" or box defender.
-------------------------
Arthur_Lynch 2543714 155
Highly recruited TE/DE who migrated from Massachusetts. As a true freshman in 2009, appeared in 11 games (one start) and recorded two catches for 17 yards (8.5-yard average) and zero touchdowns. Was redshirted in '10 in order to preserve a year of eligibility. Was used exclusively as a blocker in '11 when he played all 14 games (one start). Started 13-of-14 games in '12 and contributed 24-431-3 (18.0). Started 11-of-12 games in '13 and caught 30-459-5 (15.3). Bruised his ribs against Florida and sat out against Appalachian State. Team captain.
Needs to develop more finishing strength -- not yet ready to match physically 1-on-1 with NFL defensive ends. Can improve his base and leverage. Average quickness off the line. Pedestrian foot speed. Tight hips. Unsudden -- cannot separate. Shaky hands (too many drops). Needs to improve his route running. Straight-linish after the catch. Thinks he's better than he is. Will be a 24-year-old rookie.
Good size. Functional short-to-intermediate target. Can adjust to throws and extend to catch. Strong and competitive after the catch. Willing to engage and compete as an in-line blocker. Has special-teams experience. Hardworking and football smart. Tough and durable.
Round 7-Priority free agent
Big, competitive, inconsistent tight end lacking special traits for the NFL game. Will have to dedicate himself as a blocker to have a chance to stick as a Number 3.

Rushed for 316 yards against Central Arkansas, the second-highest single-game total in school history (Adrian Peterson, 333 in 1999).

Missed a late-season game with an ankle injury. Concluded his college career with 3,899 rushing yards, the third-highest total in school annals.
On the short side. Runs a bit upright and hesitant. Average burst to the perimeter. Not a creative, make-you-miss runner. Very limited career receiving production (10 career catches). Not stout in pass protection.
Very good athlete. Outstanding weight-room strength -- bench-presses twice his weight and squats three times his weight. Tough runner -- slams hard inside and usually falls forward. Good versatility. Superb worker. Efficient cut blocker. Led all backs at the combine with 32 bench-press reps. Has a 40 1/2-inch vertical jump.
Rounds 3-4
Adjusted from a triple-option quarterbacking role as a junior to a tailback role as a senior and possesses the athletic ability to warrant a chance as a change-of-pace back in the pros. Could even be tried as a return man and cornerback, where he began his college career. Would benefit from focusing on one position and will require some time to develop. Displays some similarities to Chicago Bears 1999 fifth-round pick Jerry Azumah.
-------------------------
Lavelle_Westbrooks 2543716 252
Also competed in long-jump and triple-jump as a Georgia prep. Appeared in 13 games with seven starts as a true freshman in 2010, posting 32 tackles, three pass breakups and two interceptions with three tackles for loss and one sack.

Made 10 starts in '13 and logged 32-7-2 with one tackle for loss and one sack and didn't play in season finale win at Florida (undisclosed injury).
Size is just adequate. Not an explosive athlete. Short-area quickness is lacking. Green instincts. Loses phase in transition. Average production on the ball. Faced marginal competition and could struggle adjusting to the speed of the pro game.
Nice arm length and press strength. Efficient pedal. Good plant and drive. Aggressive jumping routes when he sees it. Functional in run support -- leverages the field and takes good angles. Good closing speed. Solid, face-up tackler.
Rounds 6-7
Adequate-sized, shuffle-and-bail corner who shed weight to convert from safety to cornerback. Has length and moldable tools, but will require patience.
-------------------------
Jeremiah_Attaochu 2543717 50
Born in Nigeria. Went to high school in Washington D.C. Played his first three seasons as a 3-4 outside linebacker for defensive coordinator Al Groh. As a true freshman in 2010, played 12 games (started Independence Bowl against Air Force) and recorded 23 tackles, four for loss and three sacks. Did not play against Wake Forest (groin).

Owns Georgia Tech's career sacks record with 31.5, which ranks fifth in ACC history behind Chris Slade, Reinard Wilson, Peter Boulware and Greg Ellis. Did not work out at the combine because of a left finger injury (medical exclusion)
Needs to get stronger (opted not to bench at pro-day workout). Gets knocked around at the point of attack. Controlled by larger blockers when they get their hands on him. Still developing pop and violence in his hands. Still learning to incorporate power into his rush (more effortful than powerful). Needs to cultivate his pass-rush arsenal. Marginal 20-yard shuttle time (4.68 seconds), indicating tight hips.
Good burst off the snap. Heats up the edge and runs the arc. Quick inside move. Disruptive ability. Motor runs hot -- keeps coming after the quarterback and chases hard from the back side. Moves well laterally and can zone drop. Has experience in even and odd fronts, having played defensive end and stand-up linebacker. Power-leverage potential. Mature and intelligent. Cares about the game and prepares like a pro. Arrow pointing up (will be a 21-year-old rookie). Ran extremely well and registered a 37 1/2-inch vertical jump at his pro day.
Rounds 2-3
--NAME-- is a young, heady, disruptive, relentless edge rusher who profiles as a 3-4 right outside linebacker. Interviewed well and has the look of a trustworthy, long-term starter given his pass-rush ability, motor and makeup. Needs to get stronger, but impressive display of speed, athletic ability and explosion will enhance draft standing.
-------------------------
Christian_Kirksey 2543720 71
Linebacker-fullback who won state titles in football and track as a Missouri prep. Saw limited action in 11 games in 2010, scratching six tackles, zero for loss and zero sacks.

Did not run the 40, shuttles or 3-cone drill at the combine (right hamstring).
Undersized -- lacks ideal length and bulk. Looks like a safety at first glance. Outmuscled at the point of attack -- gets stuck on blocks and covered up. Average eyes and instincts. Needs to be schemed free as a blitzer. Not a playmaker -- just 3.5 sacks and 9.5 TFL in three seasons. Bench-pressed 225 pounds just 16 times, second-fewest among linebackers at the combine.
Agile and athletic. Flows to the ball when he has a clear path. Experience in space and over the slot. Has terrific personal and football character, including leadership traits. Two-time captain. Was a 21-year-old senior. Ran extremely well at his pro-day workout, recording superb sub-4.6-second 40-times and a 36-inch vertical jump.
Rounds 4-5
Small-framed, athletic, finesse, run-around Will linebacker who will have to stand out on special teams to earn a reserve spot.
-------------------------
C.J._Fiedorowicz 2543721 65
Given name is Colton John. Last name is pronounced "feh-DOR-uh-wits." Saw limited action in all 13 games as a true freshman in 2010 and did not record any receiving stats. Played all 13 games in '11, starting five, and caught 16 balls for 167 yards (10.4-yard average) and three touchdowns. Started all 12 games in '12, producing 45-433-1 (9.6). Started 12-of-13 games in '13, snagging 30-299-6 (10.0). Was replaced in the starting lineup by Ray Hamilton against Minnesota. Said head coach Kirk Ferentz: "Ray has been playing well as has --NAME-- It was more a matter of giving Ray an opportunity based on how he has been performing in games and practice."
Has average, build-up speed. Not elusive after the catch. Can improve as a move blocker and develop more of a mean streak to finish blocks. Average production. Could stand to adopt a more blue-collar work ethic when people aren't watching -- is not a self-starter and has been able to cruise on his rare size and natural ability.
Outstanding size and big hands. Carries his weight well. Has size to widen the hole or seal defensive ends. Good balance and body control for his size. Surprising lower-body flexibility to sink his hips to run sharp-angle routes. Has stature and enough speed to threaten the seam. Understands how to use his frame and physicality to create subtle separation. Makes athletic hands catches off his frame. Sizable catch radius. Shows toughness and concentration in traffic. Lowers his shoulder to deliver a blow after the catch. Can line up in-line or split out. Smart and durable.
Rounds 3-4
Big-framed, linear and dependable, --NAME-- looks the part and has balanced skills to be a legitimate 'Y' tight end in the pros. Is an asset as a competitive blocker and as a sure-handed receiver. Draft status could benefit from an average tight end crop.
-------------------------
Walt_Aikens 2543724 125
2013: First-team All-Big South selection. Played in 12 games and started 10. Tied for team lead with 62 tackles. 2012: Second-team All-Big South. Played in all 11 games, starting 10. 2011: Second-team All-Big South. Started in all 11 games. Led conference with three forced fumbles. 2010: Dismissed from Illinois coach Ron Zook after arrest on felony possession of stolen property. Pled guilty to stealing a laptop computer and other electronics from a dormroom.
Is tight-hipped and lacks ideal foot speed, which creates separation in man coverage. Average instincts -- can be late to diagnose run-pass reads and locate the ball, is a tick slow to sort out routes and too easily lured by nods and fakes. Often plays into the boundary. Benefits from facing average competition. Character will require closer examination following dismissal from Illinois after a misdemeanor theft conviction.
Outstanding size. Good press strength. Good athletic ability. Can keep stride with receivers down the field and ride the hip pocket in man coverage. Aggressive tackler (though often shoots low) -- led the team in tackles as a senior and is unafraid to mix it up. Takes on blocks with physicality and attacks the run. Adequate production on the ball. Has gunner experience.
Rounds 6-7
Exceptional-sized, Illinois transfer with enough physicality to function as a short-area, press corner and contribute on special teams.
-------------------------
Marcus_Smith 2543725 26
Played quarterback as a Georgia prep. Converted to linebacker as a true freshman in 2010 -- saw action in nine games (one start) and recorded three tackles, one tackle for loss and zero sacks.

Was the American Athletic Conference's Defensive Player of the Year in '13, starting 13 games and recording 42-18.5-14.5 with three passes batted, four forced fumbles and a blocked kick.
Lacks ideal length -- plays short-armed and can be locked up by larger blockers. Short initial steps. Still crafting a wider array of counters and pass-rush moves. Still learning to convert speed to power. Work in progress as a run defender. Does not set a hard edge and can do a better job using his hands to disengage quicker. Needs to become a more violent hands fighter. Limited experience playing in reverse.
Nice bend, balance and body control. Good pass-rush ability and potential. Quick first step. Coordinated hands and feet. Athletic and agile -- can stunt and loop. Flashes a spin move. Shows burst to close and get home. Moves well laterally. Gives effort in pursuit and ranges all over the field. Operated from 2- and 3-point stance. Solid character. Is coachable and has improved steadily.
Rounds 3-4
A high school quarterback turned pass rusher who broke out with 14.5 sacks as a senior (1.12 sacks-per-game average led nation), --NAME-- projects as a pass-rushing, 3-4 right outside linebacker in the pros. Should contribute initially on passing downs and has eventual starter potential as his game becomes more well-rounded.
-------------------------
Lamin_Barrow 2543727 156
Louisiana native. Redshirted in 2009. Was a backup Will linebacker and special-teams contributor his first two years.

Team captain wore jersey Number 57 prior to his senior season when he was elected to wear Number 18, signifying the player who bests represents what it means to be a Tiger.
Small-framed -- is short and lacks ideal bulk. Lacks elite speed for his size. Average eyes and instincts. Gives ground at the point of attack. Does not play downhill or make enough plays at/behind the line -- too much production is downfield. Leaves production on the field -- in position but does not finish. Overruns plays (loses contain). Sucked in by playaction. Not a striker.
Knee bender. Uses his arms like flippers to ward off blocks on the move. Athletic and agile. Moves well laterally. Can redirect and chase. Drops easily into zone coverage and shows hip swivel and range. Tough and football smart. Highly respected and hardworking team captain. Has special-teams experience and traits. Posted a 35-inch vertical leap and 10-foot, 3-inch broad jump at the combine.
Rounds 4-5
Undersized, athletic, run-around see-and-go reactor who needs to be protected to be effective. Projects as a Will linebacker, nickel defender and special-teams contributor.
-------------------------
Rob_Blanchflower 2543728 230
Tight end-defensive end as a Massachusetts prep. Redshirted in 2009. Played all 11 games in 2010, starting four, and caught 21 balls for 179 yards (8.5-yard average) and three touchdowns. Started 8 of 11 games in '11, catching 18-208-1 (11.6). Started all 10 games played in '12 and tallied 43-464-2 (10.8). Did not play against Western Michigan and Bowling Green State (leg). In '13, started 5-of-6 games played and managed 27-313-3 (11.6), though he was bothered by a bilateral sports hernia injury that prevented him from practicing, sidelined him for six games and medically excluded him from any workouts at the combine. Team captain. Was still recovering from surgery at his pro day and scheduled to work out April 23.
Average athletic ability. Can improve beating the jam. Not a quick or savvy route runner. Rounds out of his breaks and can do a better job selling routes with stems and nods. Creates little separation. Takes what he is given after the catch -- limited creativity and elusiveness. Inconsistent hands. Regularly matched up vs. lesser competition. Will be a 24-year-old rookie.
Outstanding size. Competitive run blocker -- drives his legs and works to finish. Tough. Functional pass protector. Lays out for the ball and will sell out his body to make difficult catches. Good career production -- exits school as career receiving leader for a tight end. Smart. Solid special-teams temperament. Respected leader and two-time team captain. Four-year starter.
Round 7-Priority free agent
A scrappy, tough, competitive 'Y' tight end, --NAME-- was slowed by injury as a senior. However, he possesses the grit to factor in-line in the run game and can become a solid base-blocking Number 3 tight end and short-area receiving option.
-------------------------
Brandon_Linder 2543729 93
Won a state championship at Florida prep power St. Thomas Aquinas. As a true freshman in 2010, played 12 games and had five starts as an extra blocker in UM's "jumbo" personnel package. Started all 12 games at right guard in '11. Was sidelined by a cracked rib during '12 fall camp, but started all 12 games. Missed '13 spring practice with a left PCL sprain. Was the Hurricanes' offensive MVP in the fall, starting all 13 games, including 10 at right guard and three at right tackle.
Adequate athlete. Limited explosion -- cannot overpower defenders. Plays short-armed (average sustain). Tends to lunge and slip off blocks. Body control and contact balance wane in space and on the move. Is late to cut off linebackers and struggles the farther he has to go.
Terrific size. Engages with urgency and works to gain positioning. Can lean and seal. Good hand placement. Functional anchor when his base and posture are technically sound. Ideal makeup to battle in the trenches. Plays with his head on a swivel -- alert to threats. Nasty finisher. Outstanding personal and football character. Smart vocal leader. Tough, durable and experienced (42 career starts).
Rounds 4-5
Big, experienced, highly competitive, short-area base blocker at his best in a phone booth. Lacks ideal power and athleticism, but has football intelligence, leadership traits and a bulldog's mentality. Should earn a spot as an interior backup initially, but brings grit to the line and has the makeup to outplay his draft position.
-------------------------
Seantrel_Henderson 2543730 237
Prepped at St. Paul (Minn.) Cretin-Derham, where he won a state championship and participated in basketball and track field. Was the first lineman to win USA Today's High School Offensive Player of the Year. Also was Parade's Player of the Year as well as the nation's consensus Number 1 offensive tackle recruit, drawing offers from coast to coast. Originally signed with USC, but asked for and was granted his release after the NCAA handed down sanctions stemming from the Reggie Bush investigation. Joined Miami in July '10, starting 9 of 12 games played at right tackle -- did not start the season opener against Florida A&M, did not play against Ohio State and did not start against Pittsburgh. Also did not start the Sun Bowl against Notre Dame (stomach virus). Had offseason sciatic nerve surgery and was suspended for the '11 opener against Maryland -- on the season, started 3 of 8 games played at RT. Was suspended for the beginning of '12 spring practice. Following a funeral, was involved in a car accident and sustained a concussion -- missed the first 12 practices of fall camp and sat out the season opener against Boston College. Played 11 games, starting the final seven at RT. In '13, started 8 of 12 games played at RT. Was suspended against Georgia Tech. Revealed at the Senior Bowl that college suspensions stemmed from failed drug tests.
Weight-room strength is not special given his size. Needs to strengthen his core -- affects body control, contact balance, sustain and finish. Spends too much time on the ground. Technique lapses -- needs to play with more consistent bend and leverage. Gets in trouble when his feet stall and is slow to shift his weight. Labors to execute reach blocks and is stressed by quick inside moves -- occasionally lets defenders cross his face. Struggles adjusting to moving targets in space. Should be more powerful than he is. Uneven performance. Underachiever traits. Suspect maturity, dependability and decision-making -- is easily led astray and was suspended multiple times. Did not endear himself to coaches at pro-day workout.
Looks every bit the part with a rare-sized body that will make offensive line coaches drool -- broad-shouldered, big-boned, well-proportioned and thickly built. Athletic bender. Light-footed kick slide. Is a day trip to get around -- long arms aid recovery and enable him to push rushers wide of the pocket. Thwarts rushers with a heavy punch and sturdy base. Locks on and controls. Walls off and seals. Widens the hole. Gets to the second level with ease. Passes off stunts.
Rounds 2-3
Monster-sized, long-armed, physical specimen with the raw talent to emerge as a dominating NFL right tackle in any type of blocking scheme. Failed to live up to expectations in college as a result of tumultuous career marred by tragedy, suspensions, injuries and benchings. High-risk, high-reward wild card who must convince decision-makers he's worth gambling on. Has already been removed from many draft boards and must be paired with a veteran position coach nuanced in managing undisciplined, high-maintenance players.
-------------------------
Michael_Schofield 2543732 95
Prepped in suburban Chicago, where he also ran 110-meter hurdles his first two years in high school. Redshirted in 2009. Was a reserve/special-teams contributor in '10, appearing in all 13 games. Started 10 of 13 games at left guard in '11. Started all 26 games at right tackle 2012-13.
Not an explosive drive blocker who can clear holes with regularity. Average foot quickness. Tends to overextend and lunge in-line and on the move. Marginal reactive quickness and recovery speed for the outside. Exposed by edge speed (see Michigan State vs. Shilique Calhoun) -- cannot cut off the wide rush and struggles to handle quick, inside counters. Late to reach the second level.
Good run blocker -- drives his legs on contact and generates some power through his lower body. Can steer, control and lock down defenders once he gets his hands on them. Good playing demeanor -- gets after it and seeks to finish. Is tough-minded and hardworking. Gritty competitor.
Rounds 4-5
Quick-footed college right tackle with experience playing on the inside and offers versatility as a utility swing backup. Possesses eventual-starter potential, but could always be restricted by athletic limitations and leave teams desiring better.
-------------------------
Gabe_Jackson 2543733 81
Played for his father as a Mississippi prep. Redshirted in 2009. Started all 52 games of his career at left guard 2010-13. Did not give up a sack his last two seasons. Two-time team captain.
Lacks explosive power to shock defenders. Does not blow defenders off the ball in the run game. Average overall athletic ability and lateral agility. Is unsudden and lacks elite recovery quickness. Occasionally fails to dig his heels in and gives ground vs. strong bull rushes. Stressed to cut off fast-flowing linebackers. Recorded the slowest 20-yard split (3.28 seconds) and tied for the slowest 40 time (5.63 seconds) of any player at the combine. Could require some patience with complex playbooks.
Exceptional girth with long arms and a thick lower body. Fundamentally sound with advanced technique. Quick out of his stance. Good anchor. Strong, efficient punch (can pop and recoil). Keeps his hands inside and controls defenders. Mirrors in pass protection. Walls off running lanes. Understands positioning and angles. Athletic enough to short pull effectively -- nice balance and body control for a big man. Good eyes, awareness and reactions. Smart and tough. Durable four-year starter. Professional makeup.
Rounds 2-3
Big, thickly built, relatively nuanced blocker who brings a steadying presence to the interior offensive line. Dependability and effectiveness blocking for pass and run combined with sterling intangibles, including football intelligence, make him capable of starting as a rookie and holding down a position for years to come.
-------------------------
Michael_Sam 2543734 249
Also lettered in track and powerlifting as a Texas prep. Redshirted in 2009. Played all 13 games in '10 (one start) and tallied 24 tackles, seven for loss and 3.5 for sacks with an interception and a forced fumble. Played all 13 games in '11 (one start) and collected 29-3-1-1.5 with an interception. Started 9 of 12 games in '12 and was credited with 22-7-4.5 with two forced fumbles. Did not start against Central Florida, Vanderbilt and Alabama. Was the SEC Defensive Player of the Year (AP) in '13 when he started all 14 games and registered 48-19-11.5 with two batted passes and two forced fumbles. Would be the first openly gay active player in NFL history -- came out to his teammates in August, then announced his sexuality publicly prior to the NFL Scouting Combine.
Lacks burst and acceleration off the edge to get a step on blockers and finish. Sack production results from effort and production flushed to him and is not creatively produced with savvy pass-rush moves, speed, power or bend. Average hip flexibility and snap -- struggles clearing his hips at the top of his rush and trimming the corner. Adequate anchor vs. the run. Is late to disengage from blocks. Does not strike with authority. Inconsistent tackler. Late bloomer who could require time to adapt to the pro game. Poor combine showing -- bench-pressed 225 pounds just 17 times, recorded a 7.8-second 3-cone drill and posted an abysmal 25 1/2-inch vertical jump.
Good arm length. Anticipates the snap and has a very good initial first step. Plays hard -- gives great effort and competes every down. Good on-field intensity and demeanor. Attacks the edges aggressively and motor runs hot. Outstanding weight-room strength  -- can squat a small house. Very durable.
Round 7-Priority free agent
A productive, 4-3 weakside rusher who came on as a senior and it made his last season his best. Could fit most ideally as a 3-4 outside linebacker in a zone-blitzing scheme like the Steelers or Ravens.
-------------------------
Jordan_Tripp 2543735 171
Montana native whose father and grandfather also played for the Grizzlies. --NAME-- also ran track in high school. Was primarily a special-teams player as a true freshman in 2009 (wore jersey Number 44), tallying 23 tackles, zero for loss and zero sacks in 15 games. In '10, started 9 of 11 games at strong-side linebacker and was credited with 99-9-3.5 with three pass breakups and an interception return for a touchdown.

Wore Montana's legacy jersey Number 37 his final two seasons. Participated in East-West Shrine Game and Senior Bowl.
Has short flappers and gets stuck on blocks. Can do a better job using his hands to stack and shed. Plays a bit too out of control. Tightness shows up in space trying to break down and secure open-field tackles (misses too many). Wound tight in coverage and not quick to redirect (allows separation).
Triggers fast downhill vs. the run. Diagnoses quickly and is around the ball a lot. Outstanding motor, intensity and effort. Extremely competitive. Very tough. Outstanding weight-room work ethic. Sculpted with very minimal body fat. Elected team captain. Exceptional character. Emergency long snapper (started all four years). Has a special-teams temperament. Takes the game very seriously. Athleticism was on display at the combine -- paced linebackers with a 3.96-second short shuttle, recorded a 6.89-second 3-cone drill and vertical jumped 37 1/2 inches.
Rounds 5-6
A tough, determined, competitive overachiever capable of earning a job as a backup linebacker and special-teams performer.
-------------------------
Stanley_Jean-Baptiste 2543736 58
Was a wide receiver/safety as a Miami prep. Following high school, he spent one year at North Carolina Tech Preparatory Christian Academy, catching 36 passes for 580 yards. He attended Fort Scott (Kansas) Community College for one year, but did not see any football action. Redshirted as a receiver with Nebraska in 2010. Began the '11 season as a wide receiver before being converted to cornerback early in the campaign. Went on to play in nine games (including one start at right cornerback) and had nine tackles, one pass breakup and one interception. Saw action in 14 games in '12 (five starts at left cornerback) and registered 24-9-2. Had a 48-yard interception return for a score against Minnesota. Was Nebraska's top cover cornerback in '13, starting all 13 games and registering 41-12-4 with three tackles for loss and one sack. Had an interception in each of his first four games, including a 43-yard score against Southern Miss.
Has relatively small hands. Not especially strong for his size. Stiff hips. Is not a quick-twitch athlete and struggles to mirror sudden receivers. Lacks elite top-end speed (long-strider). Green positional instincts. Picks and chooses his spots to be physical -- inconsistent run defender. Has tweener traits. Football aptitude is lacking -- could struggle to grasp and execute complex assignments. Will be a 24-year-old rookie.
Physically impressive on the hoof -- looks every bit the part with outstanding size and length to mix it up with bigger receivers. Good balance and body control. Jumps routes. Has good hands to intercept and can highpoint throws. Flashes functional strength to reroute receivers, discard blocks and tackle ball carriers. Very productive on the ball in limited time as a starter -- 22 pass PBUs and seven INTs in 19 starts at Nebraska. Works to get better and made strides as a senior. Explosion was on display at the combine, where he posted a 41 1/2-inch vertical jump (best among defensive backs) and 10-foot, 8-inch broad jump.
Rounds 3-4
A converted receiver, --NAME-- possesses intriguing ball skills, rare leaping ability and clear upside, though he lacks ideal speed and flexibility, is smoother than he is sudden and does not consistently play to his size. Warrants developmental consideration from teams employing press or Cover-2, and will be in demand given the league's trend toward bigger defensive backs.
-------------------------
Joel_Bitonio 2543737 35
Prepped in California where he also played basketball and competed in shot put. Redshirted in 2009, earning Offensive Scout Team Player of the Year. Was a reserve and special-teams contributor in '10 (14 games). Started all 38 games at tackle 2011-13. Team captain.
Tends to shoot his hands wide and needs to improve placement -- too grabby. Slips off blocks and could stand to play more under control. Operated heavily out of a 2-point stance and might need to get acclimated to playing with his hand in the dirt. Average knee bend in pass protection.
Plays with vinegar and seeks to bury defenders -- nasty finisher who runs his feet on contact and consistently blocks defenders off the screen. Extremely tough and durable. Highly versatile -- can play any position on the line. Outstanding personal character and football character -- work ethic, leadership and responsibility are all exemplary. Produced the best 10-yard split (1.69 seconds) and 20-yard split (2.80) of any offensive lineman at the combine.
Round 2
An undersized college left tackle who projects best to the inside in the pros. Displays the tenacity, leg drive and mean streak that is highly coveted by OL coaches and could drive up his draft status. Could require some initial patience moving inside, yet possesses the skill set, intelligence and desire to successfully convert.
-------------------------
Kareem_Martin 2543738 84
Played football and basketball as a North Carolina prep. Played in 11 games (starting the first three at defensive end) as a true freshman in 2010 and had 16 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss and zero sacks with one pass batted. Moved into the starting lineup for good in '11 and tallied 40-7-4 with six passes batted, starting 13 games from the right DE position. Started all 12 games in '12 and recorded 40-15.5-4 with three passes batted and one forced fumble. Had at least one tackle for loss in 10 different games. In '13, he tied for eighth among FBS players in sacks, finishing the year 82-21.5-11.5 with three passes batted and three forced fumbles in 13 starts. Team captain.
Needs to bulk up and get functionally stronger. Has tapered legs and is not stout at the point of attack -- does not generate power through his lower half and is too easily displaced. Pad level fluctuates. Needs to improve as a hands fighter. Can do a better job protecting his legs. Average get-off -- pops up off the snap and initial steps are unthreatening. Rush lacks variety. Does not accelerate off blocks or consistently bend the corner. Occasionally loafs on the back side. Tweener traits.
Has very long arms. Good eyes and recognition -- senses screens, locates the ball and understands contain. Strong-handed to punch and extend. Good short-area burst. Uses his length to force his way into gaps. Flashes power potential. Nice closing speed. Wrap tackler. Football smart. Durable three-year starter. Solid personal and football character with leadership traits. Showed explosion at the combine, recording a 10-foot, 9-inch broad jump (best among defensive linemen) and a 35 1/2-inch vertical jump.
Rounds 2-3
Big, narrow-framed, long-levered defensive lineman who shows big-time flashes of potential as a 4-3 left end, though he needs to fortify his base as a run defender and hone his technique as a pass rusher. Possesses very intriguing dimensions for a rush OLB role in a traditional, two-gapping, 3-4 alignment and showed he is athletic enough to handle it at his pro day.
-------------------------
Dontae_Johnson 2543739 129
His first name is pronounced "DAHN-tay." Safety-receiver who also played basketball as a New Jersey prep. Played in 13 games (one start) as a true freshman for North Carolina State in 2010 and had 22 tackles, one pass breakup and zero interceptions. His first career start came at free safety against Boston College. Also returned three kickoffs for 40 yards (13.3-yard average). Played primarily as a nickel defender in '11, appearing in 13 games (two starts) and tallying 27-4-0 with three tackles for loss and three sacks. Moved to the boundary cornerback starting slot in '12 and recorded 70-8-0 with six tackles for loss, one sack and one forced fumble. Teamed with Redskins '13 second-rounder David Amerson to make up the tallest pair of starting cornerbacks in the country. Opened '13 at cornerback before switching back to free safety midway through the year. In 12 games (five starts at cornerback, seven at safety), he totaled 82-5-3.
Is lean and needs to bulk up and get stronger. Has short arms and small hands. Lacks elite top-end speed (struggled mightily to contain Clemson WR Sammy Watkins). Hesitates to diagnose from depth and takes some inaccurate angles. Shows tightness in transition. Struggles to break down and tackle in space. Ordinary ball production.
Good height, balance and athleticism. Can run with tight ends in coverage. Zone aware. Efficient plant-and-drive. Has a 38 1/2-inch vertical jump. Sets a hard edge in run support -- works to get off blocks, throws his weight around and tackles aggressively. Has played safety, cornerback, nickel and special teams. Smart and hardworking.
Rounds 3-4
Wiry, narrow-framed, high-cut, athletic defensive back who would be best in a predominantly zone scheme where he would have value as a versatile backup.
-------------------------
Billy_Turner 2543740 67
Father, Maurice, was a running back and kick returner drafted in the 12th round of the 1983 draft by the Vikings -- played 27 games with the Vikings, Packers and Jets (1984-85, 1987). Half brother, Brian Kehl, is a seven-year NFL linebacker. --NAME-- also played baseball as a Minnesota prep. As a true freshman in 2010, stepped into the lineup in Week Three, starting 12 of 13 games played at right tackle. Suffered a torn right thumb ligament in '11 fall camp -- sat out the season opener, but started all 14 games played at left tackle. Started all 30 games at LT 2012-13. Won three straight I-AA national championships.
Needs to improve his core strength and fortify his base. Plays too tall and narrow-based -- pad level fluctuates. Does not explode on contact. Footwork and technique need refinement. Carries his hands low. Tends to overextend and bend at the waist. Average contact balance and body control. Slides off blocks. Struggles to clear his feet as a puller. Inconsistent connecting and sustaining on the second level.
Big hands and nice length. Light on his feet. Flashes strength in his punch. Tries to run his feet on contact. Is athletic enough to fan the rush when all his moving parts are coordinated. Aware to handle stunts. Energetic playing temperament -- competes and blocks to the whistle. Four-year starter for the nation's preeminent I-AA program. Smart, hardworking and dependable. Has NFL bloodlines.
Rounds 3-4
Big-framed, raw, aggressive FCS standout who flashes a nice combination of foot quickness, punch strength and nastiness to warrant consideration as a project. Has a bit of a bull-in-a-china-shop element at this stage of his career, but has moldable tools and could easily develop into at least a swing backup and potentially more.
-------------------------
Jimmie_Ward 2543741 30
Has a child. Prepped in Alabama. As a true freshman in 2010, he logged 21 tackles, one pass breakup and zero interceptions with one forced fumble and a school-record three blocked punts. Returned a blocked punt 15 yards for a touchdown. Played in all 14 games, seeing extensive action as a backup free safety and on special teams. Registered 100-4-1 with 2.5 tackles for loss, one sack, one forced fumble and one blocked punt (against Army) in 14 games (12 starts at cornerback) in '11. Led the Huskies in tackles in '12 after posting 104-11-3 with one tackle for loss and one forced fumble in 13 starts at free safety. Missed the UMass game with sprained A/C joint in his right shoulder. In '13, logged 95-10-7 with 2.5 tackles for loss, one sack and one forced fumble in 14 starts. Had a 62-yard touchdown return for a score against Purdue. Did not work out at the combine because of a foot injury (medical exclusion).
Size is just adequate -- lacks ideal bulk and is built more like a cornerback than a safety. Bench-pressed 225 pounds just nine times at the combine, second fewest among DBs. Gets snagged on blocks and struggles to disengage. Can be a tick late diagnosing pass, gaining depth and digesting route combos. Lacks elite top-end speed.  Inconsistent downfield ball reactions with his back to the throw. Shows lower-body stiffness in space. Could rub some people the wrong way. Has some maturing to do and needs to learn what it means to prepare like a pro.
Intense, active and energetic. Zooms around the field and stands out on tape. Aggressive run supporter -- triggers quickly, flies downhill and chops down ball carriers. Breaks on throws and shows short-area burst to close. Has quick hands to snatch interceptions. Confident and energetic. Experienced and productive. Has a 38-inch vertical jump.
Rounds 2-3
Wiry, active, aggressive strong safety at his best playing downhill and reacting to plays in front him, yet possesses the cover skill to range over the top or lock down defenders in the slot. Ability to stay healthy in the future given lack of size and durability is the biggest concern. A very talented football player who could slide a round or two based on size, medical evaluations and attitude. Can contribute immediately at any safety position and positively affect the game if healthy and focused.
-------------------------
Carlos_Hyde 2543743 57
Grew up in Cincinnati before moving to Florida after his freshman year of high school. Participated in football, basketball and track as a prep -- rushing for 1,653 yards and 16 touchdowns as a senior. Committed to Ohio State, but didn't qualify academically, so he spent the 2009 fall semester at Fork Union Military Academy (Virginia) in order to raise his ACT score. Followed in the footsteps of Eddie George, who also started at Fork Union before heading to Ohio State. Arrived in Columbus in 2010 and played in seven games as a true freshman, rushing 24 times for 141 yards (5.9-yard average) and zero touchdowns. Started the first three games of the '11 season due to a teammate's suspension; played in 13 games overall and carried 106-566-6 (5.3) and caught 10-73-0 (7.3). Played in 10 games (eight starts) in '12 and piled up 185-970-16 (5.2) on the ground and 8-51-1 (6.4) receiving. Missed two games with a sprained MCL in his right knee. Was involved in an assault investigation during the summer of '13; was a "person of interest" after an altercation with a woman at a bar. Charges were dropped, but he was suspended for OSU's first three games for conduct not representative of the football program. Was a force upon returning to the gridiron, amassing 208-1,521-15 (7.3) rushing and 16-147-3 (9.2) receiving in 11 games (nine starts). Averaged 156.1 rushing yards per game in conference play and ended his career with nine consecutive 100-yard games. Became the first 1,000-yard running back during Urban Meyer's tenure as a head coach. Did not start against Illinois due to an academics issue, but came off the bench to put on a 24-246-4 performance -- along with a touchdown catch. Also had a 226-yard game against Michigan, the most ever for an OSU runner in that storied rivalry. Named the Big Ten's Running Back of the Year.
Lacks elite breakaway speed. Average elusiveness and make-you-miss. Is still learning what it means to really work and be a pro -- entered program with some underachiever traits early in career. Weight fluctuated earlier in his career and needs to pay more attention to nutrition. Has missed at least two games in three seasons.
Very well built -- looks every bit the part. Outstanding size, explosive power and run strength -- can be his own blocker and create his own holes. Punishes linebackers running downhill and almost always falls forward. Superb contact balance and finishing strength -- does not go down easily and can barrel through arm tackles. Extremely powerful short-yardage/goal-line runner. Gets better with a lather as the game progresses. Took over the game in the fourth quarter vs. Northwestern (2013) and willed team to victory. Surprisingly quick in short spaces and can plant hard and go. Is solid in pass protection and can stonewall blitzers in their tracks. Good awareness and anticipation to react to stunts and adjust to movement. Soft hands-catcher. Plucked the ball very naturally at his pro-day workout.
Rounds 1-2
A big, strong, powerful, NFL feature back who carried the Buckeyes' offense as a senior and proved he can be a workhorse. Solid all-around, chunk runner well-built for the physicality of the AFC North.
-------------------------
Jack_Mewhort 2543744 59
Ohio native. Was a reserve as a true freshman in 2010 when he appeared in 10 games. Started all 13 games in '11 -- the first five at left guard, the final eight at right guard. Suffered two broken ribs (when teammate Carlos Hyde slammed into him) against Nebraska, but did not miss any games. Was temporarily suspended from team activities in June '12 after being arrested for public urination (pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct). Started all 26 games at left tackle 2012-13. Team captain.
Has a soft midsection. Stronger than he is explosive. Lacks ideal length and foot quickness for the left side (not a dancing bear). Vulnerable to strong bull rush when he gets tall and narrow-based. Occasionally gets top-heavy and slips off blocks. Average blocking range. Tight hips and ankles show when he pulls or climbs to the second level. Struggles to cut off fast-flowing linebackers. Lets his pads rise outside the phone booth. Recorded a very ordinary 1.92-second 10-yard split at the combine, indicating average short-area quickness for the left side.
Good size. Engages with urgency. Reestablishes the line of scrimmage in the run game. Can drive block, widen the hole and seal lanes. Stout base -- good anchor strength. Plays with a load in his hands to jar defenders. Locks on and controls. Good enough feet to slide and mirror. Alert to stunts and blitzes. Versatile. Has an ideal temperament for the trenches -- breathes fire. Smart, tough and competitive. Three-year starter. Is passionate about the game and works at his craft. Highly respected vocal leader.
Rounds 2-3
Thickly built, physical, highly competitive lineman who manned left tackle competently in college, but is better suited for the right side in the pros. Has starter-caliber strength, athleticism and technique supplemented with desirable intangibles. Versatility to play guard or left tackle in a pinch adds to value.
-------------------------
Jalen_Saunders 2543745 104
Also ran track as a California prep. Began his college career at Fresno State in 2010, where he played all 13 games (one start) and had 30 receptions for 462 yards (15.4-yard average) and three touchdowns. Added 32 kickoff returns for 738 yards (23.1). Started 8 of 13 games in '11, snagging 50-1,065-12 (21.3). Following '12 spring practice, transferred to Oklahoma because he did not like the way he was being used in new head coach Tim DeRuyter's offense. Once eligible, he started 8 of 9 games for the Sooners and produced 62-829-3 (13.4). Started all 13 games in '13, totaling 61-729-8 (12.0). Also returned 31 career punts for 465 yards (15.0), including three scores.
Marginal size. Cannot play outside -- is easily knocked off course and needs a free release. Lets throws into his body. Small catch radius. Lacks elite top-end vertical speed, especially for his size (averaged just 12.0 yards per catch as a senior). Outmuscled in a crowd. Limited run strength. Lets throws into his body. Weak blocker -- gets ragdolled outside. Durability could be a concern -- is not built to take a pounding.
Light on his feet with a fluid stride. Good balance and body control. Nifty, conscientious route runner. Has speed and twitch to separate vs. man coverage -- sinks his hips with ease and pops out of breaks. Quick, soft hands. Slippery after the catch. Eludes the first tackler and can turn a short throw into a long gain if he gets a step. Three punt-return TDs in 25 returns at OU -- eludes the first wave, runs to daylight and can take it the distance.
Rounds 5-6
A lightweight, quicker-than-fast, competitive slot receiver and punt returner, --NAME-- will always have size limitations, but has the hands, suddenness, polish and moxie to be a useful piece for a creative offensive coordinator able to free him up. Return ability adds to value.
-------------------------
Josh_Huff 2543746 86
Prepped in Texas. Wore jersey Number 4 as a true freshman in 2010 when he played all 13 games (two starts) and made 19 catches for 303 yards (15.9-yard average) and three touchdowns with 23 kickoff returns for 567 yards (24.7). Strained his left knee during '11 spring practice, then had his left foot in a walking boot during fall camp. On the season, started 10 of 12 games played and managed 31-430-2 (13.9) receiving with 8-174 (21.8) on kickoff returns. Suffered an ankle injury in the season opener against LSU -- missed games against Nevada and Southwest Missouri State and did not start his first two games back. Was arrested in March '12 and charged with driving under the influence of marijuana, driving without a license and speeding, though he was ultimately acquitted. In the fall, started all 11 games played, recording 32-493-7 (15.4). Hurt his left knee against Fresno State and sat out against Tennessee Tech and Arizona. Started all 13 games in '13 and totaled 61-890-7 (14.6) with 11-252 (22.9) on kickoffs. Suffered a head injury against Stanford.
Could stand to get stronger. Was not pressed at Oregon. Lacks elite explosion and top speed to pull away vertically. Limited route tree. Could stand to refine his route running. Lets some throws into his body and tends to trap some. Not a go-up-and-get-it guy (average leaping ability). Is relatively na've through no fault of his own and off-field maturation is a work in progress. Could require emotional support and professional mentorship in order to avoid the pitfalls of NFL trappings.
Nice size with a lean, tight-skinned body. Very athletic with natural balance and body control. Good speed and a fluid stride. Soft, quick hands to extend and snatch throws off his frame. Makes contested grabs. Can take a hit and hang on. Settles in zone pockets. Creates after the catch -- competitive, elusive and strong. Playmaking ability -- averaged 18.4 yards per catch as a senior. Gets after it as a blocker -- works to position, fit and sustain. Desirable temperament -- determined, tough and confident. Has special-teams experience returning and covering kicks. Works hard and wants to be coached.
Rounds 5-6
Smooth, competitive, versatile receiver with an impressive skill set which translates well to the evolution of NFL offenses. Can work at flanker or slot and has potential to become a Number 2 or Number 3 receiver in a system incorporating spread concepts. Is the type of player you root for, having persevered through an adverse upbringing and lingering baggage, which forced him to mature the hard way. Would be best served landing in a close-knit locker room with a nurturing position coach.
-------------------------
Taylor_Hart 2543747 141
Engaged to a former Oregon Ducks volleyball player. Prepped in Oregon. Also played basketball. Redshirted in 2009 and fractured his right hand. Saw action in 12 games as a reserve defensive lineman in '10, managing 18 tackles, two tackles for loss and two sack with one batted pass. Did not play in the BCS National Championship game against Auburn. Posted 44-3-2.5 with two batted passes, one forced fumble and a blocked kick in 14 starts at defensive tackle in '11. Made the switch to defensive end in '12, playing in all 13 contests (12 starts, all but Stanford) and logged 36-11-8 with three batted passes and one forced fumble. Named the team's co-MVP after registering 75-6-3.5 with five batted passes and three forced fumbles in 13 starts. Made the first five starts at DE and the remaining seven at DT. Broke his left foot while training in January '13 -- missed the Senior Bowl and did not work out at the NFL Scouting Combine.
Could stand to add bulk to his frame and get functionally stronger. Average athlete. Not explosive. Ordinary get-off -- takes short initial steps and exposes his frame off the snap. Needs to play with more consistent pad level. Fairly linear rusher. Limited shoulder flexibility to dip and bend the edge. Stiffness shows in space.
Terrific size and length. Good eyes and awareness. Plays on his feet. Holds his ground at the point. Gains extension and can stack and shed. Collapses the pocket. Good range and pursuit effort. Closes hard. Strong wrap tackler (very good production) -- snares ball carriers and drags them to the turf. Good soldier who falls in line willingly and has clean character. Three-year starter.
Rounds 4-5
Big-framed, smart, active, high-effort player who willingly does the dirty work and will make it difficult for coaches to cut him. Best chance to stick could be as a five-technique, but could also draw interest as a developmental left end. Has the makeup to surprise if he learns to play with power.
-------------------------
Caraun_Reid 2543748 158
The New York prep enrolled at the Ivy League school in 2009 and played in 10 games as a true freshman, tallying 32 tackles, 4.5 tackles for loss and one-half sack with four passes batted. Saw action at both nose tackle and defensive end. Tore his left pectoral muscle in the '10 season opener at Lehigh and missed the rest of the campaign. Underwent surgery after the season. Returned in '11 and recorded 68-16-7 with three passed batted and one forced fumble and three blocked kicks in 10 games (nine starts). Led all Ivy League linemen in tackles. Started nine games in '12 and had 40-9.5-5 with one pass batted, one forced fumble and three blocked kicks. Missed the Penn game with a concussion. Was a finalist for the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year award in '13 after registering 26-11-6.5 with one pass batted in 10 starts, helping lead Princeton to a conference title. Team captain was just the second Princeton player ever to be invited to the Senior Bowl.
Tends to stand straight up, negating his quickness and power out of the gate. Is not stout and can be waylaid by the double team. Marginal upper-body strength (diminished from 2011 pectoral surgery). Shows little feel for blocking pressure and can be late to locate the ball. Can do a better job protecting his legs. Pushed around too easily. Durability issues have crept up throughout his career.
Very quick off the ball. Disruptive shooting gaps and working half a blocker. Active and energetic -- feet are always running. Plays hard and competes. Very good sack production from the interior (20.5 career sacks). Good intelligence. Is very young (entered college as 17-year-old freshman) and still growing into his body -- has physical upside. Good length and hand-eye coordination -- 7 career blocked kicks.
Rounds 3-4
A quick, agile, tilted nose who is effective slanting and stunting and working his way into the backfield. Has kicked outside in passing situations and has the tools to pique the interest of aggressive, one-gapping, 3-4 fronts such as the Jets, Steelers or Ravens as a five-technique. Developmental talent with raw traits to mold.
-------------------------
Jeff_Janis 2543750 236
Also played basketball as a Michigan prep. Broke a finger on his left hand as a senior, causing him to switch to running back -- returned to the field with a cast up to his left elbow. Redshirted in 2009. Started 6-of-10 games played in '10 and caught nine balls for 130 yards (13-yard average) and a touchdown. Started 8-of-11 games in '11, tallying 48-968-14 (20.2). Set SVSU single-season records for catches and receiving yards in '12 when he started all 11 games and piled up 106-1635-17 (15.4). Was Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference Offensive Back of the Year in '13 when he totaled 83-1,572-14 (18.9) in 12 contests.
Has very small, inconsistent hands -- will cradle the ball and use his body. Is not a nuanced route runner. Does not attack the ball in the air and will give up some break points. Not strong after the catch and will look for a soft landing spot. Can be fazed by traffic. Regularly faced Division II competition. Not a consistent blocker -- does not play to his size.
Exceptional measurables and leaping ability -- will test through the roof. Accelerates into routes quickly and can separate vertically and uncover underneath working short-to-intermediate zones. Terrific production -- carves up lesser competition and creates chunk plays. Good red-zone target. Exceptional work ethic. Outstanding football character. Very passionate about the game. Has a 37 1/2-inch vertical jump, posted a 3.98-second 20-yard shuttle (fourth-best among receivers) and a 6.64-second 3-cone time.
Rounds 3-4
A Division II standout with rare measurables and production, --NAME-- must prove that he can translate his small-school success to the field against better competition.
-------------------------
David_Fales 2543751 183
His brother, Austen, is a quarterback at San Jose State. Also lettered in basketball as a California prep. Began his collegiate career at Nevada where he redshirted behind Colin Kaepernick. Transferred to Monterey (Calif.) Peninsula College for the next two seasons, where he threw for 4,635 yards and 37 touchdowns. Moved on to San Jose State for the '12 campaign and completed 327-of-451 passes for 4,193 yards (72.5 percent) with 33 touchdowns and nine interceptions in 13 starts and was the FBS' most accurate passer. Named MVP of the Military Bowl after recording 395 yards and two touchdowns. Threw for 312-487-4,189-33-13 (64.1) in 12 starts in '13. Was one of only two QBs, joining Fresno State's Derek Carr, with 4,000-plus yards in both '12 and '13. Had a 17-8 career record in 25 starts. Team captain.
Lacks ideal height and has relatively small hands. Average foot athlete and escapability. Can improve maneuverability in the pocket. Not yet sophisticated with his eyes. Tends to stare down his primary. Arm strength is just functional -- struggles to drill velocity throws on a line and is not a natural deep thrower. Accuracy wanes downfield. Needs to improve against the blitz. Just a two-year starter.
Well built (works hard in the weight room). Sets up cleanly and with balance. Nice play fake. Compact, three-quarters release with clean, quick arm action. Throws a clean spiral with good short-to-intermediate accuracy. Flashes touch. Confident and competitive. Tough and durable. Sparkling intangibles -- outstanding personal and football character. Leads vocally and by example and is universally respected. Intelligent, passionate, motivated football junkie who takes pride in his craft and puts the time in to improve.
Rounds 5-6
Burst onto the scene as a junior-college transfer in 2012 when he led the nation in completion percentage (72.5), executing a quarterback-friendly system and putting himself on the NFL radar. Concerns about his height and arm strength will limit his appeal, but at worst should be a quality backup in a precision-matchup system.
-------------------------
Daniel_McCullers 2543754 215
The North Carolina prep began his college career at Georgia Military College in 2010, weighing nearly 400 pounds when he arrived on campus. As a freshman, he appeared in eight games and had 27 tackles, four tackles for loss and three sacks with four passes batted, one interception and one forced fumble. Became a top junior college recruit in '11, recording 37-9-2 in 10 games. Transferred to Tennessee in '12 and won the starting nose tackle job in camp, registering 39-5.5-1 with one pass batted, one forced fumble and one blocked kick in 12 games (seven starts). Started 12 games in '13 and had 33-4.5-.5 with one blocked kick. Did not run at the NFL Scouting Combine because of a strained right hamstring.
Lets his pads rise (first move is up), gets outleveraged and does not hold his ground as well as a man his size should. Gets turned out of the hole and sealed. Duck-footed short-stepper with limited play range -- does not make plays outside the box. Average body power to roll his hips and generate torque. Limited pass-rush potential (confirmed by 1.5 career sacks) -- is late off the ball, does not collapse the pocket and stays blocked too long. Must improve his hand use to disengage. Exited high school pushing 400 pounds and weight has fluctuated in the past.
Rare size with vines for arms, an enormous wingspan and exceptional mass to occupy space and hold up multiple blockers -- has clear two-gap potential. Looks every bit the part with a relatively lean build for a 350-pounder -- carries his weight well with some muscle definition and good overall body thickness. Can overpower zone blockers with sheer size. Very durable and has not missed any games to injury throughout his career.
Rounds 2-3
A big-boned, short-area plugger with some underachiever traits, --NAME-- has raw tools that could become special if he learns to harness the innate strength in his body and pairs with a DL coach who can refine his mechanics.
-------------------------
Ja'Wuan_James 2543755 19
Prepped in Georgia. Enrolled in January 2010 and immediately took ownership of the right tackle position. Started all 49 games of his career (2010-13), setting a school record for career starts by an offensive lineman. Sprained his knee during Senior Bowl practice.
Raw footwork. Has a lot of heaviness in body and can improve sustain. Lumbers to the second level and struggles to cut off and adjust to moving targets. Does not roll off the ball with power and generate strength or movement in the run game.
Outstanding size, girth and overall body mass. Good hand placement. Can steer and control blockers once he gets his hands on them. Very patient pass protector. Matches up very well vs. size and power (see Alabama). Battle-tested, experienced four-year starter in the SEC. Outstanding personal and football character. Very smart, mature and highly respected.
Rounds 2-3
Big, strong, heavy pass protector with good balance, anchor strength and hand use to handle power and speed. Does not affect the run game the same way and almost appears more destined for the left side in the pros. Has instant-starter potential.
-------------------------
Kadeem_Edwards 2543756 143
Won a state title as a Florida prep. Manned left guard all four years. As a true freshman in 2010, started 9 of 10 games played. Did not play against Austin Peay and did not start against North Carolina A&T. Started all 10 games played at LG in '11, missing just the season finale against Jacksonville State because of a left ankle sprain. Started all 11 games in '12. Started 12 of 13 games played in '13 -- did not play against Austin Peay and did not start against Eastern Illinois.
Could stand to shed some bad weight. Gets lax with his technique. Needs to play with more consistent pad level. Needs to work on a more efficient short punch. Lets his feet stall. Thick, tight hips -- struggles to maneuver and snap is limited. Is not sudden or explosive -- more push than pop. Lets defenders cross his face. Intermittent urgency. Does not dominate physically inferior competition.
Outstanding size -- built low to the ground with a thick trunk and vines for arms (big wingspan). Generates movement in the run game and seeks to bury defenders. Surprising balance and straight-line foot speed -- steps to the second level easily. Has crude tools to work with. Motivated and coachable.
Rounds 4-5
A soft-spoken, thickly built, long-armed FCS prospect, --NAME-- is a raw base blocker who must make significant strides with his technique, ratchet up his play-to-play intensity and learn to play with power.
-------------------------
Jake_Matthews 2543758 6
Son of Hall of Famer Bruce --NAME--. Uncle, Clay --NAME-- Jr., was a Pro Bowl linebacker for the Browns; cousin, Clay III, is an All-Pro linebacker for the Packers; and cousin, Casey, is a linebacker for the Eagles. --NAME-- was a USA Today and Parade All-American. Played 10 games as a true freshman in 2010, starting the final seven at right tackle. Started all 26 games at RT 2011-12. In '13, replaced Jaguars first-rounder Luke Joeckel at left tackle and started all 13 games. Team captain.
Arm length appears too short -- limited reach and extension. Operated in a spread offense. Can do a better job sustaining (though was presented with a near-impossible task of knowing where the pocket would be to protect). Has only one year of experience at left tackle.
Big, strong, athletic, natural bender. Exceptional technician. Explosive six-inch punch -- quick, active hands. Outstanding base, balance, body control and hand placement. Drives defenders off the ball -- outstanding run blocker. Explosive hip snap. Takes good angles to the second level. Plays with very good awareness -- shows very good athletic ability flipping his hips and adjusting to moving pockets with a jitterbug quarterback. Keen to recognize and quick to adjust to the blitz. Strong finisher -- displays a mean streak and seeks to finish. Has long-snapping experience. Hails from football royalty family -- third-generation NFLer. Tough competitor. Very focused and determined. Humble and grounded. Outstanding all-around character. Film junkie. Started in the SEC for 3-plus seasons. Extremely durable -- missed no time to injuries.
Round 1 (top 10)
Smart, tough, versatile franchise left tackle capable of playing all five positions on the line. Can plug into a starting lineup immediately and will play a long time at a consistently high level. One of the safest picks in the draft, --NAME--' best position might even be center.
-------------------------
Ryan_Grant 2543759 142
Prepped in Texas. As a true freshman in 2009, appeared in nine games and recorded nine receptions for 39 yards (4.3-yard average) and a touchdown. Started 6-of-12 games in '10, tallying 33-515-4 (15.6). Started one game in '11, but was granted a medical hardship because of season-ending hernia injury. Returned to start all 12 games in '12, snagging 76-1,149-6 (15.1). Led the team in receiving for the second year in a row in '13 when he started 12-of-13 games (gave way to two tight ends against Syracuse) and produced 77-1,039-9 (13.5).
Could stand to improve functional strength and physicality. Can be jammed and rerouted at the line. Pedestrian speed. Is an unpolished route runner and does not consistently separate -- drifts into patterns neglecting deception and does not snap off breaks. Limited route tree. Marginal blocker. Appears lackadaisical at times -- intermittent intensity, urgency and compete level. Questionable courage to work the middle of the field.
Good size. Smooth accelerator off the line. Good flexibility to sink his hips. Tracks throws and shows terrific body control to adjust. Impressive hands catcher -- quick, soft mitts. Makes NFL-caliber catches, snatching throws out of the air away from his body. Determined runner with the ball in his hands. Nice upfield quickness to pick up yards after the catch. Good field awareness.
Rounds 6-7
Productive, monotone, unrefined, enigmatic mid-major receiver with one of the best pair of hands in the draft, though he comes with concerning tweener traits he will have to overcome. Lacks ideal speed and physicality to survive outside and lacks ideal suddenness and toughness to thrive inside. Workout numbers will be critical.
-------------------------
Jordan_Zumwalt 2543760 192
Highly recruited inside linebacker who also played basketball as a California prep. Verballed to Stanford, but signed with UCLA. Played 11 games as a true freshman in 2010 -- injuries thrust him into the starting lineup at middle linebacker the final four games and he produced 32 tackles, three for loss and three sacks. Played all 13 games in '11, starting four (three at weakside linebacker, one at MLB), and notched 60-6-0 with a pass breakup and an interception. Playing in a 3-4 in '12 -- started 9-of-13 games (five at left inside linebacker, four at left outside linebacker) and totaled 71-8-2 with a pass breakup, two forced fumbles and a blocked kick. Did not play against Colorado after a scooter accident required stitches, leaving him unable to wear a helmet. Started all 13 games in '13 (12 at LILB, one at LOLB) and registered 93-5.5-0 with two interceptions and three forced fumbles. Did not bench press at the NFL Scouting Combine (left shoulder).
Does not play strong. Mechanical mover. Tight-hipped with average change of direction. Gets outflanked to the corner vs. speed. Average knockback body power -- does not strike with thump to drive back ball carriers. Catches too much. Struggles to disengage from blocks when he is locked up. Limited coverage range. Has small hands and a relatively short wingspan given his height.
Very competitive with a fiery, on-field temperament. Explosive hitter. Throws his body around recklessly and times up the blitz well (disruptive presence). Is around the ball a lot. Very good football intelligence -- lines up teammates and makes adjustments. Versatile and has played all linebacker positions and contributed as a fullback in short-yardage situations. Defensive tone-setter -- has a love for the game and it shows. Plays big on big stages -- capped his career with co-MVP effort in the Sun Bowl vs. Virginia Tech, when he knocked Logan Thomas unconscious and returned an interception 43 yards.
Rounds 4-5
High-energy overachiever with a special-teams temperament. Stands out most for his competitiveness, effort, versatility and swagger. Brings the feisty type of attitude desired on a Jeff Fisher or Jim Schwartz defense. Will factor immediately on special teams and could work his way into a starting lineup.
-------------------------
Shaq_Evans 2543761 115
Highly recruited California prep. Began his college career at Notre Dame in 2009 when he saw action in six games and caught seven balls for 61 yards (8.7-yard average) and zero touchdowns. Transferred to UCLA and sat out '10 per NCAA rules. Played 13 games in '11, starting five at flanker, and tallied 19-309-2 (16.3) with 17 punt returns for 115 yards (6.8). Served a one-game suspension against California for his role in a fight against Arizona. Started all 14 games at the "Z" receiver in '12, snagging 60-877-3 (14.6) with 8-85 (10.6) on punt returns. Was the Bruins' leading receiver for the second straight season in '13 when he started 12-of-13 games at the "Z" and totaled 47-709-9 (15.1). Non-start was against New Mexico State when the Bruins had 10 players on the field for the first play from scrimmage to honor former teammate Nick Pasquale, who died in September after being hit by a car.
Average production. Lacks top-end burst, acceleration and long speed. Does not threaten the field vertically. Soft-tempered blocker. Displays little creativity after the catch. Struggles to shake tight man coverage and create separation.
Good size. Good enough hands -- catches balls that he should and makes hard catches look easy, yet drops easy catches. Extends outside his frame for the ball and can pluck it. Competes in a crowd and can make contested catches.  Tied for the fastest 10-yard split (1.47 seconds) of any combine participant.
Rounds 3-4
Good-sized, sure-handed possession receiver with the toughness to work through the middle and catch in a crowd. Can make a living as a zone-beating, move-the-chains target.
-------------------------
Keith_McGill 2543762 116
Has a daughter. The California prep earned letters in football, basketball and track, graduating high school in 2007. After not playing in 2008, he enrolled at Cerritos (Calif.) College in '09 and played in 11 games at free safety, recording 24 tackles, three pass breakups and four interceptions with one-half tackle for loss and one forced fumble. Earned Southern California Football Association Northern Conference Defensive Player of the Year honors in '10, tallying 37-5-7 with one forced fumble, two blocked kicks and a fumble recovery for a touchdown. Blocked a field goal attempt by Bakersfield College on the last play of the game, finishing the play by receiving a lateral at the 35-yard line and scoring the game-winning touchdown. Arrived at Utah in '11 and saw action in the season's first five games (including a start at free safety against USC), recording 12-1-0. Sustained a season-ending shoulder injury in the Arizona State game. Missed the entire '12 season due to extensive rehab of the shoulder, which required surgery. Was healthy in '13 and started all 12 games at cornerback, totaling 37-12-1 with one-half tackle for loss. Returned an interception 19 yards for a touchdown against UCLA.
Lacks the physicality and toughness desired at safety. Does not support the run aggressively or play to his size. Average transitional quickness. Footwork needs refinement. Recorded the worst 3-cone time (7.29 seconds) among cornerbacks at the combine. Will be a 25-year-old rookie. Still has some junior-college work habits and needs to learn what it means to be a pro.
Rare size with extremely long arms and large hands -- looks every bit the part. Very good athletic ability. Explosive -- recorded 39-inch vertical jump and 10-foot, 9-inch broad jump. Versatile and can play safety or corner.
Rounds 2-3
Big, athletic, press-man corner with intriguing dimensions and movement skills. However, he does not consistently play to his size, needs to adopt a professional approach to the game and will have to be micromanaged. Would ideally fit in Seattle or Jacksonville.
-------------------------
Wesley_Johnson 2543763 173
Nashville native who won a state championship and competed in track and field (throws) as a prep. Redshirted in 2009. Started all 12 games at left tackle in '10. Started all 13 games in '11 -- seven at center, four at LT, two at left guard. Started all 26 games at LT 2012-13, allowing just two sacks. Two-year captain.
Average length. Is not built for power. Needs to bulk up and get functionally stronger. Light anchor -- stressed by power rushers. Does not jolt defenders with his hands. Average explosion/pop on contact. Inconsistent connecting with moving targets and fitting on linebackers. Has had difficulty filling out his frame and maintaining weight.
Quick out of his stance. Natural bender with athletic, coordinated movement. Light on his feet and can work his hips. Keeps his hands inside and can pop and recoil. Shuffles, slides and mirrors. Gets to the second level with ease and can wheel around the edge as a puller. Durable, versatile 51-game starter -- has experience playing all across the line. Highly respected, passionate, no-nonsense vocal leader.
Rounds 4-5
Experienced, intelligent, competitive, athletic, strength-deficient zone blocker. Has everything you want intangibly and has developmental value, but has to make significant strength gains and perfect his technique to survive against longer, more powerful NFL defensive ends. Has worked out as a center in the spring and might be most natural inside.
-------------------------
Brent_Urban 2543765 134
Grew up in suburban Toronto. Also played basketball and hockey his first two years in high school, but committed to football as an upperclassman. Redshirted in 2009. Tore his left ACL in the spring of '10, and saw very limited action in three games in the fall. Played all 13 games in '11 and was credited with 15 tackles, 2.5 for loss and zero sacks -- battled a wrist injury and had it surgically repaired after the season. Started all 12 games at defensive end in '12, recording 20-2.5-2 with two passes batted and one forced fumble. Returned a fumble 16 yards for a touchdown at Virginia Tech. Dealt with a high ankle sprain in '13, starting eight games (and missing four) and totaling 40-11.5-1 with an NCAA-leading nine passes batted. Was forced to withdraw from the Senior Bowl due to recurring issues with the ankle, then was a medical exclusion at the NFL Scouting Combine (knee). Was drafted by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the second round (15th overall selection) of the 2013 CFL Draft.
Limited lower-body strength to anchor vs. double teams. Shows some stiffness through his shoulders and torso. Still developing recognition and instincts. Still learning blocking schemes and how to fight pressure. Needs to improve hand use (quickness and violence). Has to concentrate on keeping his pad level low -- gets uprooted and washed when he plays too tall. Linear, vanilla pass rusher (recorded just three career sacks). Relatively inexperienced. Grew up in a Canadian hockey town and has a mellow disposition that might not sit well with some people.
Looks the part -- has stature on the defensive line thanks to a long, well-proportioned physique with relatively little body fat. Has ideal dimensions for an odd front and has a large wingspan that enables him to disrupt passing lanes. Engages quickly off the snap, jolts blockers and gains extension. Can stack and shed or press single blocking and generate push. Flashes disruptive ability. Can slide inside as a nickel rusher to cave the pocket.
Rounds 4-5
Tall, angular, late-blooming five-technique prospect with the body type sought by teams employing odd fronts. Should only get bigger, stronger and more polished. If so, has potential to grow into an impact lineman. Broken foot bone suffered in freak accident prior to Senior Bowl could hinder his draft status.
-------------------------
Logan_Thomas 2543767 120
The Virginia prep participated in the U.S. Army Bowl and was the top-ranked tight end prospect in the country. Redshirted in 2009. Saw action in seven games in '10 as a quarterback and wide receiver, completed 12-of-26 passes for 107 yards (84.6 percent) with zero touchdowns and zero interceptions. Ran the ball six times for 22 yards (3.7-yard average) and zero touchdowns, in addition to catching a 2-yard touchdown pass vs. Wake Forest. Started all 14 games at quarterback in '11 and threw for 234-391-3,013-19-10 (60.0) while rushing 153-469-11 (3.1). Set the school record for rushing touchdowns by a QB. Led the Hokies in rushing in '12 with 174-524-9 (3.0) and throwing 220-429-2,976-18-16 (51.3) in 13 starts. Made every start for the Hokies for a third straight season, tossing 227-402-2,907-16-13 (56.5) and rushing 162-344-4 (2.1) in 13 games. Was knocked out of the Sun Bowl early with a head injury. Team captain. Finished his career with 9,103 yards and 53 touchdowns, both school records. Had a 26-14 record in 40 career starts.
Plateaued as a sophomore. Uneven performance. Inconsistent footwork and mechanics. Shoddy ball placement. Still developing touch and deep-ball accuracy. Needs to quicken his eyes and expand his field vision. Needs to learn to protect himself -- is not elusive and represents a big target to defenders. Struggled in big games, including a nightmare performance against Alabama. Too careless with the football -- 39 INTs and 23 fumbles as a starter. Career 50-percent passer on third down.
Outstanding size, stature and strength -- towers over the line, has natural throwing lanes from the pocket and is able to make plays in the grasp. Athletic -- can climb the pocket, escape and run for the sticks. Load to bring down. Generates easy velocity with a quick, compact release and can make all the throws. Is very competitive and will sell out to make a play. Has upside. Tough and durable -- started 40 consecutive games. Vocal leader. Was the only quarterback to crack a ball speed of 60 mph on the radar gun at the combine and can flat-out rip it.
Rounds 3-4
Unrefined, strong-armed, sturdy pocket passer who looks the part and has intriguing, raw arm talent, though he is a converted tight end whose inexperience showed throughout a yo-yo career in Blacksburg. Has definite developmental value given his starter-caliber skill set and intangible makeup. Would benefit from coaching continuity, more specifically a QB coach capable of refining his crude talent.
-------------------------
Mike_Campanaro 2543768 218
Prepped in Maryland, where he was a standout running back, kick returner and safety -- won a pair of state championships, amassed more than 6,500 yards and 90 touchdowns and notched eight kick return scores. Redshirted in 2009. Played all 12 games (one start) in '10 and caught 10 balls for 107 yards (1.7-yard average) and zero touchdowns. Started 10-of-12 games played in '11, snagging 73-833-2 (11.4). Injured his right hamstring against North Carolina State and sat out against Gardner-Webb. Started 9-of-10 games played at flanker in '12, managing 79-763-6 (9.7). Broke his right hand against Duke, missed two games and was restricted by a splint in others. Sat out '13 spring practice while recovering from left ankle surgery. At flanker in the fall, started all eight games played and paced Demon Deacon receivers for the second straight year with 67-803-6 (12.0). Was held out of the season opener against Presbyterian (tight hamstring) and missed the final three games because of a broken collarbone suffered against Syracuse. Owns the school record for career receptions (229).
Lacks ideal height and length -- has extremely short arms and can be hemmed at the line. Limited functional strength. Small catch radius. Lacks elite top-end speed to take the top off. Spotty concentration -- makes some focused grabs and drops others he shouldn't. Marginal blocker. Durability is an issue -- has a small build, has been dinged up and could struggle to stay healthy. Had the smallest wingspan (70 1/2 inches) of any receiver at the combine.
Has short-area quickness to separate short-to-intermediate. Good balance and hip flex. Adjusts to throws. Finds soft spots in zone coverage. Effective running drags and crossers. Tough, confident and competitive. Three-year starter. Solid character.
Round 7-Priority free agent
Undersized, slippery, competitive inside receiver who brings a possession element to the slot. Lacks ideal explosiveness and will have to prove himself on special teams to earn an extended look.
-------------------------
Deone_Bucannon 2543769 27
His name is pronounced "DAY-own byew-CAN-nin)." Defensive back-receiver who also golfed as a California prep. Fractured his left collarbone in his final high school game. Played in 12 games (eight starts at strong safety) as a true freshman in 2010 and had 84 tackles, five pass breakups and two interceptions with four tackles for loss and two forced fumbles. Started 11-of-12 games in '11 and registered 80-4-3 with two tackles for loss, one forced fumble and one blocked field goal. Appeared in 12 games (11 starts) in '12 and had 106-4-4 with three tackles for loss, one sack and one forced fumble. Led the team in tackles. Was suspended for the first half of the UNLV contest as punishment for a hit to the head on a defenseless receiver. In '13, started all 13 games and totaled 114-1-6 with 4.5 tackles for loss and three forced fumbles. Led the Pac-12 in tackles and tied for the lead in interceptions. Also played on the kickoff and punt coverage teams and tied for the team lead with seven special-teams tackles. Three-time captain concluded his college career ranking among the WSU all-time leaders in tackles (384) and interceptions (15).
Struggles to recover from missteps and will not track anyone down from behind. Some tightness in his hips. Takes some inaccurate angles. Man-coverage limitations (struggles to mirror slot receivers). Can be overaggressive and miss tackles. Does not always arrive under control in space. Lacks discipline on the field and makes too many mental mistakes. Got shook in the hole for a 75-yard TD vs. Colorado State and gives up too many big plays with bad angles.
Good length and overall size. Reads run and drops downhill quickly. Has an old-school mentality -- likes contact and is a physical tackler (seeks to punish the ball carrier). Shows pop on contact. Covers kicks and has an ideal mentality for special teams. Productive four-year starter.
Rounds 2-3
Good-sized, athletic, physical safety who stands out as a straight-line striker on tape and sets the tone. Has coverage limitations, but brings aggressiveness and intensity to carve a niche as a downhill box defender and core special-teams player. Must learn to become more assignment sound to maximize his potential. Has some similarities to Tampa Bay FS Dashon Goldson.
-------------------------
Charles_Sims 2543770 69
Was a three-star recruit from Houston who stayed home to play for the Cougars. The true freshman earned the Conference USA Freshman of the Year Award after rushing 132 times for 698 yards (5.3-yard average) and nine touchdowns to lead the squad in yards and touchdowns. Played in all 14 games (nine starts) and caught 70 passes for 759 yards (10.8) and one touchdown -- fourth-leading receiver in Cougars' high-octane offense. Sat out the '10 season after being ruled ineligible by the NCAA but was allowed to redshirt. Returned to lead the team in rushing in '11, producing 110-821-9 (7.5) on the ground and contributing 51-575-4 (11.3) as a receiver in 13 games (nine starts). Did not play against North Texas. Was named the team MVP in '12 after tallying a team-high 142-851-11 (6.0) rushing and 37-373-3 (10.1) receiving in only nine starts. Dealt with leg injuries all year, missing the Tulsa and Tulane games (sprained right ankle) and UCLA (groin) in addition to sitting out the second half of three games. Graduated in May of '13 with a health education degree and asked to be released from his scholarship but UH put a number of restrictions on his transfer -- no Texas schools, no American Athletic Conference teams and no one on their '13 schedule. Chose West Virginia over California and was named the Big 12 Newcomer of the Year after racking up a team-high 208-1095-11 (5.7) on the ground and tied for team lead in receptions with 45-401-3 (8.9) in 12 starts. Ranked second in the conference with 1,549 all-purpose yards.
Does not have an ideal build for the position and durability is a concern -- is narrow with a relatively thin lower body. Needs to bulk up. Relatively tall running style. Can do a better job running behind his pads and converting speed to power. Shows some hip tightness. Average tackle breaker (too often grounded by single tacklers). Ran exclusively out of the pistol/shotgun formation. Has very small hands and carries loosely at times. Lacks elite, top-end "wow" speed. Blocking is a question mark. Will be a 24-year-old rookie.
Quick-footed with first-step suddenness and short-area burst. Fluid and fast -- accelerates in a hurry and shows speed to the edge. Explosive one-cut ability -- understands how to get downhill. Loose lower body with nice ankle flexion to cut sharply. Flashes ability to spin off contact. Soft hands -- catches easily away from his body (had 70 catches as a freshman and averaged more than 10 yards per catch for his career). Creates after the catch. Hardworking and leads by example.
Rounds 4-5
Athletic, competitive, tough, upright slasher who is an asset as a receiver -- hands rate among the best on a RB in recent years. Cannot project as a bellcow, but offers playmaking ability as part of a tandem in a zone scheme. Speed and durability could determine ultimate draft value.
-------------------------
Chris_Borland 2543772 77
Linebacker-running back who also lettered in basketball, tennis and track and field as an Ohio prep. Was the Big Ten Freshman of the Year in 2009. Backed up weakside linebacker Mike Taylor until Taylor was lost for the season in Week Seven -- played all 13 games, starting five of the final six, and recorded 54 tackles, including 10.5 for loss and five sacks with two pass breakups, an interception, five forced fumbles and a blocked kick. Did not start against Hawaii when the Badgers opened with an extra defensive back. Played through a torn left labrum, routinely dealt with his shoulder popping and had postseason surgery which sidelined him for '10 spring practice. In the fall, managed 7-2-1 in two games played -- started the season opener against UNLV, hurt his left shoulder, sat out against San Jose, then re-injured the shoulder against Arizona State prompting season-ending surgery. Also had surgery in December to repair a tear in his right labrum. Was granted a medical hardship, preserving a year of eligibility. Started all 14 games at middle linebacker in '11 and totaled 143-19-2.5 with five pass breakups, two interceptions and five forced fumbles. Started all 12 games played at MLB in '12, collecting 104-10-4.5 with six pass breakups and three forced fumbles. Did not play against Ohio State and Penn State (right hamstring). Earned first-team All-Big Ten honors for the third straight season and was named the conference's Defensive Player of the Year in '13 when he led the Badgers in tackles -- amassed 112-8.5-4 with two pass breakups and two forced fumbles in 12 starts at MLB. Strained his right hamstring against Illinois and sat out against Iowa. His 15 career forced fumbles are second-most in FBS history. Started 45 career games.
Is short with Tyrannosaurus rex arms -- too easily neutralized (struggles to disengage). Eclipsed by larger offensive linemen. Can do a better job protecting his legs. Average explosion, tackle strength and pop on contact. Lets runners escape his grasp. Exposed in space. Has man-coverage limitations, especially against tight ends (lacks length to match up). Durability could be an issue.
Is built low to the ground and bends his knees. Keen eyes and instincts -- has a nose for the ball. Quick to fill downhill (see goal-line play vs. Ohio State when he stuck RB Carlos Hyde in the hole and drove him back). Motor runs hot -- pursues hard and seldom quits on plays. Flows well laterally. Aware in zone. Capable of bringing pressure as a blitzer. Good leaping ability. Intense competitor who loves to play and it shows. Defensive playmaker -- piled up 50 career TFL and 14 FFs. Special intangibles.
Rounds 4-5
Short, active, athletic, instinctive tackling machine who will have to overcome physical limitations to establish himself as a dependable, long-term starter, though he has immediate special-teams ability and the makeup to push for a more prominent role.
-------------------------
James_White 2543773 130
Distant cousin of NFL players Santana and Sinorice Moss. The Florida prep also played baseball. Named Big Ten Freshman of the Year in 2010 after leading the team in rushing with 156 carries for 1,052 yards (6.7-yard average) and 14 touchdowns while grabbing 11 passes for 88 yards (8.0) in 12 games. Did not play at Purdue with a left knee injury (sprained MCL). In '11, he saw action in all 14 games and logged 141-713-6 (5.1) on the ground and 15-150-0 (10.0) in the air. Missed most of '12 spring practice with left knee (tear in meniscus) injury. Spent the fall as a backup to Broncos 2013 second-rounder Montee Ball and was the second-leading rusher with 125-806-12 (6.4) while grabbing 8-132-1 (16.5) in 14 games. Had 119 rushing yards, four rushing touchdowns and threw a 3-yard touchdown pass in the Big Ten Championship game against Nebraska. Was the Badgers' second-leading rusher in '13 after amassing 221-1,444-13 (6.5) in 13 games, including the first 12 starts of his career (only non-start was Ohio State). Also hauled in 39-300-2 (7.7). Helped set the FBS single-season record with 3,052 rushing yards by teammates (Melvin Gordon 1,609). Had 670 career receiving yards, which set the school record for a running back. Had 39 career kickoff returns for 765 yards (19.6-yard average).
Played in an offense that helped inflate his production. Undersized with exceptionally short arms and small hands. Run strength is just adequate. Limited power to move the pile or bust through tackles. Lacks bulk strength to stymie blitzers. Was never a feature back, splitting carries with Broncos 2013 second-rounder Montee Ball as a junior and Melvin Gordon as a senior.
Controlled mover with a low center of gravity. Good vision, balance and short-area burst. Shifty runner -- cuts efficiently and jukes tacklers. Shows competitive speed. Finishes runs. Willing blocker in pass protection. Takes care of the football -- fumbled just twice in 754 career touches. Has kickoff-return experience. Tough and competitive. Good football aptitude. Highly respected by teammates and coaches.
Round 7-Priority free agent
--NAME-- had a very productive career despite splitting carries for four years, and offers a balanced enough skill set to factor as a recyclable, complementary, change-of-pace back in the pros.

Also returned 55 career punts for 587 yards (10.7), including a score, and 31 career kickoffs for 800 yards (25.8). Burlsworth Trophy winner as nation's best player to begin his career as a walk-on.
Has a slender build and needs to bulk up and get stronger. Ordinary pop off the line. Builds to average speed. Could struggle to separate vs. quick-twitch covermen. Lets throws into his body and breaks stride to catch. Not a jumpball player (30 1/2-inch vertical jump). Straightlinish after the catch -- pedestrian agility and elusiveness. Has a history of concussions. Bench-pressed 225 pounds just four times, lowest of all combine participants.
Uses his hands well to swat away press. Stems his routes. Sells his patterns. Nice hands. Good field and boundary awareness. Gives effort to engage and shield cornerbacks as a blocker. Outstanding football intelligence -- like a quarterback on the outside. Productive three-year starter. Mature and humble. Hardworking and coachable. Carved up Ohio State CB Bradley Roby to the tune of 10-207-1.
Rounds 4-5
A former walk-on, --NAME-- went from afterthought to scholarship player to Number 1 receiver. While the blue-collar overachiever lacks exceptional athletic traits for the NFL, he's a steady "X" receiver whose hands and smarts could enable him to work his way into a Number 3 or Number 4 receiver role.

Dezmen_Southward 2543775 68
His stepfather, Eli Rasheed, played football at Indiana and is currently the defensive line coach at Toledo. Didn't start playing football until his senior year, when he started at defensive back for national champion St. Thomas Aquinas in Florida. Also lettered in basketball and track. Redshirted in 2009 before playing in all 13 games as a reserve in 2010, making eight tackles, no pass breakups and no interceptions. Saw action in 13 games (three starts at strong safety) in 2011 and logged 35 tackles, two pass breakups and no interceptions with two forced fumbles. Did not play against Illinois (coach's decision). Moved into the starting lineup at free safety in 2012 and produced 69 tackles, four pass breakups and one interception with eight tackles for loss and one forced fumble in 14 games. Had a career-high 12 tackles in the Big Ten Championship game vs. Nebraska. Filled in on the track team in the spring of 2013 after some sprinters were injured, running the 100 meters and the 4x100 relay. Moved to strong safety for the 2013 campaign and recorded 40 tackles, five pass breakups and one interception with 3.5 tackles for loss and one forced fumble in 13 starts. Was medically excluded at the combine because wrist and spine injuries.
Short arms. Average hip flexibility and range. Still developing positional instincts and diagnostic skills. Man-coverage limitations. Dull transitional quickness and closing burst. Liability in man-off coverage. Ordinary production on the ball -- not a playmaker. Marginal feel and awareness. Does not punish or intimidate. Reliability should be looked into.
Excellent size. Good straight-line speed. Bends his knees and pedals softly. Reacts well to plays in front of him. Played a hybrid safety role at UW, including defending slot receivers (even played CB in a pinch against BYU). Special-teams experience. Recorded a 4.38-second 40 time, a 42-inch vertical jump and 6.50-second three-cone time at his pro day workout.
Rounds 4-5
--NAME--, who played only one year of high school football, is a size-speed prospect still learning positional nuances. Could get his foot in the door on special teams and buy some time to develop as a reserve. Strong pro day performance could elevate his draft standing and invite a team to gamble on his upside as a press cover man and special teams performer.
-------------------------
Marqueston_Huff 2543776 122
The Texas prep lettered in football and track and field. Arrived at Wyoming in 2010 and appeared in all 12 games as a true freshman, recording 18 tackles, one pass breakup and one interception. Saw action as a nickel back and on special teams. Moved into the lineup in '11 and started 13 games at cornerback, registering 47-2-3 with 2.5 tackles for loss and three fumble recoveries. Accounted for both of Wyoming's defensive scores, scooping up fumbles for TD runs of eight yards at Bowling Green and 48 yards at Air Force. Played in 12 games (10 starts) at cornerback in '12 and had 57-7-0 with 1.5 tackles for loss, two forced fumbles and one blocked extra-point attempt. Production blossomed after taking over the free safety role in '13, tallying 127-6-2 with three tackles for loss, one forced fumble and one blocked field goal attempt. Team captain.
Has very small hands. Gets lax with his technique. Inconsistent, subpar tackler as a safety. Average ball production. Performance is up and down -- tapered off as the season wound down.
Lean, athletic build. Fluid and sudden with terrific balance. Outstanding speed -- carries receivers vertically and flies around the field. Sudden plant and drive. Can elevate to contend in the air and make athletic interceptions. Does not hesitate to support the run. Scheme versatile. Sharp mentally. Three-year starter. Rose to the occasion against better competition and produced big against Nebraska.
Rounds 4-5
Fast, rangy, tough, loquacious defensive back who was pushed to play safety to fill a need in his senior season, and offers intriguing versatility on the back end. Projects ideally as a cornerback in the pros, where his explosiveness and physicality will appeal to a wide range of teams. Should contribute readily on special teams and has eventual starter potential.
-------------------------
Robert_Herron 2543777 185
Last name is pronounced "HUR-on." Los Angeles native who also starred on the track team as a prep, recording a 10.5-second 100 meters. As a true freshman in 2010, played 10 games (one start) and tallied six receptions for 57 yards (9.5-yard average) and zero touchdowns. Did not play against Utah (ankle) or Colorado State (concussion). Started 8-of-12 games played in '11, snagging 43-379-3 (8.8). Did not play against Boise and did not start the final two games against Colorado State and Temple. Started all eight games played in '12, managing 31-657-8 (21.2). Did not play against Toledo and Cal Poly because of a shin injury, then suffered a hamstring pull against Nevada and sat out against Air Force. Started all 12 games in '13 and hauled in 72-937-9 (13.0). Split his time between running back and receiver his first two seasons -- rushed 54 times in his career for 310 yards (5.7) and zero touchdowns.
Does not play fast. Marginal toughness -- does not like crossing the middle or extending across his frame. Drifts in his routes. Short-arms the ball. Does not adjust to or track the deep ball well. Lacks physical strength and is jarred on contact after the catch. Carries the ball loosely. Disinterested blocker, especially on the back side. Regularly matched up vs. inferior competition. Has been dinged a lot and long-term durability is a concern.
Good athlete. Exceptional straight-line timed speed -- can accelerate and get on top of DBs vertically. Quick-footed. Above-average hands. Has return capability (despite not being used as a returner because of offensive value).
Rounds 5-6
Very diminutive, outside receiver with the timed speed to threaten the field vertically and potentially contribute in the return game. Needs to prove he can bow up against better competition and is more than a track athlete.
-------------------------
Shaquille_Richardson 2543779 157
2013: Started all 13 games. Second on team with 3 INTs. 2012: Played in 13 games, starting 11. Led team with 14 PBUs. Had 1 INT. 2011: Played in 10 games, starting all 10. Led team with 4 INTs. 2010: Played in 13 games, starting 3. Recorded 2 INTs at Washington State in first career start. High School: Number 26 CB nationally (Scout).
Very lean build. Tends to squat on routes. Lacks eye discipline to sort out run-pass reads -- is late to locate the ball and support the run. Benched in 2012 for lapses in coverage and needs to become more consistent recognizing/supporting the run and securing open-field tackles. Marginal physicality. Character will invite close scrutiny -- was arrested on suspicion of felony theft as an incoming freshman and released from UCLA program.
Quick and agile and is aggressive jumping routes when he sees it. Can make spectacular plays look easy -- produced one of the most sensational highlight-reel plays of the season vs. Oregon when he acrobatically tipped the ball back into play to a teammate for an interception on the first play and closed the game with an interception of his own vs. Marcus Mariota to key a surprise upset. Outstanding pro day workout, posting a 4.43-second 40, 38 1/2-inch vertical jump and 6.95-second three-cone drill time, indicating good speed, agility and explosion.
Rounds 6-7
A lean, leggy, underdeveloped press corner who has shown big-time flashes but must prove more consistent in coverage, a greater willingness to tackle and more maturity than he demonstrated early in his career to be given an opportunity to compete.
-------------------------
Zach_Hocker 2543781 228
Led team with 104 points in 2010, connecting on 16 of 19 field-goal attempts with a long of 51 and all 56 extra-point tries. Broke the school record for points by a kicker in 2011 with 118 after making 21 of 27 FGs with a long of 50 and 55 of 57 PATs. Also kicked off 93 times for a 67.8-yard average with 40 touchbacks. In 2012, made 11 of 18 FGs with a long of 46 and all 32 PATs, and kicked off 58 times for a 64.7-yard average with 39 touchbacks. In 2013, hit on 13 of 15 FGs with a career long of 54 and all 28 PATs, and kicked off 50 times for a 63.2-yard average with 34 touchbacks. Also punted seven times for a 45.7-yard average with a long of 77 and one inside the 20-yard line. Led the Razorbacks in scoring each season and holds school records for points by a kicker (354), FG percentage (77.2), PATs made (171), PATs attempted (173) and field goals (61).
Thinly built and undersized. Does not possess a powerful leg. The ball does not explode off his foot (rise). Struggled to handle pressure early in his career.
Good leg speed. Consistently converted beyond 50 (3-4 as a senior) and has enough velocity to hang the ball on kickoffs. Well-grounded and humble.
Undrafted free agent
Soccer-style kicker whose leg strength and accuracy seemed to be weakening heading into his senior season, with diminished accuracy and range. Rebounded to make his senior season his best. Could warrant consideration in a camp.
-------------------------
Keith_Wenning 2543784 194
The Ohio prep had a 49-4 record as a starter and lettered in basketball and baseball. Saw action in all 12 games as a true freshman in 2010, starting the final 10, and completed 128 of 235 passes (54.5 percent) for 1,373 yards with 14 touchdowns and 14 interceptions.

Caught a 12-yard touchdown pass against Indiana. Missed the regular-season finale against Miami (OH) with a fractured right ankle but returned to start the Beef 'O' Brady Bowl. In 2013, became the first Ball State QB to throw for more than 4,000 yards in a season in after going 319-of-498 (64.1 percent) for 4,148 yards with 35 TDs and seven INTs in 13 starts. Set school career records for completions (1,035), attempts (1,642), passing yards (11,402) and touchdowns (92). Had 13 career rushing touchdowns and a 27-20 mark in 47 starts. Two-time team captain.
Average arm strength, athletic ability and pocket mobility to avoid the first wave and make throws off-balance and under duress. Carries a heavyness in his body and lacks twitch. Works almost exclusively out of the gun and will need to adapt to working from under center. Cannot easily manipulate his arm and throwing platform. Does not drive the deep out and accuracy and placement diminishes downfield. Production is inflated from regularly facing inferior MAC competition.
Experienced, four-year starter with a solid build. Very smart and understands the offense. Outstanding football character and personal character -- works at his craft, is driven to succeed and will represent a franchise well. Respected leader -- two-time team captain. Football is very improtant to him. Very tough and highly competitive. Has directed 10 fourth-quarter comebacks in his career. Consistent in his approach.
Round 7-Priority free agent
Heavy-bodied, dink-and-dunk, rhythm passer who could be challenged to fit the ball into tight NFL windows. Has the makeup desired in a Number 3 QB and could develop into a functional backup in a West Coast passing game.
-------------------------
Larry_Webster 2543786 136
His father, --NAME--, was an NFL defensive lineman from 1992-2002 with the Dolphins, Browns, Ravens and Jets. The Maryland native turned to football before the 2012 season after playing four years of basketball (2008-2012) for Bloomsburg, a Division II school in Pennsylvania. Finished his hoops career averaging 11.1 points and 7.2 rebounds per game and set a school record with 175 career blocked shots. Moved to the gridiron in the fall of 2012 and had 39 tackles, 15 tackles for loss and a school-record 13.5 sacks with two passes batted and one forced fumble in 12 games. Also caught two passes for eight yards and two touchdowns. Had nearly identical defensive statistics in 2013, tallying 49 tackles, 16 tackles for loss, 12.5 sacks with two passes batted and one forced fumble in 12 games. Was a finalist for the Cliff Harris Award, given annually to the top small-school defensive player.
Underdeveloped body. Tends to play too tall and can be run at and neutralized by power. Lacks weight-room strength and explosion and has not learned how to convert speed to power. Raw hand use -- is still learning how to disengage from blocks. Average eyes and instincts -- often late to locate the ball. Not a strong tackler and does not show knockback body power. Must adjust to facing better competition than he saw in the Pennsylvania State Athletics Conference.
Very good size-speed ratio. Can win at the snap with his natural bend, hip flexibility and initial take-off quickness. Closes fast to the ball. Has NFL pedigree. Has seen action as a goal-line receiving threat and effortlessly adjusts to the ball. Posted the second-fastest 40-yard dash time (4.58 seconds) of any defensive lineman at the NFL combine behind only Jadeveon Clowney and recorded a 36 1/2-inch vertical jump.
Rounds 4-5
A gifted athlete with NFL pedigree and intriguing developmental tools as a speed rusher, --NAME-- could prove to be better fit as a flex tight end in the pros, possessing more of an offensive temperament and the size, wingspan, athletic ability and coordination to create mismatches in a similar mold as Broncos TE Julius Thomas and Browns TE Jordan Cameron exiting college with limited football experience.
-------------------------
Charles_Leno_Jr. 2543788 246
High school offensive tackle-defensive end out Oakland, Calif., where he also lettered in basketball. Redshirted in 2009. Appeared in 10 games as a reserve in 2010. Started all 13 games at right tackle in 2011. Started all 26 games at left tackle 2012-13.
Lacks substance in pass protection and can be moved off a spot and walked back to the quarterback. Tends to bend at the waist, overextend and lose positioning -- average recovery speed. Carries his hands too low and does not shoot them with violence. Is stressed by speed and struggles to cut off the rush. Does not play strong and catches too much.
Outstanding arm length. Solid base in pass protection and can bump, steer and mirror. Understands fit and positioning. Can work up to the second level with ease. Flashes pop in his punch. Very durable, experienced three-year starter.
Rounds 5-6
Long-armed, soft-bodied college left tackle most ideally suited for a role as a versatile, swing backup in a zone-blocking scheme. Has not learned how to translate his athletic ability and explosion to the field, yet possesses enough length, agility and untapped talent to find a role for a patient offensive line coach. Could warrant interest inside as a guard or center where he has help on each side. Similar to Packers OT Marshall Newhouse.
-------------------------
Matt_Hazel 2543792 190
Prepped in South Carolina. As a true freshman in 2010, played 11 games (three starts) and caught 20 balls for 276 yards (13.8-yard average) and five touchdowns.

Led the Chanticleers in receiving his final three seasons. Owns CCU career and single-season receptions records. Was the third player in school history to participate in the East-West Shrine Game, joining Jerome Simpson (Vikings) and Josh Norman (Panthers).
Not physically strong with a lean body build, small hands and short arms. Can be knocked off routes by tight press coverage. Average strength and elusiveness after the catch. Looks for a landing spot before contact (hears footsteps). Alligator arms appear in traffic and bodies the ball along the sideline. Shows some tightness in his body coming out of breaks and routes could use more refinement.
Good functional football-playing speed. Accelerates off the line and can create separation. Tracks the deep ball well, contorts his body in the air and can make difficult catches look easy. Can create after the catch and make the first defender miss on bubble screens out of the slot. Willing blocker -- displays surprising toughness for his size to mix it up with linebackers. Fared well vs. better competiition (see South Carolina). Comes from a very supportive family and has strong personal and football character. The game is very important to him.
Round 7-Priority free agent
A smooth, fluid, athletic small-school receiver with the hands, body control and concentration to earn a roster spot and develop into a solid contributor.
-------------------------
Crockett_Gillmore 2543794 99
Receiver-defensive end who also wrestled, played basketball and ran track as a Texas prep. As a true freshman in 2010, injuries to other players forced a switch from tight end to defensive end in August ' tallied 11 tackles, two for loss and a sack in nine games played (wore jersey Number 99). Moved back to tight end during 2011 spring practice and was the Rams' leading receiver in 2011, when he started all 12 games and recorded 45 receptions for 468 yards (10.4-yard average) and four touchdowns. Started 10 of 11 games played in 2012, managing 19-263-2 (13.8). Did not play against Hawaii (torn left labrum). Started all 14 games in 2013 and caught 47-577-2 (12.3). Did not lift at the combine because of a strained left elbow.
Underdeveloped lower body with limited overall weight-room strength. Not a nuanced route runner to create separation and lacks polish releasing off the line (pinballed too easily). Limited suddeness and burst out of his breaks. Marginal creativity after the catch. Lacks top-end speed to threaten the seam. Has been a bit of a china doll and long-term durability requires evaluation. Recorded a 1.77-second 10-yard time, tied for slowest among tight ends at the combine.
Has a good compact frame with long arms and big hands. Chippy, competitive blocker -- latches on and plays through the whistle. Good finisher. Natural hands catcher. Catches in a crowd and will shake off a hit and run through contact. Rises to a challenge and matched up well as a base blocker vs. Alabama's Adrian Hubbard. Functional positional, pass protector. Very durable.
Rounds 6-7
A try-hard, developmental blocker capable of catching on as a Number 3 tight end with continued improvement in the weight room. Possesses above-average base blocking ability, hands and foot speed to carve a role.
-------------------------
Zach_Moore 2543796 198
Has a daughter. Prepped in the Chicago Public League but was not a Division I qualifier and landed at Division II Concordia-St. Paul in Minnesota. As a true freshman in 2009, played in eight games (one start) and recorded 16 tackles, three tackles for loss and two sacks with one forced fumble. Moved into the starting lineup in 2010 and had 42 tackles, 12 tackles for loss and 10 sacks with one forced fumble in nine games. Was academically ineligible in 2011. Returned to start 11 games in 2012, tallying 39 tackles, 21 tackles for loss and 14 sacks with one pass batted, one interception and two forced fumbles. In 2013, registered 33 tackles, 9.5 tackles for loss and seven sacks with three passes batted and two forced fumbles in 11 starts. Was a finalist for the Cliff Harris Division II Player of the Year Award. Two-time captain was the first Concordia player to be invited to the NFL combine.
Needs to get functionally stronger. Still learning to convert speed to power and does not physically dominate marginal competition. Green eyes and instincts to locate and diagnose. Plays too tall and needs to learn how to grow roots defending the run. Washed by double teams. Hand use and pass-rush moves need to be developed. Will be a 24-year-old rookie.
Looks the part with NFL stature, length and musculature. Is athletic and flexible and has rare leaping ability for his size. Quick off the snap. Flashes the ability to gain extension and play off blocks. Gives effort in pursuit and ranges to make tackles. Good closing speed. Snares ball carriers. Averaged a sack per game in college. Has experience in a 4-3 and 3-4. Dedicated, hardworking and coachable two-time captain. Mentally tough guy who has beaten the odds and persevered to get to this point. Has moldable tools and upside.
Rounds 4-5
Raw, physically gifted, Division II standout with untapped potential given his combination of size, length and movement skills. Will have defensive line coaches drooling in workouts, and has the dimensions and athleticism to warrant consideration as a draftable, developmental investment with positional versatility to play defensive end or three-technique in an even front or five-technique in an odd front. Could be tried as a linebacker.
-------------------------
Ross_Cockrell 2543799 109
High school cornerback-receiver who also played basketball and ran track as a North Carolina prep. After redshirting in 2009, he made his collegiate debut in 2010 and started 12 games at cornerback, recording 60 tackles, seven pass breakups and a team-high three interceptions. Made 11 starts in 2011, recording 56 tackles, nine pass breakups and one interception with one tackle for loss. Missed one game with a leg injury. Tallied 71 tackles, 13 pass breakups and five interceptions with four tackles for loss, one sack and one forced fumble in 2012 (13 starts).

In 2013, made 13 starts and recorded 46 tackles, 12 pass breakups and three interceptions with two tackles for loss, one sack and one forced fumble. Missed one game with an ankle injury. Team captain. Concluded his career as Duke's all-time leader in interceptions (12) and pass breakups (41).
Has small hands, short arms and a thin frame, especially in the lower body. Limited press strength to match up against bigger receivers. Often plays to the boundary. Has some tightness in his hips that shows re-directing -- allows separation at the break point. Does not step up and take on blocks and overall game lacks physicality.
Plays smart and has a good feel for the game -- eyes, anticipation and awarenesss. Plays with discipline and takes a consistent approach. Good route recognition. Lines up in the slot and is quick and agile enough to handle dynamic receivers. Sorts through route combinations and maintains positioning. Good leaping ability -- competes for the ball in the air. Has jammer experience on special teams.
Rounds 3-4
Good-sized, smart, ballhawking zone corner who plays fast and could bring immediate value as a nickel back and contribute on special teams.
-------------------------
Jimmy_Garoppolo 2543801 62
The Illinois prep started the final eight games of his true freshman season in 2010, completing 124 of 211 passes (58.8 percent) for 1,639 yards with 14 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Made all 11 starts in 2011, going 217-of-349 for 2,644 with 20 TDs and 14 INTs. Went 331-of-540 (61.3 percent)for 3,823 yards with 31 TDs and 15 INTs in 12 starts in 2012. Named the Walter Payton Award winner, given to top player in FCS, in 2013 after going 375-of-568 (66.0 percent) for 5,050 yards with 53 TDs and nine INTs in 14 contests. Threw for 450 yards and six touchdowns in the Panthers' only regular-season loss, to Northern Illinois. Is one of only two quarterbacks to throw for more than 5,000 yards in a season (Taylor Heinicke, 2012) in FCS history. Was named the Offensive MVP of the East-West Shrine Game. Had eight career rushing touchdowns and a 23-22 record in 45 starts.
Is a tad undersized with small hands and short arms. Uses a three-quarters delivery that could lead to batted balls. Works heavily out of the shotgun in a spread offense, and footwork could require adjustment to working from under center. Does not always feel pressure in the pocket. Does not rip the deep out or drive the ball with high RPMs. Undershoots and often hangs the deep ball. Makes receivers work for the ball downfield, and deep accuracy could stand to improve. Makes a lot of simple, one-look reads and was not heavily challenged by consistent pressure or complex looks in the Ohio Valley Conference.
Has a very quick trigger and good wrist snap that translates to a smooth throwing motion and clean, compact delivery (no windup). Lightning release quickness. Urgent decision maker. Sells play-action. Athletic enough to slide in the pocket and buy time with his feet while keeping his eyes downfield. Good anticipation -- throws his receivers open. Can change ball speeds and drop it in a bucket. Does not take unnecessary sacks and will dump the ball. Will deliver the ball looking down the barrel of a gun. Tough-minded and poised in the pocket -- can withstand a hit and pop back up. Highly competitive. Smart, respected, vocal team leader. Very durable, experienced, four-year starter. Good football intelligence.
Round 2
A decorated FCS passer, --NAME-- could excite quarterback coaches with his quick delivery, mental make-up and work habits, yet he still needs to prove he can fit the ball into tight windows and do more than carve up soft shells the way he regularly did on his way to a record-breaking performance in college. Possesses the physical tools to eventually earn an NFL starting job in a rhythm passing game with continued refinement but is more of a caretaker than a game changer and will require some patience adapting to the NFL game.
-------------------------
Dakota_Dozier 2543805 137
Two-way lineman who also wrestled as a California prep. Redshirted in 2009. Manned left tackle all four years for the Paladins. In 2010, became the first freshman offensive lineman to start in 14 years, starting 10 of 11 games. Suffered a sprained ankle against The Citadel and did not start against Wofford. Started all 11 games in 2011. Started all nine games played in 2012 ' sprained his left MCL against Chattanooga and sat out against Georgia Southern and Elon. Healthy in 2013, started all 14 games. Team captain.
Raw technician. Footwork is not clean. Shuffles instead of kicksliding and can get overextended attacking defenders. Carries his hands low and does not replace them. Oversets and gives up inside counters. Rolls slowly to the second level under control and can be beaten to the block point by speed. Can get complacent and play down to the competition level.
Outstanding overall body mass and thickness, especially in the lower body. Strong power base with a very stout anchor. Locks down and dominates lesser competition in pass protection (pancake machine). Plays with vinegar and finishes blocks. Rose to the occasion vs. better competition (see LSU). Plays with good knee bend and generates movement off the ball. Experienced, four-year starter.
Rounds 3-4
Small-school college left tackle best suited to kick inside in the pros. Has the girth and enough athletic ability to compete as a guard or center and ornery football disposition desired in the trenches. A tough, gritty, road grader capable of paving the way in the run game, --NAME-- will require some technique refinement in pass protection, yet possesses clear starter potential with continued development. Draft status could ascend if he proves he can play center.
-------------------------
Jemea_Thomas 2543808 206
Prepped in Georgia, where he was the Class AA Defensive Player of the Year. Also ran track. Began 2009 fall camp as a running back before switching to defensive back and recording 10 tackles, no pass breakups and no interceptions while playing in all 14 games. Redshirted in 2010 because of poor grades. Appeared in all 13 games with two starts (Clemson, Utah) in 2011 and managed 50 tackles, six pass breakups and three interceptions with four tackles for loss, two sacks and one forced fumble. Took over the punt returner job for the last five contests, returning three punts for 31 yards (10.3-yard average). Led the team in interceptions in 2012, logging 86 tackles, six pass breakups and four interceptions with three tackles for loss while making all 14 starts, the first five games at CB and the last nine at safety. In 2013, had team-leading 88 tackles and eight pass breakups along with two interceptions, 6.5 tackles for loss, three sacks and two forced fumbles in 13 starts. Played in 54 career games to tie the school record and saw action at every position in the secondary. Had nine career kickoff returns for 204 yards (22.7-yard average). Strained a back muscle bench pressing at the combine and did not do drills.
Lacks ideal height and has short arms. Frame is nearly maxed out. Stiff hips. Gives up some ground and allows separation in man coverage vs. quickness. Easily mismatched by size vs. tight ends. Average range -- lacks desirable length and fluidity to patrol the back end. Hands are iffy.
Has large hands and is strong for his size. Sacrifices his body and supports the run willingly; he likes contact. Takes good angles and understands run-game fits. Quietly confident. Mentally and physically tough. Good short-area zone awareness; reacting to throws in front of him is a strength. Tough and durable, will play hurt. Highly respected. Hardworking and accountable. Experienced four-year starter.
Rounds 6-7
Strong, tough, durable, downhill box safety whose hip tightness is limiting, but he brings desirable grit, physicality and competitiveness and could latch on as a situational nickel-safety and special-teams player.

Ted_Bolser 2543810 217
John Mackey Award semifinalist in 2013.  Set IU TE career records with 117 receptions, 1,337 yards, 15 TDs. 2013: Honorable mention All-Big Ten. Back-to-back 2-plus TD games vs. Indiana State, Navy. 2012: Started all 12 games. Finished fourth on the team with 41 receptions. 2011: Played all 12 games, starting 6. Had 54 yds, 1 TD vs. Penn State. 2010: Played all 12 games, starting 7. Set school records in receptions, yards and TD for freshman TE. 2009: Redshirted. High School: Number 41 TE in nation (Rivals). 63 receptions, 845 yards, 11 TDs as senior in Ohio.
Has very small hands and short arms. Lumbering mover. One-speed route runner with minimal burst and acceleration to separate. Much of his production is schemed -- creates little on his own. Can be phased by traffic (hears footsteps) -- hands are suspect. Struggles sustaining blocks (falls off and is controlled too easily). Tends to play tall and upright. Bench-pressed 225 pounds only 19 times at his pro day.
Good size and enough strength to fend off the jam. Catches outside his frame and adjusts to the ball. Has a wide catching radius and presents a big target.
Priority free agent
Could battle for a roster spot as a short-area receiving target. Aligns in the backfield, in the slot and on the line, yet offers little as a blocker.

Pierre_Desir 2543811 127
Married with two daughters. A native of Port Au Prince, Haiti, he emigrated to the St. Louis area with his parents when he was 4. In January 2010, his grandfather and an eight-month-old cousin were among those killed in the earthquakes that devastated Haiti.

Was the 2013 winner of the Cliff Harris Award, given to the nation's top small college defensive back, after recording 33 tackles, eight pass breakups and four INTs with one tackle for loss and one forced fumble. Earned invitations to the East-West Shrine Game and the Senior Bowl.
Average timed speed. Loses a half-step in transition and will struggle to carry NFL receivers vertically. Does not consistently play to his size as a run defender. Could stand to do a better job wrapping as a tackler and filling faster -- does not always play to his size in the run game. Production was inflated by marginal competition.
Outstanding body and arm length. Explosive athlete whose 11-foot, 1-inch broad jump was second-best at the combine. Has loose hips and a fluid pedal. Superb two-year production on the ball. Natural interceptor -- attacks the ball in the air like a receiver and tracks it very well. Plays big in critical situations. Very confident demeanor. Outstanding zone instincts -- sees patterns developing and jumps routes. Solid tackler. Mature and accountable. Experienced, four-year starter. Demonstrated toughness to play hurt.
Rounds 3-4
Exceptional-sized zone cover man who was a big fish in a small pond as a Division II standout, though he did not look out of place at the Senior Bowl. Size, ball skills and anticipation will appeal to teams such as Seattle, Jacksonville and Tampa Bay.
-------------------------
Justin_Ellis 2543812 107
Lettered for three years in football and track, competing in the shot put, as a Louisiana prep. Redshirted in 2009. During camp in 2010, he cracked a bone in his left foot and missed the first eight games of the season. Appeared in each of the final four contests and had four tackles, one-half tackle for loss and no sacks. Was Louisiana Tech's starting nose tackle in 2011, recording 29 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss and one sack with one pass batted in 13 games (11 starts). During the season, he had his right shoulder scoped, although he didn't miss any action.

Recorded his best college season as a senior in 2013, starting all 12 games and tallying 48 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss and 1.5 sacks with one pass batted.
Short with short limbs and a lot of extra concentrated weight in his midsection. Limited athlete. Tires easily and tends to stand straight up and get caught on blocks (marginal extension). Does not show violence in his hands. Is not a pass rusher. Has missed time with foot and ankle injuries associated with excessive weight that he has struggled maintaining.
Good anchor strength. Is seldom inverted or moved off a spot. Can stack the line and occupy blockers.
Rounds 4-5
Round-bodied, short-armed plugger with enough anchor strength to hold the point and clog the middle on a shade in a 4-3 front. Must prove he can manage his weight and stay healthy to earn a spot in the NFL.
-------------------------
Preston_Brown 2543814 73
Cincinnati native. Appeared in all 13 games in 2010 and recorded 10 tackles, one tackle for loss and one sack. Played strongside linebacker in 2011, starting 11 of 13 games and producing 84 tackles, five tackles for loss and 1.5 sacks.

Was the Cardinals' leading tackler for the second straight season in 2013, amassing 98 tackles, 12.5 tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks with a pass breakup, three forced fumbles and a 48-yard fumble return touchdown.
Shows some tightness in his movement. Struggles to carry backs and match up with athletic tight ends in man coverage. Limited depth in coverage drops -- is best in small areas. Average coverage instincts. Requires some motivation.
Outstanding size. Physical tackler. Steps downhilll and attacks the run with the proper shoulder. Good eyes and instincts. Delivers some pop on contact and strikes with force. Experienced three-year starter. Good football intelligence -- makes the calls and lines up a defense. Has large hands and a big wing span for his size.
Rounds 4-5
Aggressive, high-collision 'Mike' linebacker best paired with a demanding position coach who will extract the most from him. Could be most ideally suited as a two-down thumper vs. the run.
-------------------------
Laurent_Duvernay-Tardif 2543816 200
Quebec native. Played as a defensive lineman in 2010, starting three of six games played. Converted to offensive tackle and started all 26 games from 2011-13. Two-time team captain bulked up approximately 65 pounds since his freshman season. Won the prestigious J.P. Metras Trophy as the most outstanding lineman in Canada (CIS). Also received the Forbes Trophy as McGill University's male athlete of the year. Honored with McGill University's 1938 Champions Award for combining leadership with athletic prowess and academic excellence. Has designs on being a doctor; maintained a perfect 4.0 GPA in the faculty of medicine, and the coaching staff reduced his practice commitments in order to accommodate his stringent academic workload. Is rated as the top prospect in the 2014 Canadian Football League draft, according to the CFL Scouting Bureau. Participated in the East-West Shrine Game.
Raw technician. Lunges overagressively and loses positioning. Can learn to play under more control and take better angles. Average recovery speed vs. inside counters. Lets defenders into his body and does not replace his hands -- slow to reload after initial strike (though he was playing through a shoulder injury). Will need to adjust to playing a yard off the ball (Canadian rules) and getting into blocks more quickly.
Looks the part with outstanding upper-body strength and massive quads. Stout anchor in pass protection. Violent shock in his punch. Plays with a nasty temperament and seeks to bury defenders into the ground. Aggressive run blocker -- runs his feet on contact and plays beyond the whistle. Is physically and mentally tough and will play through pain (fought through a torn left labrum injury as a senior and never took himself out of a game or missed time). Highly intelligent (in medical program) and football smart. Can take concepts from the board to the field.
Rounds 3-4
Tough, gritty, smart battler who transformed from an impactful 250-pound three-technique as a freshman. Made a successful conversion to left tackle as a sophomore and has grown to be a dominating Canadian 315-pound left tackle expected to be the first pick of the CFL draft. Projects best inside in the pros and could prove to be the best product delivered from Canada's developmental system since Israel Idonije. Will require refinement, but has the physical tools and temperament that cannot be taught.
-------------------------
Jeremy_Gallon 2543818 244
Two-time all-state selection who played quarterback, running back and safety as a Florida prep. Redshirted in 2009.

Set a Big Ten single-game record for receiving yards when he posted 14 catches for 369 yards and two TDs against Indiana. Also had 16 career rushes for 102 yards (6.4) and no touchdowns.
Short with a limited catching radius. Lacks top-end speed to separate vertically or run away from a crowd (consistently tracked down from behind). Not a natural hands catcher and will often body the ball. Lacks dynamic run skills for an undersized receiver. Much of his production results from schemed bubble screens and lateral tosses. Underpowered blocker. Will be a 24-year-old rookie.
Fine route savvy to read coverage and uncover in zones. Good hand-eye coordination. Runs hard with good balance and vision after the catch. Outstanding production. Identifies with the game and is very passionate about it. Has return experience.
Rounds 5-6
Stocky, strong slot receiver with more of a running back's build, --NAME-- possesses the hands, zone awareness and toughness to fend for a job in the pros. Lacks the top-end speed desired as a kick returner, but shows enough burst to warrant an opportunity fielding punts.
-------------------------
Brock_Vereen 2543820 131
His father, Henry, was drafted by Tampa Bay before going to the Canadian Football League, and his brother, Shane, is a running back for the New England Patriots. --NAME-- was a defensive back-running back who also ran track as a California prep.

Logged 59-6-1 with 2 1/2 tackles for loss and one forced fumble. Started all 13 games ' the first six games at safety and the last seven at cornerback.
Has tiny hands, short arms and lacks overall bulk. Does not have ideal length to match up with NFL tight ends in coverage. Not an explosive hitter or forceful tackler. Hands are suspect -- smothers the ball and has just four career interceptions. Long-term durability could be a concern.
Very good athlete with fluid movement skills and good range. Competes hard. Runs the alley and can negotiate traffic. Good zone awareness and route recognition. Understands angles and leverage. Can carry receivers in man coverage with little wasted movement in transition on speed turns. Good leaping ability. Very smart, motivated, team player with a passion for the game. Can line up the defense. Outstanding work ethic. Contributes as a gunner on special teams. Has NFL pedigree. His 25 bench-press reps were most among DBs at the combine, and his 4.07-second short shuttle was second among safeties.
Rounds 3-4
Intelligent, athletic, rangy free safety with desirable strength and cover skills to go along with football bloodlines. Needs to improve against the run but is instinctive and brings terrific intangibles that could propel him into a role as a starter and defensive leader.

Started all 13 games at LT in 2011.

Started all 14 games at LT in 2013.
Operates out of a 2-point stance in a spread-option offense. Falls off blocks and does not finish. Very average sustain. Limited body control and recovery speed. Late to reach the block point on the second level. Does not create movement in the run game. Gives too much ground in pass protection.
Solid build with a stout base and long torso. Quick enough to cut off the outside rush and give help where it is needed. Recognizes the blitz and displays good enough agility to adjust to movement. Good work ethic. Very good weight-room strength -- cleans nearly 400 pounds.
Rounds 6-7
College left tackle with enough length and foot quickness to handle the blind side in a pinch, but is more ideally suited for the right side and could be best suited for a swing backup role. Has played nearly every position on the line and could add depth as a positional, wall-off blocker.
-------------------------
Quincy_Enunwa 2543828 209

Lacks elite top-end speed to separate vertically. Shows some hip tightness. Is not fluid or sudden out of breaks (wastes steps). Not a natural catcher -- lets throws into his body, double catches some and drops catchable throws.
Looks the part with terrific size, long arms and an NFL musculature. Can elevate and snatch throws above his head. Strong after the catch. Sheer size and brawn to block out corners outside. Has hustle traits. Knows where the sticks are and is very football smart. Excellent intangibles -- team captain with a professional approach and leadership traits. Was a 21-year-old senior.
Rounds 6-7
Big, tough, athletic, West Coast receiver who broke out as a senior. Has a mixture of "Z" and "X" traits and could even be viewed as a developmental H-back prospect.
-------------------------

Limited range -- does not explode off the hash or cover enough ground with the ball in the air. Takes some inaccurate angles and struggles to break down in space. Selective hitter and inconsistent tackler in general. Personality could clash with some people.
Can secure tackles in the box when he has a clear path. Drops downhill quickly and can slip into short hole. Vocal leader of secondary. Three-year starter with experience at safety and corner.
Rounds 5-6
Converted cornerback and free/strong safety tweener whose statistical production might be his best resume builder. Uneven performer whose average athleticism, questionable physicality and immaturity will turn teams off. Will have to turn heads on special teams to have longevity as a backup.
-------------------------
Bennett_Jackson 2543834 187
Receiver-defensive back who also competed in sprints and hurdles as a New Jersey prep. Arrived at Notre Dame as a wide receiver in 2010 and saw action in 13 games as a true freshman.

Intriguing height and athletic ability. A former WR, he has good hands to intercept. Demonstrated explosion and lateral agility at the combine, recording impressive marks in the vertical jump (38 inches), broad jump (10 feet, 8 inches) and 20-yard shuttle (4.00 seconds). Tough and durable. Has special-teams experience. Has leadership traits and solid football and personal character.
Rounds 4-5
Looks the part and has developmental value given his athleticism and desirable makeup, but did not take a significant step forward as a senior. Has traits to contribute initially on special teams while he works on becoming a more well-rounded cornerback.

Large hands. Good balance and knee bend. Strong and physical -- can stuff tight ends and is surprisingly robust at the point of attack. Flows laterally and pursues to the boundary. Strong tackler. Flashes power-leverage potential. Effective stunting and looping. Operated from 2- and 3-point stance and played on special teams.
Rounds 4-5
Thickly built, high-motor, highly competitive edge defender who projects best as a left outside linebacker in a 3-4 scheme. Lacks desirable dimensions, flexibility and finishing speed, but has more than enough play strength, tenacity and toughness to compensate.

Lacks ideal size. Has very short arms and small hands. Limited functional strength. Can be jammed and rerouted. Can be outmuscled for contested catches. Cannot bust through tackles. Poor blocker. Will be a 24-year-old rookie.
Athletic and flexible. Accelerates off the line. Field fast. Stretches the field and tracks deep throws. Gets in and out of breaks quickly. Good hands. Playmaking ability as a receiver and return man. Has worked as a gunner. Well respected, coachable team captain. Led all receivers at the combine with a 2.46-second time in the 20-yard split.
Rounds 6-7
Lean, fluid, speedy Division II standout with a playmaker's resume. Will have to overcome size and strength limitations, but his burst and hands give him the opportunity to earn a role as a slot receiver and return man.

Ricardo_Allen 2543850 147
Also participated in soccer and track as a Florida prep. Started all 12 games at left cornerback as a true freshman for Purdue in 2010, recording 73 tackles, four pass breakups and three interceptions with 3.5 tackles for loss and one sack.

Team captain. Saw action in all 50 possible games during his Purdue career, finishing with 13 interceptions, the second-highest total in school history.
Undersized and at a physical disadvantage vs. bigger receivers. Limited functional strength. Is not equipped to press and or tackle forcefully. Inconsistent run support. Below-average timed speed. Eyes get stuck in the backfield. Vulnerable to quarterback manipulation and double moves. Average transitional quickness. Allows too big of a cushion.
Athletic with fluid movement skills. Plants and drives with urgency and shows good closing burst. Showed a knack for making plays, returning four of 13 career INTs for TDs. Active and energetic. Durable four-year starter. Solid personal and football character.
Rounds 6-7
Short, lean-framed, battle-tested corner who lacks exceptional athletic traits and will always have physical limitations but has enough competitiveness and ball skills to compete for a spot as a reserve.
-------------------------
Phillip_Gaines 2543851 87
Also lettered in track as a Texas prep. Played in nine games as a true freshman 2009 (starting four times at field corner and twice at boundary corner) and had 31 tackles, three pass breakups and zero interceptions with one tackle for loss.

Was suspended for the season opener for an undisclosed violation of team rules. Set a school record with his 38 career pass breakups.
Durability is a concern. Has been dinged up. Underdeveloped and underpowered. Does not play to timed speed. Not equipped to handle man-to-man responsibility. Poor run supporter and tackler. Does not project as a core special-teams player. Tweener traits.
Nice length. Terrific timed speed, blazing sub-4.4 times at the combine. Can be deployed in zone coverage. Plays the pocket. Good production on the ball, with 35 passes defended the last two seasons. Tough and competitive. Is hardworking and well respected by coaches and teammates. Recorded second-quickest three-cone drill among cornerbacks at the combine (6.62 seconds).
Rounds 4-5
Lean, active zone corner whose ball skills will have to carry him. Could earn a roster spot on pure measurables but lacks desirable functional speed, strength and physicality.
-------------------------
Bene_Benwikere 2543855 148
His cousin Chris Owens has played cornerback in the NFL with Atlanta, Cleveland and Miami. Prepped in California, where he won a state championship, played basketball and ran track. Had arthroscopic surgery in high school to repair his right MCL. Played safety in his freshman year at San Jose State in 2010, appearing in 13 games (nine starts) and recording 74 tackles, four pass breakups and one interception with 1.5 tackles for loss and two forced fumbles. Saw most of his action at cornerback in 2011 and appeared in 10 games (two starts), posting 18 tackles, three pass breakups and one INT with one-half tackle for loss. Also caught one pass for 11 yards. Played the second half of the campaign with an injured right wrist and underwent arthroscopic surgery after the season. In 2012, played in 13 games (eight starts) and recorded 67 tackles, four pass breakups and seven INTs with 7.5 tackles for loss and one forced fumble. Began the year seeing action in nickel coverages before starting the last seven games of the season. Tied a school record with a three-interception performance against Louisiana Tech.

In 2013, totaled 55 tackles, 11 pass breakups and five INTs with two tackles for loss and one sack in 11 starts. Missed one game with a concussion. Concluded his career with a school-record 14 interceptions.
Needs to spend more time in the weight room -- pushed 225 pounds just 10 times at the combine. Could stand to improve his tackling. Below-average timed speed; struggled matching with the explosive vertical speed of Stanford WR Ty Montgomery. Production inflated by lesser competition.
Good size. Excellent ball skills -- plays the ball in the air like a receiver. Competes in the air, can highpoint the ball and snag INTs with his hands. Quick to read run and pass. Has special-teams experience, including as a gunner and jammer. Good football intelligence. Demonstrated secondary versatility -- has played corner, safety and nickel back.
Rounds 4-5
More smooth than fast. Ballhawking nickel corner who is more effective as a pass defender than run supporter. His game lacks physicality, yet his zone cover skills could allow him to carve a role in the slot and on special teams. Would benefit from a demanding position coach. Compares very favorably to Titans third-round pick and recently signed Buccaneer Alterraun Verner.
-------------------------
Tyler_Starr 2543857 255
Engaged with a son. Prepped at a small school in Iowa, where he won a state basketball championship and went to three state title games in football.

Small hands. Limited core strength and knockback power. Not stout. Unrefined hand use. Does not have a plan as a pass rusher.
Good athletic ability and acceleration. Can run with tight ends in coverage. Good pursuit effort -- chases hard and flattens down the line. Productive three-year starter.
Round 7-Priority free agent
Athletic, productive, raw rush linebacker prospect who could also be tried as a Sam linebacker. Needs to develop more core strength, improve technically and make his mark on special teams to warrant developmental consideration.
-------------------------
Jay_Bromley 2543860 74
Has overcome many obstacles in life. Was not raised by his biological parents, and his grandmother, who took care of him for the first 13 years of his life, died the summer before he started high school. The New York prep earned four letters in football and a scholarship from Syracuse. Appeared in 12 games as a true freshman in 2010 and had eight tackles. Played in 12 games in 2011, including 10 starts at defensive tackle, and had 32 tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss and 1.5 sacks.

Led the team in tackles for loss and sacks. Team captain.
Small hands. Pad level fluctuates. Average eyes and diagnostic ability. Does not play with pop or power in his hands to shock or discard blockers. Moved by double teams. Bland pass rusher (inflated sack numbers). Has tweener traits. Tepid intensity level -- could use more glass in his diet.
Good combination of size and movement skills. Flashes quick get-off and the ability to hold his ground against the run. Can work half a man, get skinny enough to penetrate the gap and closes with some steam when he has a direct bead on the QB. Is active and gives effort in pursuit. Strong tackler when he's able to wrap up ball carriers. Coachable, hardworking.
Rounds 4-5
Well-built, inconsistent interior defender with enough strength, athleticism and pass-rush ability to contribute in a rotational role. Best fits as a 4-3 defensive tackle, but could appeal to teams running a hybrid scheme given his potential to be used as a five-technique.
-------------------------
Zach_Fulton 2543862 193
His brother, Xavier, played at Illinois, was drafted in the fifth round of the 2009 draft by the Buccaneers and currently plays in the CFL. Prepped in suburban Chicago.

Suffered high ankle sprain, MCL sprain and bone bruise to his left leg against Alabama, forcing him to sit out against South Carolina. Started all 12 games in 2013.
Does not breathe fire or impose his will. Still learning how to generate power through his core. Has heavy legs and could stand to improve footwork. Is a soft puncher and tends to overextend. Needs to improve grip strength and sustain. Struggles to engage linebackers in space. Awareness is lacking -- not ideally suited to shift to center. Struggles to connect with moving targets. Has a history of ankle injuries. Recorded the slowest 20-yard shuttle (5.18 seconds) of any combine participant.
Looks the part with good overall size and mass. Strong enough to anchor in pass protection. Flashes thump on contact and ability to down block and seal run lanes. Started 40 games in the SEC and has experience locking horns with NFL-caliber defensive tackles. Has raw traits to develop. Coachable pleaser and will appeal to offensive line coaches. Good teammate.
Rounds 4-5
Physically impressive, moldable right guard prospect with a good soldier's attitude to go along with untapped physical ability, though his tape falls short of his intangibles at this stage of his development. Could be a pet project for an offensive line coach confident he can turn --NAME-- into an effective mauler.
-------------------------
Cassius_Marsh 2543868 108
His father, Curtis Sr., was a receiver who played 15 games with the Jaguars and Steelers (1995-97). His brother, Curtis, is a cornerback with the Eagles. Raised by single mother and prepped at Westlake Village (Calif.) Oaks Christian. Originally committed to LSU but switched to UCLA to remain close to home.

Also caught a touchdown pass as a tight end. Was benched against Stanford after he was ejected from the Cal contest (after being called for offside penalties on consecutive plays, he threw a punch mid-play in response to a Cal blocker extending a high, two-handed punch to --NAME--'s head off the snap). Pulled out of the East-West Shrine Game after hurting his wrist in practice. Was nearly 300 pounds as a freshman, but played around 260 as an upperclassman.
Lacks ideal foot speed to outquick left tackles. Could stand to improve weight-room strength and functional core strength. Is tightly wound and will rise out of his stance and play tall. Can be overly emotional, lose focus and play undisciplined (too many errors). Will require a strong positional coach.
Outstanding effort and field energy. Good pursuit production -- flattens and chases. Plays past the whistle and keeps working to come free. Sacrifices his body around piles. Flushes production to teammates. Flashes strength and power on the edge. Uses his hands well to control and shed blockers. Emotional leader who plays with intensity. Tough and durable. Has NFL pedigree (father and brother). Versatile and can line up inside and outside. Has contributed as a tight end.
Rounds 4-5
Very active, high-motor, steady, consistent producer. Lacks ideal bulk for the inside and speed to work the edges, but can set the edge and bring value to an odd front in a LOLB role or as a Sam linebacker. Is most natural moving forward piercing gaps. Will need to be managed, needs to cut down on errors and must learn to play within the structure of the defense.
-------------------------
Devon_Kennard 2543869 174
His father, Derek, was an 11-year NFL offensive lineman with the Cardinals, Saints and Cowboys (1986-96). --NAME-- was a USA Today All-American as an Arizona prep.

Deployed as an outside linebacker in defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast's 3-4 scheme in 2013, when he started all 14 games and had 60 tackles, 13.5 tackles for loss and nine sacks with four pass breakups. Team captain had the top GPA on the team and was honored as USC's Most Inspirational Player and Co-Lifter of the Year.
Lacks ideal body length and has small hands. Average athletic ability. Dull get-off. Limited explosion and power. Needs to cultivate pass-rush moves. Does not provide enough resistance against the run. Still developing instincts. Non-explosive athlete with pedestrian agility, as evidenced by poor 30-inch vertical and 7.25-second three-cone marks.
Well-proportioned, muscular build. Generally plays on his feet. Can drop into short zones. Good tackler. Has played outside linebacker, middle linebacker and defensive end. Smart and tough. Team captain with outstanding intangibles, including leadership traits and a professional approach.
Round 7-Priority free agent
A well-put-together standup linebacker with NFL bloodlines, --NAME--'s intangibles outdistance his physical traits, as he lacks the juice to consistently heat up the edge in the pros.
-------------------------
Nevin_Lawson 2543872 133
The Kingston, Jamaica, native was a starter at cornerback and running back as a Florida prep. Also lettered as a sprinter in track.

In 2013, totaled 57 tackles, 13 pass breakups and four INTs in 14 games (13 starts). Had his first career two-interception game against Boise State, returning one for a 65-yard score.
Press technique needs refinement. Too often allows free release. Clutching, grabbing and incurring flags have been issues in the past. Ball skills are a work in progress. Leaves some production on the field. Inconsistent run supporter. Struggled to contain USC WR Marqise Lee.
Muscular build with nice arm length. Plays with his eyes. Reads and reacts quickly. Has skills to man up receivers. Soft-footed with flexible hips to pedal easily and transition smoothly. Good zone awareness and reactions. Productive on the ball. Effective blitzer. Has special-teams experience as a gunner and jammer. Durable three-year starter. Has matured and taken a more professional approach as an upperclassman.
Round 7-Priority free agent
Adequate-sized, talented, inconsistent cornerback with moldable tools and scheme versatility, though he requires polish and patience.
-------------------------
Andre_Hal 2543874 216
The Baton Rouge-area prep was a four-year starter at defensive back. Also lettered in basketball and track and was a member of a state champion 4x200-meter relay team.

In 2013, he tallied 49 tackles, 15 pass breakups and three INTs with 6.5 tackles for loss in 12 games (11 starts). His overall 18 passes defended led the SEC. Missed one game with an injury. Team captain.
Lacks ideal length -- has short arms and small hands. Disadvantaged vs. bigger, physical receivers. Limited functional strength to pry himself off blocks. Could stand to refine his technique. Tends to clutch and grab when he's beat, which happens too frequently. Gets out of phase and does not demonstrate a feel for routes. Average leaping ability.
Has man-cover skills. Good balance and flexibility to mirror receivers off the line. Enough speed to run with receivers. Good zone awareness, read-and-react and plant-and-drive. Confident and competitive. Has kickoff-return experience. Solid intangibles.
Rounds 6-7
Adequate-sized, pesky corner lacking desirable length and physicality to survive outside. Has competitive makeup for the position to vie for a Number 4 or Number 5 corner spot.
-------------------------
Will_Clarke 2543881 88
Played defensive line and tight end as a Pennsylvania prep. Redshirted in 2009. Saw his first West Virginia action in 2010, playing in four early games and collecting two tackles, one-half tackle for loss and zero sacks. Suffered a high ankle sprain against Marshall and missed the remainder of the year.

Started all 12 games for the Mountaineers at defensive tackle in 2013 and recorded 49 tackles, 17 tackles for loss and six sacks with three passes batted and one forced fumble.
Does not play to his size -- plays too tall and does not generate power through his core. Shrivels against double teams and is too easily uprooted. Needs to play with better pop and power in his hands. Linear, vanilla rusher -- does not have a variety of moves to defeat and accelerate off blocks.
Has a long, athletic, muscular frame. Very good movement skills for his size. Flashes the ability to penetrate or stack and shed. Gives effort in pursuit and ranges to make tackles. Solid personal and football character -- has leadership traits. Smart and coachable. Durable three-year starter.
Rounds 5-6
Looks the part with desirable length and musculature to warrant consideration as a developmental five-technique in a one-gapping 3-4 scheme or base end in a 4-3 front, though he will have to make significant strides with his technique and improve his run defense to be more than just a guy.
-------------------------
Andrew_Jackson 2543882 203
Prepped in Florida. Did not play football as a sophomore in high school after he was arrested on an attempted burglary charge and completed nine months of community service. His high school coach contended --NAME-- was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time and took the blame for friends. Dressed for just one game in 2010. Started all 12 games at middle linebacker in 2011, producing 109 tackles, 17 tackles for loss and 3.5 sacks with a pass breakup and a forced fumble. Was the Hilltoppers' leading tackler for the second straight season in 2012, when he started 12 of 13 games played at MLB and posted 122 tackles, 17.5 tackles for loss and two sacks with a pass breakup and four forced fumbles. Did not start against Louisiana Lafayette. Started 10 of 11 games played at middle linebacker in 2013 and totaled 95 tackles, 8.5 tackles for loss and one sack with two pass breakups. Did not start against South Alabama, then was suspended against Georgia State (violation of team rules). Was medically excluded at the combine.
Lacks ideal length. Thick, tight hips and heavy legs. Average eyes and instincts. Needs to improve hand use and shed ability. Lacks speed to track down ball carriers on the perimeter. Leaves some production on the field -- inconsistent tackler. Man-coverage limitations. Does not project as a core special-teams player. Is immature and needs to learn what it means to be professional. Weight tends to fluctuate.
Thickly built, especially through his trunk and lower body. Has ideal bulk to fit inside a 3-4. Physically strong tackler when he's able to square up and wrap. Intense, confident and competitive. Did not look out of place when WKU stepped up in competition. Productive three-year starter. Very good lateral agility displayed in 4.24-second 20-yard shuttle time at his pro day.
Rounds 5-6
A stout, physical, downhill thumper with eventual-starter potential inside a 3-4 front where he's protected and able to attack the ball. However, suspect character and work ethic make him a risky investment, and he'd be best served in a locker room with a strong veteran presence.
-------------------------
Beau_Allen 2543884 224
Played in all 54 games in his college career. 2013: Honorable mention All-Big Ten. Played in 13 games and made 12 starts. 2012: Started all 14 games. Recorded a blocked punt against Purdue. 2011: Played all 14 games. 2010: Played all 13 games. High school: Was a finalist for Minnesota Mr. Football.
Marginal value as a pass rusher. Ordinary bull rush. Needs to play with better pad level -- plays too tall and is too easily engaged. Unrefined hand use and slow to disengage. Does not dominate single blocking. Is straightlinish and struggles to change direction. Slow of foot with limited range. Not an impactful playmaker.
Stoutly built lower body (squats a small house). Good initial thrust off the snap.  Sheer size, natural girth and functional strength to occupy blocks. Has a desirable mentality for the position. Brings energy, plays hard and gives terrific pursuit effort for a big man. Tough and durable. Very good 10-yard splits (1.68 seconds) at his pro day, indicating surprising short-area burst for a 330-pounder.
Round 7-Priority free agent
Big, beefy, active, loquacious nose tackle who does not consistently play to his size or weight-room strength, but has developmental value as a 3-4, two-down run stuffer.
-------------------------
Marquis_Flowers 2549896 212
Has a lean build and could use additional bulk. Lacks physicality and plays small. Does not play to his timed speed. Average instincts. Lacks a plan as a blitzer/edge rusher and gets overwhelmed and engulfed by bigger bodies. Struggles with adjustments, and overall work ethic has considerable room for improvement. Did not play on special teams. Can be too chirpy when concentration is needed.
Excellent timed speed and explosiveness -- clocked a 4.51-second 40 and 37 1/2-inch vertical jump at his pro day. Is tough and will battle through injuries, finishing 2012 season with a shoulder injury and 2013 with a spatted right ankle that noticeably affecting his movement. Solid tackle production -- has great range, is around the ball a lot and can track down speed backs. Good recovery speed (when out of position).
Priority free agent
An overgrown box safety, --NAME-- converted to "Sam" linebacker as a junior and possesses intriguing measurables to warrant interest as a developmental, fast-flowing linebacker prospect. Has clear make-it athletic traits but must learn what it means to be a pro to earn a roster spot.
-------------------------
Randell_Johnson 2549915 221
Not a nuanced pass rusher. Does not show a plan or variety of rush moves. Lacks ideal functional-playing strength and take-on ability. Average instincts and anticipation. Late to trigger. Durability has been an issue throughout his career with nagging injuries.
Outstanding size and arm length. Highly athletic with explosive power in his body. Flashes pass-rush ability with good closing speed. Long-reach, wrap-tackler. Very solid pro day showing, registering a 38 1/2-inch vertical jump and clocking a 40 time as low as 4.60 seconds (with a 10-15 mile-per-hour wind at his back) and showed fluidity dropping into coverage.
Round 7-Priority free agent
Long-limbed, rangy strong-side linebacker with intriguing dimensions to be deployed as a 3-4 rush outside linebacker. Developmental project with some upside to be groomed.
-------------------------
Brandon_Watts 2549919 223
Light-framed and does not play with power in his body. Very limited strength to fend off blockers -- is easily sealed and walled off. Average eyes and reactive quickness vs. the run and pass. Allows separation vs. quick-cutting receivers. Has room for improvement as an open-field tackler.
Rare timed speed. Very quick to the perimeter and covers a lot of ground. Easily keeps stride with tight ends in the slot and offers solid man-coverage ability on backs. Can carry receivers vertically and buzz the flats. Lines up on the edge and offers some pass-rush potential. Is fluid and loose-hipped dropping into coverage. Posted 6.89-second three-cone drill at pro day workout. Has gunner experience.
Rounds 5-6
A finesse, run-and-hit, coverage linebacker with the athletic traits and raw speed worth developing on the weak side, where he can be covered up in a fast-flowing, one-gap defense such as Dallas, Seattle or Tampa Bay. Could factor on special-teams coverage readily.
-------------------------
Shelby_Harris 2549926 235
Lacks ideal height. Average quickness off the snap. Can play with more consistent leverage and technique -- exposes his frame and needs to develop pass-rush moves and counters.
