                    "Bottom Line": "This Australia native came through the junior college ranks before starting all 13 games for the 2011 BCS champions at five-technique and another 13 games at nose tackle in 2012. Williams uses his size, consistent motor and supreme toughness to drain his opponents at the point of attack. His best NFL position is likely at nose tackle, but Williams has enough athleticism to play multiple spots for a 3-4 team at the next level.",

                    "Strengths": "Brute nose tackle (though he plays some five-technique) with a very good motor. Solid two-gap player who keeps his eyes in the backfield to find the ball. Plays with leverage, gets under the pads of his man to hold the line or push him into the backfield. Has enough quickness and power off the snap to pop off his blocker and grab backs heading outside or coming through the middle. Uses quick hands to swipe aside lunging blockers to penetrate into the backfield. Stays upright against cut blocks and gives second effort to get up when on the ground. Gets low with power in short-yardage situations. Also hustles to the sideline to chase scrambling quarterbacks and stretch plays when fresh. Pushes the pocket a bit as a pass rusher, and will work past lesser blockers' shoulders into the backfield. Cleans up piles, sending linebackers flying.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Not an exceptional athlete, relies on hustle and strength to make plays. Lacks the quickness and agility to be a regular factor in pass rush or corral quicker ballcarriers in space. Thick in the middle and a bit thinner in the legs; plays top-heavy, ends up on the ground too often. Gets caught up on blocks at times inside, lacking hand and foot quickness to disengage to make the play.",

That isn't a big surprise to anyone seeing the vast amount of ink all over Williams' body, which could be seen as an indication of the dedication and toughness he shows on the field on an every-down basis -' giving him a chance at a long NFL career.\nHe originally signed with Hawaii after playing for two club teams in Australia during his high school days (while also playing basketball and rugby). But he instead played for two seasons at Arizona Western Junior College, accumulating 13 tackles for loss and six sacks. He enrolled at Alabama in January 2011 so he could participate in spring practices -' a move that allowed him to start all 13 games as a five-technique defensive end. He was credited with 24 tackles, four for loss, on the season. With the departure of Josh Chapman to the NFL, Williams moved inside to handle nose tackle duties and started 13-of-14 games after sitting out the Western Kentucky game with concussion like symptoms. The Aussie showed more upfield ability than his predecessor, making 37 total tackles, 2.5 of which went for a loss including two half sacks. Williams added a blocked kick and continued to line up as a lead blocker in the Crimson Tide's goal line package."

He earned Freshman All-SEC honors for his 28 tackles, 4.5 for loss, on the year. Johnson earned six starts in both his sophomore and junior seasons, playing in every game and totaling 80 tackles, 10 for loss. As a senior, Johnson played in all 13 games, with 5 starts.

Practiced fitting on linebackers on combo blocks. Brings attitude on every play, constantly keeps his hands and feet moving when drive-blocking, rolling his hips through contact, and looking to pancake his man whenever possible. Doesn't have the quickest feet, but is very technically sound and uses his strong punch to stop defenders and his length to mirror. Drives interior defensive tackle off the ball on base blocks. Has handled a number of dominating college defensive lineman with ease.",

He was injected into the starting lineup the following year, starting all 13 games at left guard -- the same spot where he again lined up every week in the team's second BCS Championship season last fall. The second-team All-SEC pick in 2011 brought a nice combination of strength and mobility to Alabama's offensive line, which by itself would make him a potential starter at the next level."

Solid pass protector whether playing inside or outside, plays with a wide base, mirrors and anchors effectively by keeping his feet moving and extends his arms to stay engaged. Good hip extension in the run game. Gets correct angle to create running lane when blocking on the move, can also create space inside by moving his man out of the hole using his hands and bulk. Able to seal the tackle and then work to linebackers close to the line on combo blocks. Can reach the 3-technique defensive tackle from the center spot. Fits on second-level blocks very well in the run game. Very good football and general intelligence. Great awareness of late blitzers and twist stunts, and he gives excellent effort to reach free rushers so his quarterback stays upright.",

Top-heavy, upright runner on pulls without great foot speed. Gets to the second level well, but can struggle tracking and adjusting to moving targets. Quicker linebackers and defensive backs jump around his lunges if he is unable to get his hands on their numbers. Inconsistent firing out of his stance and staying low on short-yardage plays. Hand placement improved in his senior season, but he has soft hands with a limp punch. Doesn't play with a mean streak. Can get complacent and will fight for initial position, but doesn't finish blocks and allows his man to disengage too often. Prone to making his initial block and then ball-watching instead of finding a second target. Has a lengthy injury history (but shows the toughness to play through them) and will need to check out medically.",

Alabama head coach Nick Saban has compared the four year starter to NFL great Bruce Matthews, who famously played all five offensive line positions in the NFL. Jones, too, played all five offensive line positions during his four years starting at Alabama. The medical redshirt was made necessary by an injury to his right shoulder three games into his first year on campus. He then started all 14 contests at right guard as a redshirt freshman for Nick Saban's first BCS champion Tide squad in 2009. For his redshirt sophomore season, Jones earned third-team All-American honors from the Associated Press, as well as first-team All-SEC mention from league media for his play as a sophomore. He started 11 games that year, missing the final two regular season contests with a high ankle sprain.

He started 11 games that year, missing the final two regular season contests with a high ankle sprain.\nJones made the rare switch from right guard to left tackle in 2011 to replace James Carpenter, a first-round pick of the Seattle Seahawks. He handled the transition so well (while also playing left guard, right tackle and center at times) for the Bowl Championship Series champions that he received the Outland Trophy as the nation's best 'interior lineman' as well as the SEC's Jacob Blocking Trophy, given to the league's best lineman. He also possesses the intelligence and high character NFL offensive line coaches desire in their prospects, finishing his degree in accounting in just three years, and won the Wuerffel Trophy for his play on the field and work in the academic and community service worlds.\nHis final year on campus featured another move, this time to the center position. He capped the year off with another consensus selection to the All-American and All-SEC teams, as well as winning the Rimington Trophy (awarded to the nation's top center), despite a Lisfranc injury limiting his mobility over the second half of the season."

Wilson spent much of the year under duress, but showed impressive toughness in consistently staring down the barrel to deliver throws while getting hit, and bouncing up right after.\nWhile scouts will want to see more from Wilson in the vertical passing game, it's tough to ignore his overall skill set. In addition to these quarterbacking skills, Wilson's a proven leader and it has been reported that he comes off as quite charming in interviews with teams.

Shows ability to hit stationery targets and the anticipation to lead receivers in stride and wait patiently for them to get open. Looks at multiple targets before checking down to underneath option. Quicker feet than anticipated, can get first downs on the run when defenses are in man or in deep zones. Can sling the ball into the flat from awkward release points.",

While he has impressive intermediate arm strength, Wilson frequently floats or underthrows balls on deeper patterns due to a tendency to drop his elbow. Not a quick-twitch athlete; footwork coming out from under center is uneven, pro pass rushers will get him on first contact and disciplined linebackers will prevent his longer runs.

Hamilton's numbers dropped off a bit in his junior season (34-542, 4 TD) as the team spread the wealth among a slew of receivers. Hamilton's speed and strength breaking tackles led his breakout year as a senior, recording 90 catches for 1335 yards (14.8 YPC) and five touchdowns as one of the few targets that quarterback Tyler Wilson trusted. His production earned him first-team All-Conference honors as well as third-team All-American honors. Hamilton also ran track for the Razorbacks for the 2010 season, running a personal-best time of 21.09 in the 200-meter dash at the Arkansas Last Chance Meet."

Griffin and running back Terrance Ganaway). Scouts already saw enough of his talents last season to make sure they returned to Waco, no matter how the team fared this season.\nHe earned honorable mention notice from Big 12 coaches as a junior by gaining nearly 1,000 yards (957) and scoring 11 times in his 59 receptions. It wasn't Williams' first year as a starter, however, as he lined up with the first team 10 times in 2010. In addition to his receiving numbers that year (43-484, 4 TD), Williams was also the team's leading kickoff returner (21.4-yard average). It was the second straight year he led the team in that category, as he took over the reins for the final two months of his redshirt freshman season (768 yards, 24.1-yard average).\nEven with the loss of Griffin and Wright, Williams flourished his senior year. Williams led the country in receiving yards (97-1,832-12, 18.9-yard average), earning first-team All-American honors and helping Baylor finish with a respectable 8-5 record."

He was only a third-team All-MAC pick in 2011 as the full-time starter on the blind side, partially because he missed the final two games of the year with a knee injury. But in 2012 Fisher received first-team All-MAC honors after starting all 12 games at left tackle. NFL scouts will have no choice but to give him grades similar to those they gave Staley when he came out of Mount Pleasant.\nHe fell through the recruiting cracks a bit as a 250-pound tackle coming out of Stoney Creek High School in Michigan, where he only played on the offensive line there in this senior season (he captained both the football and basketball teams that year). But he still proved himself strong enough as a true freshman to play in eight games, with two starts at left tackle. In 2010, he didn't start the first three games but proved an invaluable member of the line in the last nine, starting four games at right tackle, moving over to right guard for two weeks, and then lining up at left tackle for the final three contests. During his senior year, Fisher anchored an offensive line that averaged 6.2 yards-per-play, second best in the MAC and the same unit only allowed 14 sacks, which was good for fourth best in the MAC."

Shows the ability to create behind the line of scrimmage when the play side breaks down, and the creativity and knowledge of pursuit angles to set up second level defenders. Shows patience running behind pulling guards and fullbacks, can cut in either direction off the block. Stiff-arm in the open field can be effective in keeping away defensive backs.

It was the sixth time in the past eight drafts a 'small school' receiver heard his name called in the first 100 picks, including notables Vincent Jackson (drafted by San Diego in 2005 out of Northern Colorado), Laurent Robinson (Atlanta, 2007, Southern Illinois), and Jerome Simpson (Cincinnati, 2008, Coastal Carolina).\nThere is a chance Mellette claims that title in 2013, although specific performances during his senior year could make evaluators hesitate, namely against UNC in the opener. In 2012, he started all 11 games and caught 97 passes for 1,398 yards and 18 touchdowns. Mellette led the Football Championship Subdivision in receptions (113) and receiving yards (1,639) while scoring 12 times and earning first-team All-Southern Conference honors as a junior in 2011. Even Vanderbilt (11 catches, 180 yards, TD) and Quick's ASU squad (14-236, TD) weren't immune to Mallette's talent. The Phoenix will continue to throw the ball with impunity throughout 2012 (they've averaged 39 pass attempts a game over the last three years) behind senior quarterback Thomas Wilson, so look for Mallette's strong hands to see a lot of action again this fall. It was the second straight year he was Elon's top receiver, again scoring 12 times and finishing among the top six in the FCS in both receptions (86) and receiving yards per game (100.0, 1,100 total) in 2010. Those numbers were a bit of a surprise given his minimal production as a redshirt freshman (8-117, 2 TD), but the graduation of former All-American Terrell Hudgins (whose single-season receiving yard mark Mallette broke in 2011) was a major factor."

He plays smart, and that might be the most improtant trait when looking at safeties. However, despite it being unique, Cyprien doesn't have a very well known name ... yet.",

Holds his ground against blocks from bigger opponents, and also runs through traffic to wrap up ballcarriers inside (sometimes as a fast edge blitzer). Possesses enough speed and athleticism to cover ground as a zone defender in the back half and line up against slot receivers inside. Closes on stretch runs and quick throws to outside receivers even when playing well back from the line. Beats receiver blocks with quickness or strength. His secure tackling in those situations is also notable, as he brings some attitude into his attempts unlike other defensive backs in this class. Used as a blitzer on run and pass plays, can overpower running back blocks.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Doesn't have elite range or the height/length combination to play as a single-deep safety. Quick enough to make a hit after the catch when deep, but is often a step slow to recognize the pass coming into his area. Aggressive in coverage, he can be sucked up by play action and will jump underneath routes, allowing plays over the top. Lacks elite change of direction and quickness in man coverage, and does not recover like a corner if beaten by a quick move off the line or in space.",

There was no sophomore slump, as he led the Panthers with 113 tackles (three for loss) while intercepting another pass, recording six pass breakups, and creating three fumbles.  Before the 2011 season, Cyprien claimed the number seven jersey previously worn by 2011 Tampa Bay Buccaneers' seventh-round pick Anthony Gaitor (he switched from the 25 sweater). While his tackle total decreased in his junior season (81), his tackles for loss (5.5) and passes defended (one INT, eight PBU) rose on his way to a second straight second-team All-Sun Belt honor. His 11-tackle, two-pass-breakup effort against Louisville early in the year didn't escape the notice of scouts, even with teammate T.Y. Hilton lighting up the Cardinals as a receiver and returner for 268 all-purpose yards.\nIn 2012, Cyprien drew enough recognition with his play to earn a Senior Bowl invitation. On the way to becoming FIU's all-time leading tackle, Cyprien notched 93 total tackles his senior year, including 3.5 for loss.

There's certainly no issue with his motor, as he will hustle to the sideline if the play can be made.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Though Carradine shows most all of the physical attributes teams covet in a defensive end, his lack of experience is a negative.

Carradine has big-time talent, even though he finished the year on the sideline after seeing starter's action for a majority of the season.\nThe Cincinnati product signed with Illinois out of high school, but academic issues forced him to enroll at Butler Community College. His 26 sacks in two years for the Grizzlies, including a nation-leading 16 in a 2010 season where the team lost the national junior college championship game, made Carradine the top JUCO prospect in the country. Several major college programs recruited Carradine to finish out his career on their campus, but Florida State won that battle. He played in all 13 games for the Seminoles in 2011, and despite not starting a single game, he had more tackles than Werner (38 versus 37), and his eight tackles for loss included 5.5 sacks. He finished the year strong, compiling four tackles and a sack against Notre Dame in the team's 18-14 Champs Sports Bowl win. As a senior, Carradine was thrust into first string duties opposite Bjoern Werner after Brandon Jenkins was sidelined with a foot injury. He then went on to start 12 games, registering 80 total tackles, including 13 tackles for loss, 11 of which were sacks. Against Florida, however, Carradine tore his ACL and will miss a large portion of the pre-draft process because of it, including the Senior Bowl."

Does not have elite size or strength to get through better linemen once they are anchored ' which could also cause him issues standing up to NFL offensive linemen on a down-by-down basis as a starter. Poor pad level prevents him from being able to get under offensive lineman's pads. Does a good job re-directing with his spin move, but gets overly reliant on it once its successful.

                    "Weaknesses": "Thin and narrow built lower body, which contributes to waist bending and poor balance. Ends up on the ground more than you'd like. Susceptible to cut blocks and doesn't deal well with trash at his feet, though he gives good effort to recover and return to the play. Quickness is decent for his size, but he offers little as an interior pass rusher and will be a two down player in the NFL. Stops on contact with double teams at times instead of pushing through. Plays tall and is slow off the snap, will lose upper-body strength battles to get off-balance. Doesn't fight for inside hand position. As a result, gets rooted out too often by smaller offensive linemen who get underneath his pads and out-leverage him. Could be more consistent shedding to grab ball carriers coming through holes inside.",

The Bulldogs hoped he can be as big a difference-maker at nose tackle as another junior college transfer, Terrence Cody, was for Alabama in their 2009 BCS championship season. Jenkins' build is not as sloppy as that of \"Mount Cody,\" and his pure width and athleticism makes him an intriguing prospect.\nThe Connecticut native was slowed down a bit in the 2011 preseason with a hamstring injury, and also suffered from heat exhaustion in his first August practice. But he played in every game, starting seven of the last nine contests while accumulating 28 tackles, six for loss and three sacks while facing constant double teams. The school also credited him with 10 quarterback pressures, a large number for a large man. His role continued to grow for his senior season (50 tackles, two for loss, one sack) as he played a number of positions along Georgia's 3-4 defense."

Williams was named one of the team's top newcomers after his true freshman year, finishing strong by making three of his season total of five tackles against Texas A&M in the Bulldogs' Independence Bowl win. In 2010, he was one of the team's Most Improved Players on special teams but also started three contests (34 tackles on the year). When a spot in the starting lineup opened up his junior year, all he did was lead the team in tackles (72, five for loss), intercept four passes (including one in the Capital One Bowl loss to Michigan State), and break up six others.

Average recovery speed at cornerback, must prove himself in man coverage as he will fail to stay with receivers downfield.

He also handled kicking duties, connecting on over 100 extra points. Despite these accomplishments, and the fact his older brother Marcus was a safety at Michigan State, Hyde wasn't highly rated by recruiting services and was a fall-back option for most Big Ten programs. Iowa's scholarship offer earned his loyalty -' and his play has justified their investment.\nAfter making four tackles while playing in every game of his true freshman season, Hyde became a playmaker as a full-time starting cornerback in 2010. League media gave him honorable mention notice due to his 82 tackles, four interceptions, seven pass breakups. He also scored twice that season, returning a pitch 66 yards for a touchdown after safety Tyler Sash intercepted a Michigan State pass, and providing the winning points in the team's 27-24 Insight Bowl victory over Missouri by bringing back an interception 72 yards.  Hyde worked at safety during spring 2011 practices, and started the first two games there in the fall before moving back to cornerback for the final 11 games.

Mobile behind the line of scrimmage, and displays the straight-line speed to reach targets and fits onto blocks near the line and at the second level. Will hit multiple targets in the open field. Solid in his cut blocks, makes it hard for tackles to recover. Solid anchor on special teams units. Plays with a nasty streak; brings any fight back to his opponent, and then some. Also hustles downfield to help running backs get an extra yard and is willing to clean up piles.",

He decided to transfer closer to home after the season, picking Kansas State (just like fellow transfers from Wichita, Bryce and Arthur Brown), partially because he wanted to prove himself at quarterback. But during his 2009 redshirt season, he was again approached by coaches to make the position change '- so he did. He played in every game at receiver in 2010, starting seven and making 25 catches for 330 yards and four touchdowns.

He played through the pain, however, showing another attribute typically possessed by successful wrestlers -- toughness.\nKSU coaches liked what they saw in him as a true freshman, placing him in the starting lineup at right tackle. The rest of the league's coaches also appreciated his talents early on, voting him third-team all-conference in 2010 as a full-time starter (first eight games at left tackle, last four at right tackle). They pushed him up a notch after his junior year, naming him second-team All-MAC as he again started every game on the blind side. Winters kept that job in 2012 and started all 14 games at left tackle. He finally had something to block for, as Dri Archer broke out as one of the top playmakers in the country.

Good sideline awareness to get two feet in-bounds while making the catch. Used on quick throws to take advantage of his shiftiness and surprisingly tough running, lowers his shoulder and is not easy for smaller cornerbacks to drag down after the catch.

It was a bit of a surprise that he didn't contribute in that game, since he had come on late in the season to finish with 15 receptions for 362 yards and four scores. He continued to impress as a sophomore and junior, earning honorable mention All-Conference USA honors by leading the Herd in receiving each season (44-689, 5 TD in 2010; 49-668, 12 TD in 2011). His two touchdowns were the difference in the team's 21-10 win over Florida International in the 2011 Beef O'Brady's Bowl, but most college football observers thought his amazing back-handed catch against East Carolina was one of the plays of the year. In his senior year, Dobson was named to the All-Conference USA second-team. In 10 games, Dobson caught 57 passes for 679 yards and 3 touchdowns."

He does not quite possess the two-time Super Bowl champ's elite arm and bulk, but still has enough of both ' along with the athleticism and deft passing touch to make NFL-caliber plays on the run ' to become one of the top passers in the class. His career flew somewhat under the radar in the MAC conference, but has the size, arm, accuracy, athleticism, and production that NFL teams covet.",

                    "Strengths": "Looks like an NFL quarterback, and has more room to add muscle to his frame. Keeps a solid base, active feet, and has a reliable over-the-top delivery for his accurate passes to all levels of the field. Good athlete for his size, able to sidestep and run away from blitzers in the backfield while usually keeping his eyes downfield to see if a receiver breaks open. Picks up first downs, or simply gets something out of nothing, with his feet. Shows the strength, in terms of body and arm, to get passes off with defenders hanging off his body in the pocket. Will get out of bounds instead of taking a hit on the run. Has experience both under center and in shotgun, but played in more of a shotgun spread scheme during his senior year. Flashes anticipation on crossing routes to hit his man on the run. Throws accurately on the move to his left or right, and will stop to set his feet if there's time on moving pockets. His arm is strong enough to fling the ball 40 yards downfield on the run, and also to throw in tight windows over the middle. Flashes great placement on fades and sideline throws, puts ball on his man's shoulder where only he can catch it. Good strength to pull down the ball at the last minute as well as step through tackle attempts in the pocket. Communicates with receivers pre-snap if he sees something worth exploiting in the defense. Big body and quick feet are helpful on quarterback sneaks. Mechanically sound overall. Has held for placement kicks.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Pocket poise needs to improve; takes off from the pocket if his primary read is covered or he sees pressure, but is also inconsistent feeling backside rushers. Needs to prove he can find check-downs and secondary options from the pocket. Will stare down his target, allowing defenders to follow his eyes to the ball. Accuracy in the intermediate portion of the field can be streaky. Straight-line speed and elusiveness aren't elite, quicker NFL defenders will track him down in the pocket and will make him pay for running too often. May have picked up bad habits playing for an undermanned team. Can be prone to over-improvisation and trusts his arm too much at times, throwing balls up for grabs or across his body into traffic over the middle.",

                    "plain_text": "It's easy to finger Dysert  (pronounced DYE-sert) as another MAC quarterback piquing the interest of NFL general managers, especially when he's leading the same Miami team for which Ben Roethlisberger played before winning two Super Bowls with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Over his four years starting, Dysert ended up breaking Roethlisberger's school career passing attempts, completions, and yardage records. So it's natural for teams to watch him closely in the hopes his skill set will translate similarly to Roethlisberger's (even if he doesn't quite possess Roethlisberger's arm strength or bulk) at the next level.\nDysert pulled down 2007 Ohio state high school player of the year honors (an award also won by Roethlisberger when he was an Ohio prep) despite relinquishing his quarterback duties for three-plus games due to a broken thumb; maybe the fact he moved to wide receiver and played linebacker during those games swayed the voters to give him the title. Dysert won the team's scout player of the year award during his redshirt season of 2008 before playing in 11 games, with nine starts, the following season (2,611 yards, 61.6% completion rate, 12 touchdowns, 16 interceptions). He continued his progression as a passer as a sophomore (2,406, 64.7 percent, 13, 12), starting the first 10 games before suffering a lacerated kidney. The injury prevented Dysert from passing over the last four games, though he did return as the team's placeholder for their GoDaddy.com Bowl win over Middle Tennessee State. He stayed healthy throughout the 2011 season, starting every game, passing for 3,513 yards and greatly improving his completion percentage (65.8) and touchdown-to-interception ratio (23-11). The Redhawks struggled during his senior season, going through a scheme change and posting a 4-8 record, but Dysert's production remained steady (3,483, 62.9 percent, 25 touchdowns, 12 interceptions), earning him third-team All-MAC honors."

He's at his best with the ball in his hands, though, and most of his time at Michigan has been spent in a quasi-running back role.

Track speed makes it very difficult for defenders to get the angle on him once he's in the open field. Sidesteps breaking down or penetrating linebackers in the hole with quick feet, heads outside. Also flows through creases up the middle; deadly when defenses are spread in the red zone. Thick lower body with strong legs. Spins out of tackles in space, has balance to continue on for big gains. Very patient runner who reads blocks like a veteran, following linemen on zone and stretch plays. Not contacts-shy, will try to get the extra yard as a ball-carriers, often falling forward as he's being wrapped up. As a passer, he can stretch the field with a strong arm, displays some touch on fades and over the top of defenses, and find open receivers on the run. Accurate in the short-to-medium passing game, especially to stationary targets. Usually operates from the shotgun, but does come out from under center. Has confidence in his arm to throw into traffic. Escapes the pocket in a hurry, but keeps his eyes up to flip the ball to a receiver when trapped by rushing defenders. Generally makes the right decision in the zone-read option, though he will make an occasional risky pitch or hand off when he should have kept the ball.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Does not have a proven pro position. Must prove he can catch NFL throws/punts/kickoffs, take a beating from pro defenders as a ballcarrier, and learn how to pass protect. Does not power through tackles due to upright running style. Ball security is an issue because of his slight build and willingness to spin out of tackles; eight fumbles in 2011. Lacks the size teams usually look for in their quarterbacks, and the accuracy in the more difficult timing patterns that pro passers must complete. Throws passes up for grabs, ending with mixed results based on the talent of the defense. NFL defenders are more likely to prevent him from seeing the field and wrap him up in the backfield when he hesitates to pull the trigger. Nagging injuries over the course of his career, and he's had an extensive rushing workload, even for a quarterback.",

The better question is what position will suit him best in the NFL? The conversion of Antwaan Randle El (whose Big Ten quarterback rushing record Robinson broke) might be a better template for scouts to follow because his smooth running, vision and quickness could be used in the return game, at slot receiver, or in a hybrid running back/receiver position that Dexter McCluster held for Kansas City in 2011. But no matter if Robinson will be throwing or catching at the next level, at least a couple of general managers will value his athleticism enough to select him somewhere in the first two days of the draft.\nRobinson, whose nickname is 'Shoelace' because he plays with his shoes untied, was a four-star prospect from Florida as a dual-threat quarterback (4,784 yards passing, 1,132 rushing in his career) and track star (finished third in the Class 4A 100-meter dash at the 2008 Florida state meet). He played in all 12 games at quarterback as a true freshman (14-for-31, 188 yards, two TD, four INT) in concert with starter Tate Forcier, with one start at running back (69 rushes, 351 yards, five TD). Forcier attempted a pass to Robinson in 2009, but it fell incomplete.\nRobinson took over the starting role from Forcier (who eventually transferred) in 2010, and won the Big Ten Player of the Year and Football Writers' Association of America All-American notice (as a running back) for his play. He became the first player in NCAA history to throw for more than 2,500 yards (2,570) and rush for 1,500 yards (1,702) in a single season, ranked second in the country in all-purpose yards, second in rushing yards, and 20th in the nation in pass efficiency (62.5 percent completion rate, 18 TD, 11 INT) while leading the Wolverines to the Gator Bowl. Statistically, Robinson's second year as a starter in 2011 wasn't quite as successful (1,176 rushing yards, 2,173 passing), but he was named honorable mention all-conference by league coaches and was responsible for more touchdowns (20 passing, 16 rushing against 18 and 14 in 2010) and helped the team to an 11-2 record, which included an upset of Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl.\nFor his senior season, nagging injuries to Robinson allowed Devin Gardner to step into the quarterback role. As a result, the Michigan staff began using Denard in more creative ways, prepping him for his future as a multi-purpose threat in the NFL. He finished the year with 177 rushing attempts for 1266 yards (a career high 7.2 yards per carry), ending the season with a strong performance as the team's lead running back in their bowl game against South Carolina (23-100-1 TD)"

He has experience playing a number of spots in the secondary, beginning his career as a safety, before eventually settling on the boundary corner and nickel spots.

Former safety is not shy of making contact, solid tackler when coming downhill. Quick to attack running plays, even when playing off-coverage, making it tough for receivers to get a hand on him. Effective as a blitzer against the run and pass. Rips at the ball whether making a tackle downfield or attacking the quarterback in the backfield. Excellent mirror and change of direction skills. Not asked to play a lot of press coverage and he's not very strong, but he has a quick disruptive jam.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Getting bigger, but still quite thin, especially in his lower half. Stronger backs can still carry him when they have a head of steam and physical receivers can block him on the edge and separate from him easily downfield. Plays a bit tall, will miss tackles coming in high and lacks strength to arm tackle receivers. Does not have great straight-line speed, will not recover once losing a step. Rarely backpedals, asked to play mostly off-coverages and opens his hips early to prevent getting beat deep.

But his play at cornerback the past two seasons is what has put him on NFL scouts' radar as a potential starter at the next level.\nLeague coaches named him Freshman All-SEC squad for his play in his first season in Starkville (four interceptions, two touchdowns). He made the switch to cornerback before the 2010 season, starting 12 games, intercepting three passes and breaking up seven others as a sophomore. One of his picks that year helped the team beat the Gators 10-7 on their home field. His game took a step forward in 2011; not only did he make an impact in coverage (five interceptions, nine pass break-ups), but also as a regular blitzer (eight tackles for loss, three sacks, three forced fumbles) in the Bulldogs' aggressive defense. He decided to return for his senior season after receiving a fourth round grade from the NFL advisory committee. Banks' play was somewhat uneven over the course of his senior season, but he still played well enough (63 tackles, two tackles for loss, 11 passes defended, 4 interception) to earn first team All-Conference, second-team All-America honors, and the Jim Thorpe Award, given to the nation's top defensive back."

Gets under their shoulder to get leverage and contain. Solid wrap-up tackler in the open field, with good length for his size and an aggressive attitude to bring the ball carrier to the ground. Also strong enough to lower his pads and stop the forward momentum of piles. Utilizes his speed to hustle downfield regularly. He'll contribute heavily on special teams coverage units.",

Linebacker Lavonte David parlayed his two exceptional seasons with the Cornhuskers (after a couple of great years at Fort Scott Community College) into a second-round selection in the 2012 draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nHe was one of the top defensive backs in the junior college ranks in 2009 and 2010, intercepting nine passes for Chaffey College while also being a threat as a kick returner. In high school, Stafford actually played with current Huskers quarterback Taylor Martinez at Norco High School in California (where Stanford/Minnesota Vikings running back Toby Gerhart played) for two seasons before Martinez transferred. Academics kept him from jumping on offers from several major programs who coveted his services out of Norco. Big Ten media voted Stafford honorable mention all-conference for his work in 2011 (12 starts in 13 games played, 80 tackles, three for loss, team-high 10 pass breakups). In 2012, Stafford was named first-team All-Big Ten by the media, and second-team All-Big Ten by the coaches. He recorded 96 tackles, seven pass breakups, and four interceptions."

Fills a gap in the run games even if starting the play in a cover-two alignment due to his recognition and reaction abilities. His athleticism helps him break down in the open field and his length aids him drag them to the ground, making him a reliable open-field tackler. Another important component of Williams' game is that he shows great balance in coverage, showcasing a smooth back-pedal, and fluid hips. Shows the hands to make difficult interception, as well.",

Uses his hustle to chase ball carriers (20.5 tackles for loss, 8.5 sacks in two years starting) and strong anchor to hold the line. He has good quickness in relation to his size, but is overly reliant on this athleticism at the moment. Plays both three-technique and one-technique for North Carolina, and it's likely he's been coached/asked to be more of a penetrator than he will be in the NFL. For a player with his size and strength, you'd like to see him use it more. When he decides to get his pads low and anchor against base blocks and double teams, he can be impossible to move. Opposing teams made it a concern to try and run him upfield, or use his active motor in backside pursuit against him (running away from him to get him to chase and wear out).",

Good flexibility and balance, showing the ability to bend and roll his hips through contact off the ball and keep a wide base to anchor against base blocks and doubles. Violent tackler, will throw ballcarriers to the ground. Has enough short-area quickness to charge through the A-gap off the snap. Spins off blocks when moving forward to threaten hesitating quarterbacks or get a hand on running backs in the backfield. Can two-gap, moves to either side of his man to corral backs coming between the tackles. Shows good leverage, pad level, and hand quickness to split double teams. When fresh, he will chase a bit more than most players his size against the run as well as give a second effort if his initial pass rush move fails.",

Does not bull linemen backward very often, won't outquick NFL guards. Flashes quickness off the snap, but gets stuck on blocks too often when tired, and loses ability to get to the ball even if able to disengage. Can get low and create a pile on the goal line, but gets pushed back when playing high in other short-yardage situations. Doesn't have the athleticism to stop his momentum.

Flashes some attitude when challenged, maintaining contact and chasing his man out of the play. Quick recovery speed to get up after a cut block. Good pad level and surge coming out of his stance. Gets vertical movement on his man on base and double blocks. Constantly works his feet and swings his hips to get position on reach blocks.

Cooper also wrestled, which scouts always like to see because that sport teaches players how to use their hands effectively in one-on-one situations.  This skill set made him a starter at left guard for 10 games (he missed three starts with an ankle injury) as a redshirt freshman, earning a place on the All-ACC Freshman team.  Cooper has stayed healthy in each of the past two seasons, starting all 26 games (the 2010 opener at center and the following 25 at left guard) and earning second-team All-ACC honors as both a sophomore and junior.

Slaughter played in 11 games, started five, and was credited with 31 tackles, three pass break-ups, and an interception; he played through an ankle injury suffered in the opener for most of the year, missing two games and undergoing surgery after the season. As a junior, he often played around the line (45 tackles, four for loss, two sacks) but still had an impact in coverage duties while starting 10 of 13 games played. In his senior year, Slaughter participated in just three games before tearing his Achilles tendon. He was denied an extra year of eligibility by the NCAA. In those three games, he registered eight tackles and one pass breakup."

Johnson's feet keep moving through initial contact, allowing him to get into the correct blocking angle while engaged. He also uses his hands and length well to maintain distance with the defender. NFL coaches will like that he plays with an attitude, looks willing to hand-fight with defensive ends, usually lands multiple strong punches, and will consistently finish blocks with a strong-arm extension.",

After redshirting his first year with the Sooners as a tight end in 2009, Johnson failed to make any statistics in seven games played at tight end and defensive end the following year. In the spring of 2011, he begrudgingly moved from end to the offensive line due to injuries on that side of the ball. He didn't start the season opener against Tulsa, but lined up at right tackle for every game the rest of the year. Johnson continued that streak in 2012, this time at left tackle in place of the departed Donald Stephenson.

That job was made a bit harder with the offseason suspensions of three receivers, but even more important for his draft stock is his ability to consistently perform under pressure.\nJones expected to watch Bradford run the Sooners' offense in 2009, but Bradford's separated throwing shoulder put the young redshirt freshman in the spotlight more quickly than anticipated. He was voted the Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year while starting 10 of 13 games played, including a 418-yard, three-touchdown performance in a 31-27 Sun Bowl win over Stanford. The one-time Gatorade New Mexico High School Player of the Year didn't have to battle Bradford for the starting job as a sophomore, as the Rams selected him No. 1 overall in the 2010 draft. Jones took advantage of the situation, winning the Sammy Baugh Award as the nation's top college passer by completing 65.6 percent of his passes for 4,718 yards and 38 touchdowns (against just 12 interceptions). Once again he played well in the postseason, garnering Fiesta Bowl Offensive Player of the Game honors with 429 yards and three passing touchdowns in the 48-20 blowout of Connecticut. Despite those late-season troubles with Ryan Broyles out of the lineup, Jones still threw for 4,483 yards and 29 scores (his touchdown production dropped partially due to the implementation of the red-zone package run by Blake Bell), and was a finalist for the Manning Award while becoming the school's all-time passing leader. Jones' 2012 season saw him put up more gaudy statistics, although he might not have progressed into the overall quarterback many expected. He completed 66.1 percent of his passes for 4,267 yards in addition to a 30-11 TD-INT ratio. Jones' career ended with a 41-17 loss to Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl, in which he was 35-48 for 278 yards, one touchdown and one interception."

But after early success on the gridiron and playing sparingly for a local Corvallis team for college-eligible players and the Beavers' ball club, he set his focus squarely on his football career.\nHe played in all 13 games on special teams in his freshman year, making 11 tackles, 10 on special teams. Poyer again participated in every contest in 2010, making more of an impact on defense after changing from safety to cornerback (34 tackles, two interceptions-one for a 65-yard score in the 36-7 home win over USC) and averaging 27.8 yards per kick return. He finally got a chance to start in 2011 and intercepted four passes and broke up 12 others, earning second-team All-Pac 12 honors.

Whether taking off from the slot or outside, his feet are literally a step ahead of his defender on everything from speed outs, crossers, to jerk routes.  Displays the flexibility to grab throws behind him or over his shoulder when running deep. He'll also extend away from his body to bring in high or wide throws, and will stutter on the sideline to ensure he makes the catch in-bounds. Possesses some thickness to his frame, and is willing to lower his shoulder to get the extra yard ' often diving under defenders to get as many as possible. Wheaton also dabbled in track while at OSU, reminding scouts of his elite speed.",
                    "Weaknesses": "While he can elude defenders in the open field, he's not necessarily elite making men miss after the catch. Too often he will let the ball into his frame as opposed to attacking it. Will round off deeper pattern that consist of him coming back to the quarterback. Can be overwhelmed by physical corners in his route, and especially at the line of scrimmage. Inconsistent as a blocker. Willing, but too often will fall off his block, or allow his man to simply overpower him.",

Wheaton led the Beavers in receiving in 2010, starting eight of 12 games played with James Rodgers on the sideline (55-675, four TD) and was again used regularly on sweeps (27-220, two TD), finishing the year with a 10-catch, 137-yard effort against rival Oregon (where his cousin, Kenny, played in the mid-1990s) in the Civil War. He earned honorable mention All-Pac 12 honors while starting all 12 games as a junior, again leading the team in receiving (73-986, TD) and contributing as a runner (25-190).\nIn 2012, Wheaton eclipsed the 1,000-yard barrier, catching 91 passes for 1,244 yards and 11 touchdowns."

Contains well on his side of the field, has the closing speed to track down runners before they reach the sideline.

Competitive in 50-50 situations, active hands make it tough on receivers to complete the catch.

Takes time to rip off blocks with long arms and slower hands, can be moved out of the hole by better linemen. Lacks flexibility to keep his balance while turning the corner.

He did not see much action his first two years on campus, redshirting in 2008 and playing in just three games as a reserve the following year. Holmes stepped into the right guard spot as a sophomore, earning honorable mention all-conference honors.

Looks off and pump-fake safeties and communicate with receivers pre-snap on the opposite side of the field from which he intends to throw. Three-time team captain also possesses intangibles NFL teams desire at the position, taking hits and bouncing back, displaying intelligence with his multiple academic all-conference accolades, and earning a spot on the 2011 Allstate AFCA Good Works team.",

Does have have physical tools to make throws when he's not set, but has progressed in his ability to find space and get the ball of with awkward release platforms. Ball comes out of his hand poorly at times, though it usually reaches its intended target. Confident enough in his pre-snap read that he'll stare down his initial target. Sails passes over his receivers' heads when feeling pressure or in the three-step game. No threat to pick up large chunks of yardage with his feet. Improved completion percentage in 2011 came partially due to quick east-west throws to his talented wideouts. While he had a lot of attempts, there are questions as to what degree structure of the offense featured him or masked his physical limitations.

Though he's not an elite pass rush talent and is still growing into his frame, he presents scouts with surprising agility for his size and the length to be an effective 3-4 'backer capable of doing a bit of everything, with untapped potential as a mid-round pick.",

Quick feet and long strides help him close on quarterbacks, move down the line to crash on runs, as well as give him the short-area agility to move in coverage with slot receivers for short periods despite his height and length. Short area quickness, and the ability to redirect in an instant. Power hands at times. Capable of shedding in either direction to contain or fill a gap. Knows to knock receivers at the line and crossers off their routes with his strong arm extension. Has the length to wrap up ballcarriers trying to avoid him in the backfield, as well as grab backs running away from him.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Lacks sand in his pants and upper-body strength to be an every-down defensive end against NFL tackles, and gets consistently pushed back by double teams. Inconsistent coming off the snap quickly, at times looking like he can beat tackles with a strong first step but being among the last moving on other plays. Motor runs cold, don't pursue plays well. Loses track off his position in zone coverage. Can be eluded in space by quicker ballcarriers or in the backfield by mobile quarterbacks. Must speed up his hands to win battles against pro linemen, slow to disengage.",

Even though he missed out on the 2010 BCS championship season because of that decision, his career with the Golden Eagles predicts a NFL future in the path of former lean Southern Miss linebackers Michael Boley and Gerald McRath.\nCollins was a high school quarterback who led his team to back-to-back state championship games in his sophomore (when his Franklin County (Miss.) squad got the win) and junior seasons. After arriving in Hattiesburg, coaches' conversion of Collins paid immediate dividends; playing as a reserve in all 13 games, he accumulated 48 tackles (three for loss, two sacks). During his sophomore year, he moved from safety to linebacker due to a mid-season injury. He started seven games, playing in every contest, garnering honorable mention All-Conference USA honors with 76 tackles (three for loss, 2.5 sacks), intercepting two passes and breaking up two others. He was again put on the honorable mention squad for his work starting all 14 games in 2011, in which he totaled 98 tackles (19.5 for loss), 6.5 sacks, and eight pass break-ups. As a senior, Collins tallied 92 tackles (20 for loss), 10 sacks, four forced fumbles, and five passes broken up. This excellent senior year earned him first-team All-Conference USA honors."

Michael started his sophomore season with three 100-yard games, but his production tailed off a bit, and then the season ended prematurely after breaking his right tibia (leg) against Texas Tech in the eighth game of the year. He finished with 631 rushing yards and four touchdowns. Michael worked himself back onto the field to start his junior year, and broke out with a 230-yard, three-touchdown outing in A&M's disappointing loss to Arkansas at Cowboys Stadium.

The former running back put up great numbers at the combine, including a 4.34 40-yard dash, but he does not consistently play at that speed.

Foot quickness and strong route knowledge allow him to separate on outs, crosses, and jerk routes from the slot. Slows down in passing windows and finds room in zones to maximize his quarterback's ability to find him. Often used on quick screens to take advantage of his ability to regularly sidestep would-be tacklers. Thrives on a broken play, separating vertically from trailing defensive backs. Gives excellent effort blocking downfield and near the line in the run game, using his strength and agility to mirror and sustain, showing aggressiveness when riding defenders well out of the play.",

Swope set the then-school record for receptions while starting all 13 games in 2010, catching 72 passes for 825 yards and four touchdowns, including a big game in aid of the Ryan  Tannehill-led upset of Oklahoma (8-136, TD).\nAs a junior, the 2011 second-team All-Big 12 pick by league coaches finished in the top 20 nationally (and set school records) in receptions (89) and receiving yardage (1,207) while grabbing 11 touchdowns from Tannehill, who eventually became a top-10 pick in the 2012 draft. His most memorable performance came against Baylor, when he covered 206 yards and scored four times (another A&M mark) on 11 catches.\nWith Tannehill gone, how much production Swope would have in his senior season was a question on the minds of many. Luckily for Swope and Texas A&M fans, Johnny Manziel rose to the occasion, and showed himself more than capable en route to the Heisman Trophy.

The dominance continued in his senior season (42 tackles, 11 for loss, 5 sacks), and he improved in many key areas -- most notably disengaging with offensive linemen and locating the football.\nThe Utah native was an all-state pick as a high school senior and signed to play for the same BYU Cougars team he grew up following, but he failed to qualify academically. He started his collegiate career with a great freshman year at Snow Junior College (52 tackles, 14 for loss, three sacks), but played at more than 350 pounds and quit football after the season because he questioned his passion for the sport. Sitting out made him miss the game, however, and Utah took a chance on his talent.

Hands are good, but not exceptional; will let some hot passes through his small hands and into his chest. Gets a lot of his yardage on shallow crosses, quick throws outside, and the fly sweep/\"touch pass.\" Might not have the chance to get the sideline as often at the next level, forcing him to lower the shoulder and get what's available to him inside. Must prove he can hang onto the ball after taking big hits from NFL defenders.

A huge part of the offensive success the Mountaineers have enjoyed over the last two seasons is due to the talent of Austin. A small but quick and elusive playmaker, Austin's role and impact grew seemingly by the week during his senior season, as he went from a slot man and returner to a fully fledged Swiss Army knife, including lining up in the backfield and taking handoffs.\nThe two-time Maryland high school player of the year set all kinds of state career and single-season records, a large share of which (34 touchdowns, 2,660 rushing yards -- that's 12.2 yards a carry) as a senior. WVU coaches couldn't wait to get him on the field, playing him in all 13 games and starting him in four. He caught 15 passes for 151 yards and a touchdown while racking up 476 kick return yards (including taking the opening kickoff against Connecticut 98 yards for a score). Big East coaches named him second-team all-conference in 2010 as he became a larger part of the passing game (58-787, 8 TD) and rushing attack (15-159, TD), but kicked him up to first team as a receiver (101-1,186, 8 TD) and returner (36 attempts for 938 yards, two TD on kickoffs; 19-268 on punts, ranked sixth in the FBS with a 14.1 yard average) after an excellent junior season. He led the FBS in all-purpose yards once his 182 rushing yards (one TD) were added in, and finished 2011 with 390 all-purpose yards and four touchdowns in the team's 70-33 blowout win over Clemson in the Orange Bowl.\nAustin burst into Heisman contention during his senior season with a 572 all-purpose yards (second most in FBS history) performance against Oklahoma on national television. Austin's full repertoire was on display, as he caught 4 passes for 82 yards, rushed 21 times for 344 yards and two touchdowns, and added 146 kick return yards. His dominating play saw him finish eighth in Heisman voting, win the Paul Hornung Award (most versatile player), and garner a first-team All-America as an All-Purpose player."

Unfortunately, the 2012 Sun Belt Defensive Player of the Year tore his ACL in November, ending his senior season after just ten games.

Plays the weak and strong sides of the formation, using extension and a bit more lower body strength than expected given his size to hold his own against right tackles. Hand use greatly improved between junior and senior seasons. Now possesses active, disruptive hands, constantly fighting for inside position and waxing blockers' hands off his body. Has the flexibility to dip his shoulder and reduce his surface area coming around the edge. Creative pass rusher who understands the art of the slow rush.  Gets the offensive tackle to over-commit, then beats him with a rip to the outside or swim to the inside. Makes plays on coverage units as an interior presence.",

Cheats back off the line of scrimmage obviously when twisting with the defensive tackle. Needs to continue adding bulk and filling out his frame. Good first step, but isn't lightning quick.

Smith might not have quite the athleticism of those two Pro Bowlers, but his potential as a hand-down or stand-up pass rusher is intriguing.\nQuanterus (pronounced quan-TERR-us) played in every game during his career with the Hilltoppers, starting two as a redshirt freshman (12 tackles, one for loss) before lining up with the first team 10 times the following year (47 tackles, 10.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks). Even though he only started six games of the 12 games in which he played in 2011, Sun Belt coaches still voted him second-team all-conference for his play, as his 11 tackles for loss (38 total) and 7.5 sacks gave opposing offenses headaches no matter when he stepped onto the gridiron. Smith's senior year got off to an excellent start. Through ten games, he was leading the nation in sacks with 12.5 before an ACL tear prematurely ended his season. His performance over those ten games was so dominating that he still finished as the FBS leader in sacks per game (1.25) and was named the 2012 Sun Belt Player of the year. It's unlikely that Smith will be able to contribute much in 2013, but if he checks out medically he could end up one of the steals of the draft."

Wagner was also a highly sought-after high school basketball player, earning multiple offers from lower-level Division 1 schools -' but the 80 pounds he gained in his first year or so after getting to campus cemented his status as an offensive lineman. He played 12 games as a redshirt freshman in 2009, and then got his chance to start 10 games when teammate Josh Oglesby went down with an injury the following year. Wagner garnered honorable mention All-Big Ten honors for the second straight year in 2011 as a first-year starter at left tackle. As a senior, Wagner continued that production until a right knee injury cut into his consecutive starts streak.

He moved to weak-side guard for eight starts in 13 games played as a sophomore, then started 10 more games there in 2011, missing two games with a leg injury.

Doesn't play like the typical former tight end, gets after defensive ends on the outside and can move tackles off the line in the run game with leverage and strong legs. Attacks ends in pass protection, rides them around the pocket. Flashes lateral movement and quick steps to cut off the edge (on twists, as well), mirror spin moves, or cut off the inside lane. Quick enough off the snap to reach block tackles or take linebackers out of the hole so running backs can cut back. Uses athleticism to take an end around the edge and then quickly get downfield to block on draw plays. Picks up interior blitzers instead of being taken outside by the end. Widens his base in pass protection to prevent getting bulled. Plays with attitude, will extend at the end of plays to finish when in position. Shows some recovery speed if taking a wrong step off the snap, should only improve there because of his athleticism. Attacks the inside shoulder in the running game to automatically put his body in the correct position. Shoulders are over toes when asked to immediately get to the second level. Continues to fight even if put in an awkward, losing position.",

Needs to hit his hands inside more consistently to control his target off the snap. Strength is lacking in his grip, can occasionally be thrown around or lunge forward because of it. Overaggressive at times in both pass pro and on run blocks, opponents take advantage of his leaning to push him upfield or get him off-balance. Will stop his feet at times while the play continues, allowing his man to get into plays if they are extended. Inconsistent getting down quickly on his cut blocks, though opponents find it hard to get around them. Must consistently move his feet after latching onto his opponent to prevent getting shed.",

After playing on special teams as a true freshman, he started five games in 2010, catching nine passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against Iowa. Fragel started four games in his junior year, but continued to be mostly used as a blocker in the run game (five receptions, 64 yards) for a team lacking a great passing offense."

He played in all 13 games as a reserve his true freshman season (24, two for loss, interception) before redshirting in 2009 due to the team's depth at the position. Taylor earned a starting job in 2010 (35 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss, two sacks, two pass breakups, three forced fumbles) and also started the first nine games of 2011 before a stress fracture in his leg forced him to sit four full games plus most of another. He returned at less than 100 percent for the Broncos' Las Vegas Bowl win over Arizona State, returning an interception 100 yards for a touchdown (he finished the year with 27 tackles, two for loss, two INT, six pass breakups). As a senior, Taylor started every game while registering 51 total tackles, 3.5 went for loss including 2.5 sacks. He added nine pass breakups,  four interceptions, and three forced fumbles.

Excellent mobility given his size, has no issues moving behind the line or pulling in front of plays -- hitting multiple targets at times. Solid on combo blocks when maintaining his bend, and also displays the footwork to get the outside angle on run blocks, move well on zone plays, and also sustain while his man is trying to spin out of pass pro blocks.

Struggles to keep his hands inside of the defender, and will \"catch\" his assignment. Seems to second-guess himself in space or get glancing blows instead of driving his man to the ground.

Covers a lot of ground in the secondary when deep, can change directions effectively to get angles to prevent explosive plays. Strong enough to win 50/50 scenarios with receivers in coverage.

                    "Bottom Line": "This tenacious hitter originally planned on going to Tennessee, but the resignation of Phillip Fulmer sent him into the arms of Steve Spurrier at South Carolina. He's played in every game since he arrived on campus, except for the 2012 matchup against Missouri, for which he was suspended after a hit on a defenseless receiver. He has played both free and strong safety, and his good performances as a spot duty at corner against big receivers suggests he has the potential to cover NFL tight ends in coverage well. He projects to be a day two pick.",
                    "NFL Comparison": "T.J. Ward",
                    "Strengths": "High-motor, downhill run and pass defender who throws his body around, but with some control. Big hitter over the middle on receivers and pounding running backs, especially in tight quarters and as a backside pursuit defender. Good lateral movement to flow with runs from the back half, yet fly into the hole to prevent big runs. Feisty in-the-box defender who out-quicks or swims over lead blocks and fights through the whistle. Has experience at a variety of positions, and lines up against receivers regularly, using his physicality, agility, and knowledge of routes to stay with them across or down the field. Has the range to split the field in half in two-deep coverage. Effective blitzer off the edge, brings force into fullback blocks and quarterback hits. Competes for the ball while the receiver is making the catch, as he does in every other part of his game. Makes the easy interception on poor throws, but also snatches and dives for tougher picks.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Average height for the position, though he has good thickness in his lower body. Best in a two-deep look, might not have the range to make plays and length to take on deep routes in single-high, although South Carolina often asks him to fulfill this role. More of an enforcer against receivers than backs. Prone to leaving his feet and goes low on tackles (especially in space), pro backs might avoid them more easily in the open field. NFL quarterbacks might take advantage of his aggressive nature, as he will jump underneath routes. Gets overly physical with receivers, sometimes crossing the pass interference line because he lacks the pure speed to keep up. Straddles the line with trash talk and hits through the whistle. Will likely get flagged and fined for overly-aggressive play.",

Swearinger originally committed to Tennessee, but the resignation of then-head coach Phillip Fulmer caused a switch to South Carolina, where Steve Spurrier was more than happy to see him. An enforcer in the middle of the field, Swearinger is an incredibly productive and physical defender who has played every position in the secondary for South Carolina.\nSwearinger played in all 13 games of his true freshman year for the Gamecocks (19 tackles), and then saw more time on defense as a sophomore, starting eight games while moving between free and strong safety (66 tackles, interception, five pass break-ups).  He took more of a leadership role as a junior, starting every game, moving from strong safety to free safety in the third week of the year (80 tackles, three interceptions, three pass break-ups). In his senior season he was as productive as ever (80 tackles, two interceptions, seven pass break-ups) and saw his role grow even further, notching a significant amount of snaps at cornerback when injuries decimated the position for South Carolina."

Does not give much ground against single or double blocks. Shows the agility to spin off blocks and move to the ball down the line. Provides pressure up the middle with a swim move or quick movement into either A-gap. Quick enough to chase quarterbacks trying to leave the pocket if free from his block, can also force cut backs by ballcarriers by his effort to the ball in the backfield. Works hard to hold the line using his lower body strength, and can split doubles to get to the ball in tight quarters. Flashes violent hands to rip off man-up blocks.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Needs to use his hands more consistently to control his man and gain leverage. Can struggle to disengage to make plays. Will anticipate the snap at times, jumping offside or getting off-balance so centers can control him. Lacks closing speed and the ability to break down to make many plays outside the box against elusive ballcarriers. Takes time to recover once on the ground.

Hughes has shown off his agility and strength inside during his time at Tennessee-Martin, however, enticing scouts enough to consider him at least a valuable rotational NFL player.\nHughes wound up with 106 tackles, 25 for loss and 13 sacks as a senior at Murfreesboro High School, and his performance at the Toyota East-West All-Star Classic caused UT to have great interest in his services. He enrolled in school in January of 2009, participating in spring practice so he could be prepared to play every game with the Volunteers in his first fall on campus (20 tackles, two for loss). He began his sophomore year as a starter, lining up with the ones the first five games (including once against UTM) before going to a reserve role the rest of the year (17 tackles, 3.5 for loss, one sack).

Making that sort of play as a sophomore, and building on it over the next two years, has allowed scouts to project him as mid to late-round pick.\nGratz was a first-team all-region pick in Piscataway, N.J., as well as an all-county pick in track (he set the school record in the 55-meter hurdles), but Big East rival Rutgers couldn't lock him up. In his redshirt freshman season, he played in all 13 games, coming on to start four of the last five games of the regular season (20 tackles, four pass break-ups). He started all 13 games of UConn's co-Big East championship 2010 season (63 tackles, two interceptions, nine pass break-ups) that unfortunately ended with the BCS bowl loss to the Sooners.

Good mobility to pull, gets around the line quickly and has the flexibility to adjust to inside defenders once through the hole. Fits on his second-level block well and engulfs the defender.",

The senior might have a tendency to sail targets and force some poor reads, but multiple teams will likely consider adding Nassib as an early starter, not just a backup or developmental prospect as many suspected prior to this season.",

Comes off initial read, can look off safety to come to the opposite side of the field. Willing to shovel the ball or make a last-ditch throw to make a play instead of taking a sack. Displays the ability to step up within the pocket or move to either side to create space to throw. Flashes air, touch, and accuracy on fades in the end zone. Puts a lot of air under deep balls, giving his man a chance to make a play. Sells play action and screens well. Places the ball on the run, especially to his right. Competitive player who directs his teammates well and does not give up on any game. Tough enough to take big hits, bull for a first down with his feet.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Possesses only average height for the position. Gunslinger mentality causes him to trust his arm and receivers too much, resulting in bad decisions/turnovers. Not in elite in his mobility or elusiveness outside the pocket, won't run away from NFL defenders. Footwork is inconsistent, gets happy and actually hops around when trying to find a target. Must be more consistent transferring weight through the throw, relies on his strong arm at times and comes up short on outs or sails throws over the middle. Works nearly exclusively out of the shotgun, but has athleticism to handle plays under center.",

The toughness he's shown on the field and his progression as a passer over the past four years, however, hasn't escaped the notice of NFL scouts for teams looking for a strong-armed passer with mobility. In fact, with his college head coach Doug Marrone now coaching the Buffalo Bills, many have connected the dots and are projecting Nassib as a top-50 selection.\nHe was the backup to Duke basketball transfer Greg Paulus as a redshirt freshman in 2009, then stepped into the starting job the following season (2,334 yards, 19 scores, eight interceptions) for a 8-5 team that won the Pinstripe Bowl over Kansas State thanks to his three touchdown throws. Though Nassib set school single-season records for completions (259), passing yards (2,685) and tied the top mark in touchdown passes (22) in 2011, the 5-7 Orange couldn't reach the postseason. As a senior, Nassib looked in complete command of the Orange offense, completing 294-of-471 attempts for 3,749 yards on the way to tossing 26 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He continued to show off his mobility by picking up 142 rushing yards and two touchdowns while Syracuse finished with an 8-5 record."

Does not have the size to prevent defenders from crossing his face when awaiting targets in a short zone. Surprised by the pass too often, gets to him too quickly and struggles to turn head with hands at the ready. Limited route tree. Mostly targeted on quick screens and go routes. Struggles to avoid contact when dealing with physical coverage, and gets stuck vs. pressing corners at the line of scrimmage. Breaking routes are rounded with a lack of explosiveness.

That sort of athleticism, along with the quickness and elusiveness he showed between the lines during this football career, will likely appeal to teams seeking a dynamic weapon in their offense.\nHis work on the track didn't prevent him from playing immediately for the Longhorns on the gridiron. Goodwin played 14 games as a true freshman, starting two at receiver (30-279, TD) and returning kicks (16-349, TD).

Stuffs fullback blocks and holds his ground to stop linemen if unable to beat their blocks. Flashes the ability to pop off or swipe away linemen with his hands to grab backs in his immediate area. Does not mind getting in on piles or cleaning them up. Fights to take care of his responsibility, working the blocks all the way to the edge.

After one season behind Luke Stocker, he began really using his hands and athleticism to help the Volunteers in 2011 and 2012.

Runs tough and will stiff-arm oncoming defenders after the catch. Flashes athleticism to leap defenders and flexibility to avoid linebackers on crossers. Gives good effort as an in-line blocker, moves his feet, extends his strong arms, and usually gets his hands on his target's numbers. Willing to sustain throughout the play against ends or linebackers, also against second-level targets from a stand-up position. Also does his job when lined up as a lead blocker in the backfield.",

Straight-line speed and explosion off the line are also average, might not separate from NFL linebackers consistentlyl. Lateral quickness is also average, can be out-quicked on the edge to allow his man into the play, ends up on the ground at times when blocking on the move from the backfield.",

Two transfers later, Rivera himself is looking like a potential contributor on Sunday using his athleticism and strong hands.\nInstead of sitting out a season transferring from Oregon to another FBS program, he played for the successful College of the Canyons JUCO program (32 receptions, 316 yards, three touchdowns) in 2009. He picked Tennessee as his next home out of a range of suitors, and played all 13 games for the Volunteers (managing 11 receptions for 112 yards) as a sophomore back-up to another NFL-caliber performer in Luke Stocker. Finally getting his chance to start in 2011, he lined up with the first team in all 12 games, covering 344 yards and scoring once on his 29 catches. This year, as a senior, Rivera caught 36 passes for 562 yards and five touchdowns."

King is working hard to present himself in that manner.\nConsidered one of the top strong-side defensive end recruits in the nation as a Houston-area high school star, King was expected to make a big impact for the Sooners early on. But as a redshirt freshman in 2009, he played in just four games (one tackle) on a deep defensive line.

Good second effort even when beaten with initial hand play, can close on quarterbacks and running backs coming to his side and he chases from the back side. Presents good bend for his size in a three-point stance. Length and increased upper-body strength helps him reach ball carriers and pop/drag them down with authority. Excellent at inside stunts and slant. Quickness helps him win the B-gap even when lined up outside the tackle, also helps him get to the sideline to chase down ball carriers. Tight ends have little chance of handling his rip move on the outside. Moves well when standing up, has the change of direction ability to contain on his side, handle himself against tight ends off the line and in short zone coverage as a 3-4 'backer.

Still learning to use his flexibility to turn the corner consistently, and needs to use his spin move (and keep his balance during it) to prevent getting taken outside the pocket too often. More of a coordinated and fluid athlete than a downright explosive one. Doesn't like to hold his ground and set the edge on runs at him, preferring to run himself upfield or dance around the block.

He started every game at left tackle as a true freshman (something he might not have done at one of those other schools) in 2010, garnering honorable mention All-Big 12 honors while first-round quarterback Ryan Tannehill (selected by Miami, where Sherman is now the offensive coordinator, with the eighth overall pick in 2012) led the team to a bowl appearance.\nNew Aggies coach Kevin Sumlin took over for former head coach Mike Sherman, and the Aggies (led by Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel) took the SEC by storm. Joeckel had a standout year, as he and Matthews anchored the best offensive line in the country.

He is a boom-or-bust prospect. Mingo's production dropped as a junior, and he failed to show much overall growth in his game over the course of his career.

Not a contact-shy player despite his slight build, often lines up on the strong side and/or inside of tight ends in a tight alignment. Strong player setting the edge against the run. Willing to take on tackles man-up, extends his arms to keep distance and can get off to grab backs trying to get through the hole. Takes tight ends into the background using his length and footwork. Works through blocks to get down the line to chase plays. Overall agility and length make him effective in coverage, can stay with running backs out of the backfield and wrap up receivers in space. Excellent straight-line speed shows when chasing down plays from behind. Uses his length and jumping ability to knock down passes if unable to reach the quarterback.",

Needs to shed more consistently to prevent plays from getting outside of him. Long legs get in his way at times when trying to change directions quickly. Often gets too focused on scrapping with his blocker instead of getting his eyes in the backfield to find the ball. Did not progress in terms of pass rush moves during his career. Great player off the snap of the ball, but too often allows the offensive tackle to recover because he lacks a move to disengage.",

There were some anxious moments before the 2011 season as well, because Richardson needed to finish course work in August before the NCAA deemed he was eligible to play for the Tigers. He played through a shoulder injury (which required surgery in the offseason) and only started two games on the year, but made enough plays as a reserve (37 tackles, eight for loss, two sacks) to garner honorable mention All-Big 12 honors from league coaches.\nMissouri's move to the SEC coincided with Richardson taking over one of the starting defensive tackle positions.

He's one of the best athletes at his position, and that derives from Ogletree's history at safety, where he played as a freshman, making five starts in 2010. Heading into his sophomore season, Ogletree continued to grow, and the coaching staff asked him to move to inside linebacker. That was until he suffered a broken right foot in the season-opener against Boise State and missed the following six games. He returned to the field against Florida and went on to earn the team's David Jacobs Award as a player who, by example, portrays courage, spirit, character and determination.\nAt safety as a freshman, Ogletree recorded 34 total tackles, one of which went for a loss.

His size, power, and athleticism made him a two-time all-state pick at Southeastern High School, but his hustle in combination with those physical attributes is what gives him a chance to be a first round prospect in much the same way Dan 'Big Daddy' Wilkinson was with the Buckeyes before he became the last defensive tackle selected No. 1 overall by the Cincinnati Bengals in 1994.\nOhio State coaches liked what they saw from 'Big Hank' as a true freshman in 2010 (16 tackles, 1.5 for loss) so much that they played him in every game and named him the team's most outstanding first-year defender. As a sophomore, he was the Buckeyes' most outstanding defensive player and earned honorable mention All-Big Ten honors (by coaches and media) after making 68 stops, 11 for loss and three sacks. Hankins still decided to slim down a bit after the 2011 season to add increased stamina and quickness. He started all 12 games for the Buckeyes as a junior again and earned First Team All-Big Ten honors with 55 tackles, 4 for loss and one sack. Knowing his combination of size, strength and quickness would be attractive at the next level, Hankins decided to skip his senior year in Columbus and go pro."

He was Notre Dame's No. 1 offensive weapon in 2012, lining up as a WR or as a traditional TE, and was a target defensive coordinators had to game-plan against. Eifert is a fluid pass-catcher with vacuum hands and the hand/eye coordination to make tough catches, and although he doesn't create a lot of space, he secures grabs in traffic, showing outstanding tracking and high-pointing ability. He is a soft-spoken guy, but an animal on the field and a much better blocker than advertised, improving in leaps and bounds the past three years with excellent effort. Projects as a starting NFL TE with excellent potential as both a receiver and blocker.",

Lines up with his hand down, in an H-back role, in the slot and outside. Threatens the seam with his long strides off the snap, takes a lot of hits across the middle and bounces up. Nice job gaining position in coverage with very good footwork, taking pride in his routes and showing much improvement in this area. Elevates well to go up and attack the ball, just needs an opportunity and chances are he'll come down with it -- very good at mid-air adjustments, making a lot of catches with his feet off the ground. Uses his height, length and strong hands to snatch passes out of the air. Flashes quick feet on out-cuts to be an effective safety valve. Fights through arm tackles to get extra yardage. Gets off the line effectively from a three-point stance, can shimmy past a defender near the line to get into his route. Gives effort as an in-line blocker, uses his length to hold off defensive ends, uses agility to get angle and create outside running lane. Also works hard to prevent defenders from reaching teammates downfield. Productive in his three seasons, leaving Notre Dame with just about every school receiving record for a TE including catches (140) and receiving yards (1,840).",
                    "Weaknesses": "Lean receiver-like build. Does not play with consistent explosiveness and leverage when blocking in-line, will get pulled down by NFL ends and miss reach-blocks against quicker ends. Still growing as a blocker and needs to use better angles. Stronger linebackers will rip off his blocks and ride him off his route when he does not use his hands effectively. Allows throws into his body on occasion, will drop the ball when trying to run before securing.",

Eifert decided to skip his final season of eligibility and enter the 2013 NFL Draft.\nThe son of former Purdue basketball player Greg Eifert led all FBS tight ends with 63 grabs for 803 yards in 2011, and his five touchdowns made him a nice red-zone complement to first-round receiver Michael Floyd.

Doesn't exhibit much balance or flexibility, struggling to turn the corner consistently and getting pushed around the pocket. Better tackles can stone him on his first move, lacks a consistent counter move to get free. Does not run through tight ends when he has the size advantage.

Experienced as a two-gapper, keeps his eyes in the backfield and sheds to either direction to grab running backs coming his direction.

Tendency to stop his feet on contact. While he has experience two-gapping, he still needs a lot of technique work in that area; he has a tendency to turn his body, especially against double teams, causing him to get washed out or moved upfield.

Allen scored six times on the year to increase his career touchdown total to 11. Injuries and poor quarterback play marred Allen's 2012 season. He missed 2012 spring practices after having surgery on his ankle from an off-season basketball injury, and missed the final three games with a knee issue. Even though Cal struggled to get the ball into his hands (61 catches, 737 yards, 6 TDs), when Allen was on the field in 2012, he was as big, fast, and imposing a target as ever, and he was awarded as an Honorable Mention Pac-12 selection."

Misses tackles when lunging at ball carriers and when leaving his feet. Hands are by his waist at the snap instead of higher to punch more quickly. Can be disinterested when play goes to receiver he is not responsible for in man coverage; closing speed lacks urgency. Does not have experience inside as a slot corner in nickel. Performance takes a step back in zone coverage, struggles to pass off and close on receivers entering or leaving his area. Looks sluggish or tight hipped when not asked to mirror movements.

Rhodes was lucky to line up behind pass rushers like Brandon Jenkins, Bjoern Werner and Tank Carradine, but they were equally as thankful to play with a defensive back who refused to give his opposition a sliver of separation. The imposing corner does have some injuries on record, including one to his hand after only three games in 2009 and a gruesome knee injury in 2011 that turned out to be a bad sprain.\nAs a redshirt freshman in 2010, Rhodes started all 14 games at the boundary corner position and registered 58 tackles, 3.5 of which went for a loss, including two sacks. He added 12 pass breakups, including four interceptions. Rhodes was forced to play in a three-man rotation in 2011, and his numbers show it. He still had 43 tackles, 1.5 for a loss. Along with the tackle numbers, Rhodes added four pass breakups including an interception. Finally, in 2012, Rhodes regained his full-time place on the boundary side of the formation, tallying 39 tackles, two of which went for a loss.

Gio was slowed early in the 2012 season after experiencing some discomfort in his knee in the opener against Elon, and the running back was sidelined for two full games. The redshirt sophomore did return to the field against East Carolina and remained there for the next nine games.\nAfter taking over lead back duties as a redshirt freshman, Bernard rushed for 1,253 yards and 13 touchdowns on 239 carries.

Not afraid to get physical as a blocker and gives good effort in this area, always looking for someone to block downfield. Tracks the ball well and does a nice job adjusting his frame to make the tough catch, extending and plucking. Looks like he has glue on his hands with some of the catches he is able to make. Does a nice job selling his patterns, getting good depth in his routes and immediately looking for the ball out of his breaks. Nice job deceiving defenders and finding soft spots in coverage to make something happen after the catch, averaging over 13 yards per catch in 2012. Has experience all over the offense for Stanford, lining up in-line, slot and out wide, but looked most comfortable in the slot.

Misses second-level blocks when lunging at targets instead of getting position. Nice job adding bulk to his frame, but needs to continue to develop his strength to sustain blocks at the line of scrimmage.

Takes very good angles and lines. Stops momentum of blockers, rolls into them with an anchor to not lose ground. Finishes off tackles very well. Fights as a blitzer, good motor, attempts to run through or get around contact. Sniffs out screens. When the play is visibly in from of him, the click and close can happen very quickly. Looks very comfortable when using hands to work through blockers. Has just enough speed to undercut blocks and make tackles for loss. Remained on the field in nickel packages.",

Lacks desirable range in coverage because of lost ground when forced to open up hips, turn, and run. Fast enough in a straight line, but lateral speed may be a question. Despite good angles, likely won't win a foot race to the edge. Too flat footed on play action and misdirection, but at least that prohibits wasted steps.

As the top rated defensive back in the state of New Jersey, Ryan decided to stay home and attend Rutgers.\nHe redshirted his first season on campus, and made his debut in 2010. Ryan participated in 11 games, and he recorded 9 tackles, including one for loss, and one pass breakup. In 2011, Ryan moved into a starting role at corner. He played in all 13 games, and tallied 67 tackles (5.5 for loss), two forced fumbles, 13 pass breakups, and three interceptions. He was selected to the All-Big East team. As a redshirt junior in 2012, Ryan logged 94 tackles (5 for loss), 17 pass breakups, and four interceptions in 13 games. Once again, Ryan was an All-Big East selection."

His tackles stats aren't overwhelming as part of a strong LSU tackle rotation, but his leverage at the point of attack and short-area quickness give him the tools to succeed in the NFL.

Nice lateral quickness to step into a gap after the snap, can penetrate through to get a hand on the ballcarrier or hold his ground with a shoulder against single blocks to stuff the hole. Plays with leverage when man-up and against double-teams, doesn't get moved off the line often. Flashes the violent hands and pop to shed and eat up backs coming into his area. Works hard as a pass rusher, can use his hands and strength to bull through the shoulder of his man to reach the quarterback if the ball stays in the pocket too long. Strong tackler who swallows ballcarriers when in position and also slows them with an arm even if engaged.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Not elite in his initial quickness, will be stoned more consistently by NFL linemen unless it improves and might be taken out in obvious passing situations. Might be best as an athletic nose, rather than a three-technique. Inconsistent getting off blocks inside to two-gap, lunges towards ballcarriers after they're already by him. Gets overaggressive on his punch on occasion and doesn't have elite upper-body strength, so better linemen and double teams can get his shoulders turned out of the hole. Stamina is an issue, losing his chase ability and short-area quickness when facing strong competition, and forces him to be heavily rotated. Has difficulty seeing and handling cut blocks. Doesn't offer much as a pass rushing threat.",

San Diego Chargers third-round pick Brandon Taylor also wore No. 18 for the Bayou Bengals, following in the footsteps of former Chargers fullback Jacob Hester and the initial wearer, 2003 BCS championship quarterback Matt Mauck. Logan isn't going to be one to put up gaudy statistics, but his strength in the middle of the line won't elude the eyes of scouts looking for a starting tackle.\nThe two-time Class 2A first-team All-State pick from Louisiana dominated his high school competition (116 tackles, 30 for loss, 15 sacks as a senior), but was only a three-star recruit as a defensive end. He redshirted the 2009 season and played just three games in 2010, posting only five tackles that season playing behind a deep, talented front four as he added the necessary weight to play in the middle in the SEC. He stepped into a starting role in 2011 next to 2012 first-round pick Michael Brockers, using his increased bulk and maintained athleticism to rack up 57 stops, 6.5 for loss and three sacks, saving his best for last with six tackles, 1.5 for loss and a sack against Alabama in the team's BCS title game loss. In his junior season, Logan totaled 45 tackles, with 5.5 for loss, and two sacks."

Hopkins re-wrote the Clemson receiving record books in 2012 with 18 receiving touchdowns (the No. 2 player in the ACC was NC State's Bryan Underwood with 10).

Does a nice job creating separation and deceiving defensive backs with head fakes and quick moves. Will threaten the top of defenses with NFL-quality straight-line speed. Possesses strong hands in traffic, not afraid of contact downfield and can separate at the last second with an arm extension. Agile enough to quickly avoid oncoming defenders after the catch yet remain balanced to head downfield for the big gain. Does not go down without a fight, can run through arm tackle attempts from cornerbacks. Snatches throws with his hands. Concentrates on the ball throughout difficult catches. Very good body control to contort his body on catches and pluck the ball out of the air. Effective run blocker, usually reaches his target and gets his hands up, uses correct blocking angle to sustain; also shows some nastiness at times, capable of putting his man to the ground. Consistently productive over his time at Clemson, improving his stats each season.",

Occasionally loses track of the ball on easy catches when trying to make a move too early. Must prove his ability to use his hands to beat press coverage from NFL veterans off the line. Dances around defenders and run backward after short catches at times. Will need to be more consistently physical in the blocking game at the next level.",

Hopkins earned the team's Rookie of the Year award in 2010, starting eight of 12 games and leading the team with 52 catches (covering 637 yards and four touchdowns). He joined the Clemson basketball team as a reserve after the season, one year after leading his high school team to a state title. He played in every game, starting 11, as a sophomore in 2011, being somewhat overlooked despite nearly reaching 1,000 receiving yards (978 on 72 catches, also five touchdowns) because of the electric play of freshman Sammy Watkins. Hopkins suffered a mild concussion in a car accident on his way to the team's disappointing 70-33 Orange Bowl loss to West Virginia, but he still managed a school bowl-record 10 catches for 107 yards and a touchdown. Hopkins was good over his first two seasons in Death Valley, but in 2012 he was great, finishing with a single-season school record 1,405 receiving yards. Hopkins also set a new ACC mark with 18 receiving scores, adding a team-best 82 catches. Despite his quarterback deciding to return for his senior season, Hopkins decided to depart after his record-breaking junior season, leaving with a school record for 100-yard receiving games (12)."

Has improved his anchor against bull-rushes, wide base and length make him tough to move. Flashes footwork to reach linebackers at the second level, who can't separate from him once he locks on.

Fluker redshirted his first season in 2009, watching Alabama win its first BCS title under head coach Nick Saban. Saban and his staff didn't waste any time getting Fluker on the field the following year, starting him at right tackle in the 2010 season opener. An injured groin cost him four starts and three games that year, but SEC coaches saw enough in his nine starts to put him on the Freshman All-SEC team. He stayed healthy in his sophomore year, starting all 13 games at right tackle while the team won its second BCS title in three years.

He was a first-team All-Pac-10 pick at kick returner (971 yards with a TD against Minnesota) and received honorable mention notice at receiver (65 receptions for 792 yards and six touchdowns).

It may have been with a humorous tone, but after the team's bowl game Woods stated that \"if the coaches wanted to keep me another year, they would've probably got me the ball.\" Quarterback Matt Barkley reiterated Woods' sentiments, adding that the offense seemed to focus too much on getting sophomore stud receiver Marqise Lee the ball.

Randle doesn't have the explosiveness in his game right now to be picked as early as his former teammates, but another big season leading the Cowboys offense using his growing strength and shifty hips '- without Weeden and Blackmon taking most of the pressure '- ensured scouts his production wasn't simply a byproduct of the system and others' talent.\nThe presence of Kendall Hunter limited Randle's carries in 2010, but the true freshman had at least one tote in all 13 games (82 total for 452 yards and two touchdowns) and caught 37 passes for 427 yards on the year. He stepped into Hunter's shoes admirably as a sophomore, earning second-team All-Big 12 honors with 1,216 rushing yards and 24 touchdowns in spite of Oklahoma State's passing preference; he did not have 20 or more carries in any game after the first month of the season. His 152 yards and four touchdowns helped OSU beat Robert Griffin III and Baylor and he covered 151 yards in the team's beat-down of the rival Oklahoma Sooners. Despite the team's rotation at the quarterback position, Randle remained the constant figure in the Cowboys' offense in 2012. He rushed for 1,417 yards and 14 touchdowns on 274 carries.

While his body type is a better fit for 3-4 outside linebacker than 4-3 defensive end, his hips appear to be too stiff to make the transition. Lemonier also lacks powerful hands, and sometime struggles to turn the corner. The fact that Lemonier does not quit on plays, and has a good motor, combined with his athletic potential will likely cast him as a second or third rounder, despite some serious questions about the translating of his play to the next level.",

Can threaten outside shoulders of average linemen, and works an impressive rip move on the outside. Has strength and long arms to separate the ball from any ballcarrier. Works hard throughout each play, chasing plays to the sideline when needed and crashing inside for a secondary rush if stopped in his initial upfield move. Works well on twists inside, closes hard and gets into passing lanes if unable to reach the quarterback. Strong arm extension to knock back and shed linemen or tight ends in the run game. Good vision through traffic and hustle to reach the ball. Frame makes him susceptible to cut blocks, but he recovers quite well, gets back into the play to make a stop with pure effort.",

The National Freshman of the Year by many media outlets also earned a spot on the Walter Camp All-American second team and first-team All-SEC accolades from league coaches after rushing for 1,197 yards and 17 scores his first year on campus. Only Heisman Trophy winner and NFL star back George Rogers ran for more yards in school history (in 1979 and 1980).

He suffered a season-ending torn left ACL against Mississippi State, however, which led to six missed games and a November surgery.

In most cases, sharing a name with a former first-round pick is a bonus.

He became the top prospect out of Michigan in 2010 (he had 27 sacks as a senior at Detroit Southeast), so it was no surprise when got on the field as a true freshman. He had 13 tackles (0.5 sack) in 10 games before tearing his left labrum (shoulder) against Minnesota. Gholston recovered from surgery well enough to start 12 games in 2011, earning second-team All-Big Ten honors with 70 tackles, 16 tackles for loss and five sacks. His five tackles for loss and two sacks helped the Spartans beat Georgia 33-30 in the Outback Bowl.

Drops his hips, has quick enough feet and a solid head-fake to separate at the top of the route, as well as to pull off double-moves downfield and to the sideline. Tries to run through tackles by lowering his pads and churning his feet after the catch and has a bit of open-field elusiveness, though he will run backwards and dance too much instead of taking what he can get.

Hands reliably is severely lacking, misses on all difficulty of catches due to a lack of concentration. Doesn't adjust to low passes as well as he does high ones.

He also ranked fifth in the nation with five forced fumbles and garnered the Cotton Bowl Most Outstanding Player for his work (INT, sack, two forced fumbles) in the win over Texas A&M.\nThe first thing NFL scouts see when they look at Mathieu is his size, or lack thereof. Sometimes physical attributes must be overlooked for players who can make something happen on defense while also turning the tide on special teams (fourth in the nation with 16.2 yards per punt returns in 2011, one of two scores coming in the SEC Championship Game). The issue for Mathieu is how much teams will be willing to believe his off the field troubles are in the past."

Excellent first three steps off the line to challenge corners, shakes them off the line and has enough speed to get a step down the field. Stems every route in the tree with foot quickness that college corners can't handle, does not have to slow down significantly to make a cut. Tracks the ball well over either shoulder, and shows a good job of high pointing the football in contested situations. Creates space downfield with an arm extension. Tough to bring down after the catch because of his low center of gravity and strength. Aggressive run blocker with the strength to negate his man and stick with the block. Willing to attack safeties stepping up inside if uncovered.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Might be limited to purely playing the slot. Does not bring some difficult catches extended away from his frame that top prospects are expected to snare with their hands. Some college corners could close on him in the open field. Will fall off run blocks instead of sustaining, allowing his man to come off and make a play at times.",

He drives forward in these situations, specifically with the inside armbar to cut off the shorter path. Flashes a mean attitude to finish off plays, takes opponents down that have lost their balance. Can really get after it, an attacker rather than passive blocker. Brings the club with one hand when wanting to release in space on screen plays. Doesn't wait on blocks at the second level, on the offensive and seeks out contact. If uncovered he always helps inside in pass protection and delivers a nice punch.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Not an ideal build for an offensive lineman, thin in the arms. Many difficulties arise form pass blocking on an island. Beaten around the edge without slowing the rusher down and can lose face up against stiff contact due to not having the ability to stop backwards momentum. Move to guard is likely in his future. Deep drop steps aren't natural and stiff contact jolts him mid-stride. Loses on counter moves, thrown to the side when top heavy or leaning too far over, specifically when run blocking.

Plays with good balance. Quick off the ball. Recognizes stunts and blitzes well, and has the coordination to execute multiple blocks in these situations.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Limited experience and played against weak competition. Will likely have to move to guard, due to a lack of length. Lacks core strength. While he's light on his feet, his foot quickness needs to improve.",

He was named to the Class C all-state second-team as a senior. Tretter also starred in basketball, graduating as Akron Central's all-time leading scorer and rebounder. A four-year starter and three-time all-league first-team selection, Tretter was named Western New York Player of the Year and to the All-Western New York third team as a senior.\nTretter played tight end in his first two seasons at Cornell, but moved to tackle, and helped the team's offensive immensely. He started each of his final 20 games at left tackle and is the first offensive lineman to earn All-Ivy League First Team honors since Kevin Boothe in 2005."
