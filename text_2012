Emmanuel_Acho 2532781 204
--NAME-- is a strong physical talent out of Texas who has been a productive force inside for the Longhorns the past two years. There are certain hitches in his athletic ability and running motion that inhibit him on the field, but he shows up consistently and knows how to tackle and play well in the box. he should contribute on special teams at the next level and seems to have the temperament to contribute there. He is a fifth- or sixth-round talent based on his ability to contribute early.
--NAME-- can get dominated by bigger offensive linemen and struggles to disengage at times. He is a decent athlete who can look awkward when pursuing long or dropping in his pass set at times. He is a bit undersized and can't maul tight ends at the line to get them off route; he also struggles in coverage when having to run with them. Other than on special teams, he won't be a very reliable inside presence early on.
--NAME-- is an instinctual inside linebacker who usually takes a good first step toward the ball off the snap. He is good to meet running backs inside and fill a gap, if not two, to make a play and get the ball carrier to the ground. --NAME-- is proficient sifting through blockers outside, and is a better tackler from the inside-out in pursuit than he is meeting at the point. He understands how to time blitzes and work against offensive linemen to get pressure on the quarterback.
-------------------------
Joe_Adams 2532782 104
--NAME-- was an electrifying player as a senior. Many will remember his punt return against Tennessee earlier in the year, and that would be a good representation of the type of explosiveness and talent --NAME-- will bring to the next level. Though he does have the skills to excel at the wide receiver position, his ability to return kicks immediately will boost his value in many teams' minds. He has good vision in the open field and the explosiveness and agility to make people miss and turn up the field. The type of returner/receiver who looks to score each time he has the ball, --NAME-- will look to contribute in many facets at the next level. He should expect to be picked somewhere in the second round.
--NAME-- is not a very tough player in traffic, and he uses his body to try to secure the catch too often, which leads to drops. He is hesitant as a blocker and not strong enough to keep corners engaged. He needs to play more physical to be effective at the next level.
--NAME-- has an agility and quick burst that makes it possible for him to make one move and see daylight. This serves him well as a returner and a slot receiver. He is a natural, savvy ball carrier and displays a smoothness when catching bubble screens and quick passes of that sort. His best trait is his ability to separate at the top of routes even when blanketed. He can stick his foot in the ground to snap out of his breaks. Corners often inadvertently fly by as he snaps off curl routes. He is a patient runner who runs fluidly and even has the athletic ability to change speeds and set corners up in-phase before breaking hard one way to get himself open. He has the long speed to get open deep. He has a professional understanding of how to run routes at his size and stem off the ball to gain separation. He is a very polished receiver, and his athletic ability should serve him well at the next level working out of the slot.
-------------------------
Mike_Adams 2532783 56
--NAME-- has flashed talent at left tackle for the Buckeyes, not allowing many sacks when actually on the field. Suspensions for violating team rules and his part in Ohio State's "Tattoo Five" scandal, as well as various injuries, have kept him on the sideline too often during his career. He is not a flashy player, but he can do the job and has the frame for the next level. He will be more of a backup option when he enters the NFL and would struggle if thrown into a starting role. Based off his experience at a big-time school and frame, he should be taken somewhere in the later rounds.
--NAME-- is not a very exciting player and can struggle at times with effort-based issues that don't allow him to get much movement on the line when run-blocking. He is more of a catch-and-react blocker than one who delivers blows, and will need to play with more fire and look to unleash his inner-athleticism to be able to succeed at the next level. Those suspensions and injuries will also eat away at his draft stock.
--NAME-- has a good frame and good enough footwork to not get beat at the college level. He employs a decent pass set to get back and anchor himself against the bull rush, and has the footwork to shuffle and keep his feet chopping when blocking to drive a man downfield in the run game. His big-game experience playing at Ohio State helps his value.
-------------------------
Antonio_Allen 2532786 242
--NAME-- is an experienced, versatile SEC defensive back who has played the rover position for South Carolina. He is very active and plays the run extremely well. Some will question his value as a safety because he didn't play the true safety position in college, but his athletic ability and tendency to be actively involved in every play in the box gives him value to teams looking to add run support. He is somewhat limited in pass defense due to playing so close in the box, but he has third-round value and could ascend from there.
The fact that --NAME-- didn't start at a true safety position in college hurts his value. He struggles at times in transition and in a traditional backpedal and will need work here as he adapts to safety in the pros.
--NAME-- is a superior run defender who played in close to the box often at South Carolina. He is efficient at shuffling and working over the top of linebackers, and then triggers a drive step to break on short passes or gets after a runner outside. He is a very firm and reliable tackler in space, which gives great added value to teams as a safety. He can blanket-cover tight ends out of press which was his specialty at South Carolina.
-------------------------
Jeff_Allen 2532787 44
--NAME-- has been a starter for four years on the offensive line for Illinois. With his size and experience playing on both the right and left sides, he will have good value as a backup at the next level. He has decent athletic ability and strength but knows how to keep defenders from beating him. He is likely worth a sixth- or seventh-round pick.
--NAME-- is not a flashy blocker and is slightly slow at times. He is a bit of a 'tweener, excelling at neither the tackle nor guard spots. Opponents might be able to exploit his comparative lack of athleticism.
--NAME-- will make it as a pro because of his versatility. He has shown that he can play four of the five positions on the line (all but center). He tends to wait for defenders to come to him in pass protection, but is able to use his hands to keep them at bay. He has decent footwork in his pass set and when in space pulling. He is also a good mirror/shield blocker. He doesn't power his way upfield very often, but his man rarely gets behind him.
-------------------------
Mark_Asper 2532788 178
--NAME-- shifted between the guard and tackle positions at Oregon as team needs dictated, playing as a guard in his senior year. All teams will love his athletic ability and experience playing in space in the Oregon spread-option attack. But he missed school for two years while on a religious mission, and potential employers will be split about his relatively advanced age (27). Some will see it as a sign of maturity, while others will fear he is already well into his prime. Regardless, --NAME-- would fit well as either a tackle or a guard on a team that utilizes a heavy zone-blocking scheme, where drive-blocking and fitting on second-level players is key. Look for him to be taken in one of the middle rounds; he should be a viable starter relatively soon.
Oregon uses a very unique zone-blocking scheme. Linemen need to be athletic but aren't required to sustain for long periods of time. --NAME-- has shown the ability to sustain, but he might have to adjust as a pro. Again, some teams might also see his age as a detriment.
--NAME-- is an athletic mover who can easily fit onto blocks on the second level. He is a versatile offensive lineman who has experience playing well in space. He understands the angles to take to get to the second level, and plays with urgency once he gets there. He is mature, able to play to his strengths to keep his man in front of him, allowing him to work his quick feet. He is an excellent wall-off blocker, which comes from working in Oregon's zone-blocking scheme.
-------------------------
Mark_Barron 2532789 7
--NAME-- was an imposing defender at Alabama. He simply looked like a professional, from the way that he prepared and warmed up to his productivity and on-field presence. A stalwart at safety, he has the size and athletic ability to contribute right away in the NFL. He has the range and ball skills to make big plays and is an active defender against the run. --NAME-- projects as a top-50 pick.
--NAME-- can be lazy with his backpedal and will hesitate in transition due to his size, but these flaws don't come up often. He occasionally launches himself into the ball carrier, a tendency that could be a liability in the NFL. --NAME-- might not be an All-Pro as a rookie, but he showed few weaknesses in college while demonstrating many traits that will serve him well at the next level.
--NAME-- reads routes and defends the run well. He has good hands and reacts quickly, allowing him to make plays on the ball, which he is often near. He is a sure tackler and uses sound foot technique to put himself in great position. He transitions well in coverage and can defend a variety of offensive players in different positions. Against the run, --NAME-- comes downfield with a head of steam; he can also fluidly run down and cover fast receivers against the pass.
-------------------------
Travis_Benjamin 2532790 100
--NAME-- was a big-play threat at Miami for several years. Initially an electric return specialist, he eventually became an effective pass-catching option. He is undersized but fast enough to get past safeties, and has the route-running savvy to outwork corners, create separation and make plays. His size might limit his pro potential, but many receivers of his stature have succeeded in the NFL. --NAME-- has third- to fourth-round value.
Because his size puts him at a disadvantage, --NAME--'s game is based entirely on speed and quickness. He has a hard time getting off the line of scrimmage if not given a free release, lacking the strength to recover if jammed by a more physical defender. --NAME-- has also historically struggled to work in traffic. He prefers to be outside on the perimeter, away from contact; this could be his Achilles heel if he were to try to move into the slot.
--NAME-- understands how to get open at the top of routes and can use his explosiveness to his advantage. As a returner, he is a "one cut and go" runner who can break for daylight. The key to his game as a receiver is his ability to get open, and he doesn't shy away from contact. He will be a true deep threat who runs crisp intermediate routes.
-------------------------
Jake_Bequette 2532791 90
--NAME-- was a strong player for Arkansas, though his productivity could be attributed more to competitiveness and intelligence than great athleticism. He stood out as a leader and high-energy player for the Razorbacks. He had the strength to rush, set the edge and hold his ground in the run game, able to battle bigger linemen and go hard until the end of the play. He is a solid tackler around the ball and consistently pursues plays from the backside. His versatility across the line makes him a good value for NFL teams, especially those running a 3-4 defense. He will likely be taken in one of the later rounds.
--NAME-- is not the greatest athlete for his size and often gets lost when double-teamed. While strong in the run game, he is seldom a factor in the passing game. He needs to improve his rush technique and hands so that he can get through blocks and into the pocket. --NAME-- rarely plays as fast as his timed speed would indicate.
--NAME-- is a strong run defender. He can set the edge well and fight off blocks. He gives it his all until the whistle blows. His size, length and running ability will be assets when tackling ball carriers in the NFL.
-------------------------
Justin_Bethel 2532792 177
--NAME-- was a four-year starter at Presbyterian College. Big for his position, he is regarded as a very heady player who can use his physicality to influence receivers from the boundary corner spot. His athleticism and run-support skills make him an interesting late-round prospect.
There are concerns about the level of competition he faced in college and how steep his learning curve will be in the NFL. He is smart but was caught flat-footed at times in man-to-man coverage. He also takes false steps off the snap and labors to get into his backpedal. He will have to improve in both areas to succeed as a pro.
--NAME-- is very effective against the pass and run. He is physical both when making tackles and working on the line of scrimmage in man-to-man coverage. His athletic ability allows him to react to the ball in man schemes, and he has the explosiveness to come downfield and make plays in zone coverage.
-------------------------
Philip_Blake 2532793 108
A native of Canada, --NAME-- didn't play football until his senior year of high school. He spent two years at Champlain Regional College in Quebec and a year at Tyler Junior College in Texas before becoming a three-year starter at Baylor. There, he led the offensive line that protected quarterback Robert Griffin III in his Heisman Trophy-winning campaign. --NAME-- has good size for his position and is continuing to improve, which should make him a solid late-round pick.
--NAME-- is still a developing talent with average athletic ability and skills. He's had difficulty against more athletic opponents in the past and will need time to become an NFL-caliber starter.
--NAME-- is large and fits well on his blocks. Once there, he can sustain and will fight to stay involved. He is quick when pulling, and will stay in front and mirror defenders in his pass set. He was a stalwart contributor to Baylor's offense up front.
-------------------------
Robert_Blanton 2532794 139
--NAME-- was a reliable, if not flashy, cornerback at Notre Dame. At this point, he could step in as a stopgap but has work to do before he can be a starter in the NFL. --NAME-- is a heady prospect who plays to his strengths. He understands footwork and technique in man-to-man coverage, but is not athletic enough to run freely with any receiver. He could be a backup as an outside corner or even in the nickel spot, and is worth a third-round pick.
--NAME-- has struggled with his backpedal and his technique at the top of routes, though he is able to recognize when he's off-line, stick his foot in the ground and redirect himself. He has a tendency to widen his feet and lose ground, which could prove costly at the next level. He also lacks the elite speed he would need to cover top-tier NFL receivers man-to-man.
--NAME-- can work in both man-to-man and zone coverage and provide support against the run. He has copious experience playing the nickel position in the slot and should be able to provide an NFL team with depth at that spot. He can recognize routes and jump on them quickly in zone coverage, and he can use his long arms to recover and make plays on the ball in man coverage. There are small inconsistencies in his technique, but he is able to use his size and length to make plays.
-------------------------
Omar_Bolden 2532796 101
--NAME-- was a productive three-year starter at left corner for Arizona State. He does have health issues, however; he sat out the last eight games of the 2009 season with an injury, then missed time last season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. If he can fully recover, the big, athletic defender has second-round value and could start immediately.
--NAME-- has played inconsistently and can get caught looking in the backfield in zone coverage. He is a solid all-around prospect, but worked exclusively outside in college, and might initially have trouble working out of the slot in sub-nickel packages.
--NAME-- is a superb cover corner capable of playing on an island. He is at his best in bump-and-run coverage but is also effective in a zone scheme, able to trigger his foot and drive to make a play on the ball. He is fast enough for the NFL and has the body control to adjust while covering at full speed.
-------------------------
Brandon_Boykin 2532798 123
--NAME--, a three-year starter, is a superior athlete who stands out even in the highly athletic SEC. He relies on speed and quick feet in coverage, and is a very flexible mover. He will have to raise his game in the NFL, but would be an intriguing prospect for a team willing to overlook his stature and wait for him to refine his technique. He can play in the nickel position immediately and should be selected in the middle of the third round.
--NAME-- is not very big, measuring in at 5-foot-9 and 181 pounds. He isn't a very strong tackler, sometimes falling off of opponents, and often has to drag players down. He can be slow to react to balls even when running side-by-side with a receiver. He will likely struggle against the NFL's bigger, more physical wideouts.
--NAME-- is the perfect athlete for the corner position. He makes hip-flipping and backpedaling look natural, and has the elasticity to mirror closely in man-to-man coverage. He is shorter than many corners, but regularly used his leaping ability and body control to intercept passes and tipped balls at Georgia. He is a burner who will be able to stay with almost any receiver in the NFL, and excels at trailing wideouts throughout their routes. He is a cover corner who can also play well up-close despite his smaller size.
-------------------------
Nigel_Bradham 2532800 105
--NAME-- is an impressive specimen for a linebacker. Physically imposing, fast and strong, he was a feared tackler in the ACC and will bring that presence to the NFL. He did occasionally struggle to see the field at Florida State and will be something of a project, but he should at least make a significant contribution on special teams.
--NAME-- can be slow to recognize plays and commit to defending the pass or run. He was athletic enough to recover from this hesitation at the collegiate level but will have a hard time if he can't react more quickly in the NFL.
--NAME-- was an extremely reliable tackler as an outside linebacker. He can jolt an offensive lineman, get outside to make plays and tackle running backs. He is quick to react to the outside run and will chase it down from inside. A solid jump-and-dive tackler, he excels when pursuing the ball in the open field, though he is also good at defending the run between the tackles. He can sink his hips and fit on running backs. Additionally, he is an effective blitzer.
-------------------------
Andre_Branch 2532801 38
--NAME-- is a tall, physical and athletic end who could move to outside linebacker for a team that runs the 3-4 defense. He should be able to regularly beat NFL linemen on the rush and disrupt the passer, whether he's standing up or has his hand on the ground. Because of his versatility and pass-rushing ability, he should come off the board late in the second round.
--NAME-- is less effective against the run than the pass. He will play high at times, and can be overpowered by two blockers, deficiencies that will likely encourage pro teams to make him a linebacker.
The big, athletic --NAME-- uses his flexibility to dip around linemen and reach the backfield. He has an uncanny knack for beating blocks and moving past linemen, and has the burst to close once he's there. He uses his hands well and sets the edge nicely against the run, but his skill at rushing the passer represents his primary value to NFL teams.
-------------------------
LaVon_Brazill 2532802 206
--NAME-- is an athletic deep threat who has been starting since his freshman year. His reliable hands and potential as a kick returner will make him a sixth-round pick.
--NAME-- struggles when running technical intermediate routes, and will drift at times when the ball is thrown. He is a poor blocker in the run game, and needs to be much more physical in that area.
--NAME-- is a savvy route-runner, quick and explosive off the line. He can sink his hips at the top of routes and vary his speed to keep defenders guessing. He has strong hands, able to focus when reaching for the ball, and is not much of a fumble risk. He is a deep threat not because of his speed but because of his ability to jump off one leg and extend for the ball.
-------------------------
Zach_Brown 2532804 52
--NAME-- might be one of the fastest straight-line linebackers to ever enter the NFL draft, making him one the most intriguing prospects of this class. He has shown sprinter-like speed on the field and should rack up tackles in the NFL. --NAME-- projects best as an outside linebacker in a 4-3 scheme, though he would likely succeed at any linebacker position. There are many questions about --NAME--'s game, including whether he can adapt to the NFL after being able to make plays with minimal effort in college. Ultimately, though, he has yet to scratch the surface of his true potential; with his size and speed, he won't be drafted any later than in the first round.
Despite his talent, there are questions surrounding other aspects of --NAME--'s game and life. He has shown a tendency to disappear for long stretches. He will also need to be reeled in, to ensure he sticks to the playbook and plays to his potential. --NAME-- could stand to put on some weight, but he is otherwise physically ready for the NFL; many of his flaws have to do with his work habits.
--NAME-- finds the ball, reacts and finishes through his tackles. His speed is, without a doubt, his strongest asset and the key to his game. A natural mover, --NAME-- excels at shedding blocks and getting to the ball. He has the footwork and hip mobility to run with any tight end in coverage. There are few running backs, even in the NFL, who can outrun --NAME--, and few will get open against him in the pass game. He does well in space and can work in the box, with his ability to sniff out runs as a gap defender and make explosive plays at the point of attack. He uses his pure athletic ability and speed to dip and run past linemen and get into the backfield. --NAME-- has the power to run through running backs, whether they're blocking or carrying the ball. He is a productive tackler and rarely falls off once he reaches the ball; he will likely continue this level of production at the NFL.
-------------------------
Ryan_Broyles 2532807 54
--NAME-- is polished and consistent. Though undersized, he knows how to get open and make the catch. He could soon be an NFL starter based on his ball skills and route-running ability alone. His feel for space on the field and knack for understanding defenses boosts his value immensely. Even though he displays premier athletic ability, he certainly doesn't make many plays due to his size. He will have to work out of the slot in the NFL, which he was able to do throughout college. Before tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in November, --NAME-- was a second-round talent.
--NAME-- is undersized. If cornerbacks get their hands on him at the line, he can struggle to break away and get into his route. He worked with a relatively basic route tree at Oklahoma, and it will be interesting to see how he adjusts to an NFL system. The injury he suffered at the end of the 2011 season may limit his already average straight-line speed, and could raise concerns about his durability.
--NAME-- is small but can get off the line of scrimmage well when given a free release, or if he has the  chance to use a jab step, and can get upfield quickly. He can make catches across the middle but is most effective in space or when covered man-to-man, showing an uncanny ability to get open. An incredible catcher, he can torque his body in any way necessary to get whatever is thrown near him. He can also occasionally run through an arm tackle. Quick and agile, he can separate from defenders and is great in short-yardage situations. Based on his consistent production in the Big 12, his overall football savvy and his athletic ability, --NAME-- should be able to smoothly and quickly transition to the NFL.
-------------------------
Josh_Chapman 2532811 136
--NAME-- was a consistent two-down nose tackle at Alabama. His stats do not stand out, but he was the bowling ball that kept the defense rolling. He can stuff lanes inside and keep linebackers free to make plays. He doesn't flash anything special, but he will be a dependable inside presence on a 3-4 defense and will likely be selected in the second round.
--NAME-- rarely makes plays on the ball. Though he will make a tackle on a run play when given the opportunity, --NAME-- often looks as if doesn't strive to do much beyond clog lanes. He has issues when rushing the passer and has trouble squeezing the pocket; his production usually comes from his strength. While he can handle double teams, it is uncommon for him to beat them. --NAME-- will also move off the line of scrimmage slowly when tired. He will need to work on his overall conditioning to have value in the NFL.
--NAME-- is an average athlete for his size, but he knows how to use his incredible strength and frame to clog lanes. He isn't going to do anything against the run or as a pass rusher, but he can make it possible for linebackers to play free and make plays on the ball. He is a secure tackler and very effective when double-teamed. He is a smart player who understands his role. His athletic ability, balance and size are what make him such an effective space-eating nose tackle.
-------------------------
Toney_Clemons 2532812 231
--NAME-- was a reliable starter after transferring from Michigan. He is a huge and athletic receiver in the mold of Anquan Boldin. He has the same body type and strong base, and can go across the middle, using his core strength to break arm tackles and get upfield. --NAME-- has some value as a returner but would be merely serviceable in that role as a pro. --NAME-- has sixth-round value based on his potential to become a solid NFL pass-catcher.
--NAME-- has had issues dropping the ball. He is confident, but struggles to catch the ball with his hands and bring it into his frame. He is a physical blocker but can be too aggressive and a liability there at times.
--NAME-- is polished as a runner, able to get into a cornerback's cushion off the line. He can break tackles after the catch and is productive at running drive routes across the field. He can catch a quick slant, break a tackle on a smaller corner, then look to run over a safety. He has the speed to be a deceptive deep threat and knows how to work underneath and sit down against zone coverage.
-------------------------
Danny_Coale 2532813 152
--NAME--, a four-year starter, is served well by his thickness and balance when working out of the slot. He is savvy and can use his explosiveness in short areas to get open in zones. He thrives on making one player miss and getting upfield. He has the skillset to succeed at the next level and stands to be a fifth-round pick. He is a mature player who can step in right away, and will be attractive to teams looking for receiver depth.
--NAME-- can struggle against bigger corners if he doesn't separate immediately off the line. He also is limited with the ball in his hands after the catch, and generally just tries to do what he can. He isn't a reliable blocker outside and struggles to sustain and stay in front of his man when working in the run game. He will be serviceable, but likely won't be very explosive at the next level.
--NAME-- understands how to be a possession receiver and work across the field to gain separation when working against man or zone coverage. He is quick with his feet, both off the line of scrimmage and in his routes, and can gain a step to get open. He also understands how to throttle his routes down when working against zone coverage. He is heady enough to make an immediate impact in the NFL. While he will be productive underneath, he has the speed to stretch the field and the physicality and fearlessness to go across the middle.
-------------------------
Audie_Cole 2532814 210
--NAME-- is a strong linebacker who has to rely on his power to overtake blockers and make plays on the ball, as he is limited athletically in space. He is best-suited for playing in close and flying to the line of scrimmage from inside the box. He has sixth-round value based on his strength.
--NAME-- was a productive tackler for North Carolina State, but most of that production came on plays that went right at him. He has difficulty turning his hips and running in space, and would be a liability in coverage at the next level.
--NAME-- is a strong player who is noticeably explosive when throwing his body into linemen. He can make good tackles when playing in the box and when the play comes to him. He is an obviously competitive player who seems to enjoy taking on linemen and fitting up with them before using his arm strength to shed. He can maul a tight end on the line but has difficulty running with them.
-------------------------
B.J._Coleman 2532815 243
--NAME-- started for three years at Tennessee-Chattanooga (though he missed four games in 2011 due to a sprained right shoulder) after transferring from Tennessee, where he was displaced as a starter in the spring of his sophomore year. He has good size and is an accurate passer who has shown that he has the qualities of an NFL starter. He has fourth-round value based on his skillset and production.
--NAME-- has struggled with his route progression and locating second receivers. He is good pocket awareness but can be rattled by pressure. He will occasionally hold on to the ball and take sacks rather than distribute to viable outlets.
--NAME-- has a quick set-up and plays with a good sense of urgency. He is athletic when scrambling and can get the ball to receivers both in short and long passing situations. He is a leader and makes good decisions. --NAME-- can really drive the ball and shows NFL-level zip on his throws.
-------------------------
Tom_Compton 2532816 193
--NAME-- started four straight seasons at tackle for South Dakota, and possesses NFL-caliber size and good athleticism. He is somewhat of an unknown coming from a smaller school, but he has shown the efficiency, smarts and athletic ability to survive at the next level. He could be selected as high as the fourth round.
--NAME-- has limited experience against top-level competition (though he has faced Minnesota and Wisconsin in recent seasons) and could face an early learning curve. He is a good run-blocker but is far from explosive; he is more of a gentle mover and sustainer than a dominating force. As a pass blocker, he punches his hands but can get slightly off balance at times.
--NAME-- is quick off the ball and can use angles to effectively get upfield on linebackers. He can position and does a good job of keeping his man in front of him. He can get around the line to the second level effortlessly when pulling, and has a technically sound pass set, which shows his perfect footwork.
-------------------------
Quinton_Coples 2532818 16
--NAME-- was on the radars of NFL scouts long before the 2012 NFL Draft. --NAME-- possesses a rare combination of size, speed, athletic ability and versatility, having played numerous roles across the defensive line. Some have questioned his consistency, but --NAME-- still has been able to produce at a high level. He has, at times, seemed to be on cruise control, teams won't be able to ignore his natural ability and the physical presence he would bring to any defense. He can play defensive end in either a 4-3 or 3-4 scheme, and should be selected early in the first round.
--NAME--' motor was the only question mark throughout his collegiate career. At times, he disappeared from the action. While he is a great interior player, --NAME-- didn't see much action outside the box and his lateral movement can be an Achilles heel for him when running down plays. There are also question marks surrounding his ability to use his hands, and his ability to ignite his feet and hips to make quick-twitch plays. He can seem as if he's moving in slow motion at times.
--NAME-- has speed, power and a massive frame, making him an uncommon prospect for the defensive line. He can trigger off the line of scrimmage, using his strong hands and overall girth to rush the passer. While he doesn't have an array of pass-rush moves, his pure power allows him to be disruptive and productive. --NAME-- plays the run very well for a tall, athletic pass-rusher, and has successfully defended the run both inside and out. His strength and body control let him stay up through double-teams and continue to make plays towards the ball. His footwork is just slightly above average for his size, but he overcomes this with a natural ability and understanding of how to leverage the point to overcome a would-be blocker. This will make him attractive to teams that run a 3-4 scheme, because they can mesh --NAME-- on the line to both rush the passer and be a stout run defender. He has undisputed first-round athletic ability for his size.
-------------------------
Kirk_Cousins 2532820 102
--NAME-- was a three-year starter, as well as a rare three-year captain, at Michigan State. He is a self-made guy, a tireless worker who has deficiencies that could hurt his pro potential. He is not a very strong deep thrower; while his velocity is adequate, his accuracy when throwing deep is questionable. Ultimately, --NAME-- is a guy who could get drafted based on his experience and intangibles, and will need to put on size and fine-tune certain throwing deficiencies to catch on at the next level. Based on the production and leadership at Michigan State, --NAME-- has late-round value to a team looking for someone to compete for a backup role.
--NAME-- is widely considered to be a game manager type at the next level. He makes good decisions with the ball but has not shown he can make the flash plays to move the offense and win games for his team at the next level. He will need talent around him to succeed, which limits his value.
--NAME-- has all the intangibles necessary for an NFL quarterback and has been a productive three-year starter. The fact that he was a three-year captain will be highly regarded by NFL general managers. He is an accurate and safe thrower who knows how to pick his spots. He is a good athlete who can make plays on the run, but is not going to run past many NFL defenders. A safe pick as a backup option.
-------------------------
Tyrone_Crawford 2532821 81
--NAME-- ended up at Boise State by way of junior college, proving himself an intriguing prospect after only one year starting at defensive end. He is originally from Canada, where he played for a year after high school and prior to attending Bakersfield College. He has a ton of upside considering his history, and possesses prototypical NFL athletic ability and speed on a perfect frame. He can play in various spots across a defensive line and could be plugged into a number of schemes. He is a bit of a late riser and has second- or third-round value as a developmental prospect with starting traits.
--NAME-- is a raw prospect with limited experience. He will be a project early on for the team that selects him, and he could have a tough time adapting right away. He has had trouble getting off double-teams, which is likely a technique issue. --NAME-- will need extra coaching and attention to adjust to the NFL.
--NAME-- is quick to get out of his stance off the snap and has the instincts to slant and hit a gap without being touched. He is consistently disrupting plays in the backfield and is a solid tackler. He is a strong player who shows an explosive arm jolt when keeping blockers at bay. --NAME-- shows good change of direction when stopping to pursue plays laterally. As a rusher, his motor is the key to his success. He never gives up on a play and can use a strong burst to get to the quarterback. He has a ton of upside, which undoubtedly increases his value to teams that are set at the position and willing to work with him. Despite his size, he could play special teams early on in his career because he has such a nasty demeanor.
-------------------------
Jared_Crick 2532822 126
--NAME-- missed the majority of his senior season because of a torn pectoral muscle, and many assumed he was the lucky beneficiary of playing next to Ndamukong Suh early in his career. However, he still could emerge as one of the premier defensive lineman in the draft. A defensive tackle at Nebraska, --NAME-- shows value not only in his ability to play inside effectively but also as a potential defensive end, particularly in a 3-4 scheme. The two-time all-conference selection has displayed enough football acumen, especially in his junior year, to still hear his name called early in the draft.
There were worries that --NAME-- would struggle against double teams after Suh left Nebraska, and those concerns proved to be true. He is tough to hold off one-on-one, but he often shuts it down or is eliminated from the play when blocked by more than one lineman. The knee injury he suffered last spring, and his overall mobility, which wasn't necessarily a strong suit prior to this season, will now be an even greater question mark.
--NAME-- possesses the size and athletic ability to play in various positions across the defensive line. He flashed the ability to defeat blocks and get to the ball-carrier in the backfield. He is active in the run game and shows great instincts. He can also run down quarterbacks with pure hustle. Off the snap, he uses his size and hands to get off blocks.
-------------------------
Juron_Criner 2532823 168
--NAME-- is a raw talent who was inconsistent throughout his career at Arizona. He was dominant in the Pac-12 at times and used his athleticism and leaping ability to simply make more plays than the man across from him. --NAME-- effectively uses his great size when going for jump balls or when "boxing out" to catch balls in the short game. He shows his athleticism after the catch, displaying an ability to make things happen early in the play, and has the burst to finish them. He needs to learn how to show up every Sunday, but his talent alone legitimizes him as a prospect. He should be one of the first five receivers taken off the board.
--NAME-- had a tendency throughout his career to disappear from games if he is not heavily involved in the action. At times, his routes can look sloppy. He is a strong blocker but the willingness can slip away from him at times. A medical concern he had before the 2011 season will also be on the minds of scouts.
--NAME-- is a lanky but athletic receiver who uses his jumping ability and large catch radius to his advantage when going up for jump balls. He runs crisp routes and is explosive off the line of scrimmage. --NAME-- gets a clean release with ease by using quickness and power, and he understands how to stem his routes to keep cornerbacks off him. He is deceptively agile for such a tall player and is a reliable option in short areas. He can use his lateral agility to make defenders miss and get up the field for yards after the catch. He is a natural who works well against zone defenses and finds his openings and quickly work upfield. --NAME-- has emerged over the past year as the go-to receiver for Arizona, and he has a confidence about his play that allows him to match up against the best.
-------------------------
B.J._Cunningham 2532824 183
--NAME-- has been a highly regarded prospect. He has size for the position and is a very polished, well-rounded receiver. He was a durable starter, making him a solid third-round value.
--NAME-- can struggle if he doesn't get open quickly with his footwork. He can be physical in routes, which at times can allow defensive backs to run in-phase with him.
--NAME-- is very savvy off the ball when getting into his route, using his core strength to swat away hands and lean on corners. He has very quick feet and can get corners off balance in-route, and can burst and then snap routes off quickly, gaining separation. He is a good zone-feel receiver who likes to sit in holes, catch the ball and work upfield. He is a strong and physical player who makes his presence felt when blocking downfield.
-------------------------
Vinny_Curry 2532825 59
--NAME-- will have good value as a pass-rushing specialist. --NAME-- is an explosive athlete who has the versatility to fit the defensive scheme of the team that selects him. He can stand up and play outside linebacker in a 3-4 scheme, where he can focus on purely rushing the quarterback each play. In the run game, he is effective and can set the edge nicely against an offensive tackle, but has a difficult time getting to the ball if he is engaged early. --NAME-- has second-round value.
--NAME-- can struggle at times and look out-of-place in the run game. He understands his role in the defense, but once engaged he has a difficult time getting in on any action, as he has trouble locating the ball. He has to show that he has the instincts to react and be involved late in the play once it is already away from him.
--NAME-- is quick off the ball when he is focused on rushing the passer, and he can set up tackles nicely by leaning them one way and dipping the opposite. He understands how to set up and work his moves throughout the duration of the game, and can get into the backfield and rush a quarterback. Once he gets a lane, he shows an amazing burst to finish the play and get to the quarterback. On run plays and against quarterbacks alike, he is reliable and explosive. He has polished technique at the position and uses his hands well to keep blockers at bay. Although he gives up size to NFL-caliber offensive linemen, he is able to hold his ground and set the edge when necessary to allow his linebackers to make plays. His natural athletic ability is evident and the key to every play that he makes.
-------------------------
Mike_Daniels 2532826 132
--NAME--, a two-year starter inside for Iowa, is an active, high-motor, high-character performer. He is undersized but uses that to his advantage to get inside of blockers. He has fourth-round talent as a rotational player, but he has the physical traits and intangibles to develop into more.
--NAME-- is undersized and gets engulfed by bigger blockers and double teams. His strength and effort will suffice, but bigger players have a clear advantage on him at times. He will have to be placed in good spots and schemes to be effective inside in the NFL.
--NAME-- is quick off the ball and uses his small frame to work between blockers. He has the instincts to understand schemes and work against them, and he is strong enough, despite his relative lack of size, to engage and then shed a blocker to burst to the play. He is flexible and an overall active interior player.
-------------------------
Andrew_Datko 2532827 241
--NAME-- played four games in 2011 because of persistent shoulder injuries but was a stalwart of the Florida State offensive line when healthy. He is a much better run blocker than pass blocker and will need to work on his pass set and overall strength to be able to block NFL-caliber defensive ends. A former walk-on, --NAME-- has the drive and competitive spirit necessary to succeed at the next level; he certainly has the size. A big man who can get overpowered at times, strength training should be a postseason necessity for him.
--NAME-- can be stiff at times and struggles noticeably with certain movements. While he is an effective blocker, it is usually not pretty. When he has to move a lot, inconsistencies in his play can show up. He does fit on blocks OK, but it is often a struggle for him to get there. He is a catcher as a blocker, but it has served him well up to this point.
--NAME-- is fast off the line of scrimmage and immediately fits on his blocks. He is not an explosive mover, but he can stay with his blocks once on them. In pass protection he can struggle at times but usually blocks long enough to get the job done. He makes up for his average athletic ability by being technically sound and understanding how to use his hands and feet to keep defenders occupied. He works hard to keep defenders moving in the run game and, despite his weaknesses, is a "get the job done" player at the end of plays and games.
-------------------------
Lavonte_David 2532828 58
--NAME-- is one of the premier linebacker prospects in this year's senior class. The Fort Scott Community College transfer is undersized but able to overcome that through his instincts and speed. He had enormous tackle production throughout his two years at Nebraska, posting more than 260 tackles in his short time there. Instincts are the key to his game, as he always seems to be in the middle of action whether rushing the passer or covering tight ends. --NAME-- will need to stay off blocks at the next level and either gain strength to shed linemen or continue to play instinctually to stay free. His athletic ability allows him to play loose and fly around, and he should go in the late first round to a team that loves undersized, athletic linebackers.
--NAME-- is undersized, and he can struggle at times when linemen get their hands on him on run plays. If he is free he hits the gap hard, but once engaged he attempts to use his strong hands to fight away. He can cover in the long term against tight ends but can also struggle in man against them at the line of scrimmage if they overpower him. Speed and savvy can often overshadow these size and strength hitches in --NAME--'s game, but his shortcomings could be exposed more at the next level.
--NAME-- has speed -- that is evident from the second the play starts. He is an instinctive player who is able to read offensive lines and trigger to get to the spot where he needs to be. He understands angles and leveraging himself when taking on blocks, which allows him to overcome his size deficiency. His footwork is fluid in transition and when moving laterally. He routinely fits up against running backs in the hole and stonewalls them at the point. He can pursue against the run to the outside and use his instincts to meet players, and he rarely whiffs on tackles. He can cover tight ends close in man coverage and works well in zone as he has natural, fluid hips to turn and pass set.
-------------------------
Alfonzo_Dennard 2532832 224
Like his classmate Jared Crick, --NAME-- played alongside premier talent (New York Giants 2011 first-round pick Prince Amukumara) early in his career and also missed some playing time as a senior due to injury (leg). But unlike Crick, --NAME-- was less tested as a senior once back from injury because he lost that elite player on the opposite side. He has some of the same traits as Prince, in that he is smart, plays with instincts and understands how to support in run defense. While he is not particularly stellar in any single trait, he has the size, athletic ability and overall above-average skills that blend together to make him a nice prospect. He is the type of corner who could contribute heavily on special teams in his rookie year. Although he has not been tested much working in the slot, he could likely be picked in the late first or early second round.
--NAME-- is a shorter corner and could potentially get out-jumped at the next level. He can let himself get blocked by more physical receivers at times, but when the play comes his way he usually gets involved. He missed the first three games of 2011 with a pulled leg muscle.
--NAME-- is a strong all-around player who doesn't shine with any particular skill. But there are few weaknesses in his game. He is a heady player who plays on top of receivers and understands how to turn and run to not get beat deep. He trusts his speed and footwork in man coverage and can fill nicely as a run defender in both run plays and in zone. He is a solid athlete who has fluid hips and can adjust to make ball plays in mid-air. He understands how to play with leverage and jam the receiver at the line of scrimmage, as he is a very balanced and strong player who rarely falls off his stance or gets pushed off coverage by bigger wideouts. --NAME-- has a lot of experience starting games at a high level and is NFL-ready.
-------------------------
Michael_Egnew 2532834 78
--NAME-- is an athletic, tall prospect similar to recent NFL successes in that he is somewhat underweight but creates mismatches up and down the field. A converted receiver, --NAME-- has struggled with traditional tight end responsibilities, such as blocking in-line and being an overall run-game presence. He is athletic for his size and presents a speed mismatch on linebackers and a size mismatch on safeties, which will ultimately define his value in this year's draft.
As a converted receiver, --NAME-- has struggled blocking defensive linemen. It is tough for him to get a free release off the line when attached to a tackle, and he is much better working off the ball. He can be physically outplayed by some bigger linebackers and could have trouble playing on the line of scrimmage at the next level.
--NAME-- is a converted receiver who understands how to run in-phase and use his athletic ability to separate. The switch to tight end was a blessing for him, considering his ability to separate from linebackers and play more physical than most safeties. He has consistent hands and a large catch radius. He is a threat after the catch and a big target for the quarterback to throw the ball anywhere near him.
-------------------------
Rhett_Ellison 2532835 128
--NAME-- is a hybrid fullback/tight end who could play either role in the NFL. He is the beneficiary of a light tight end class in 2012, projecting to be one of the first off the board. A bruiser with a punishing frame, --NAME-- is a reliable blocker, both in-line and out of the backfield. He displays the same consistency in his pass-catching skills, both out of backfield and working upfield. --NAME-- likely will be selected in the middle rounds of the draft by a team looking for a physical player who can bring a workman-like attitude to the facility.
--NAME-- is not very fast, nor is he a quick-twitch athlete. This is evident when he is running deep routes and trying to work upfield. He labors to move at times and can struggle in hard cuts on his routes.
--NAME-- is quick off the line of scrimmage for his size and understands how to stem to avoid jams. He is a decent route runner who will get covered but can separate at the top of routes. He catches nearly everything thrown to him is a very good in-line blocker.
-------------------------
Coby_Fleener 2532838 34
--NAME-- is the one senior tight end in the nation who has consistently shown the type of talent that will allow him to start early at the next level. He uses his 6-foot-6 frame well when running routes and separating from defenders. He has been the go-to target in the red zone for Andrew Luck the past few years. --NAME-- understands route concepts and has the competitiveness and size to be an effective in-line blocker. Some may question his true talent, given his size and the fact he had Luck as his quarterback, but --NAME-- is an attractive prospect who could be taken toward the end of the first round.
--NAME-- has struggled as a blocker on the line of scrimmage throughout his collegiate career, although he continues to improve. Though he is an explosive athlete with the ball or running in the open field, he is somewhat stale at the line and needs to improve his strength to become a more complete player. His lack of strength can also hold him back in the passing game, as he tends to get jammed at the line and can have trouble getting back into his route.
--NAME-- steadily improved during his time at Stanford and turned into a technical, effective route runner who is able to separate at the top of routes. He's an obvious target and has a good feel for defenders around him. --NAME-- will go up for the ball, especially in the red zone, where he had 10 touchdowns in 2011. He is a smooth athlete who looks natural running deep down the field, even at his height. He is able to anticipate the throw, find it in the air, and rarely does he not come down with it.
-------------------------
Jamell_Fleming 2532839 80
--NAME-- lined up in the boundary for Oklahoma and has a great combination of size, speed and technique that makes him a premier prospect at corner. His speed and athletic ability allow him to recover quickly off the line of scrimmage. He can get caught looking at the quarterback at times, but he usually can stay with receivers in man coverage. He is a physical and explosive athlete who can jam receivers and bring down running backs with ease. --NAME-- has played at a high level for the past four years and projects to start early at the next level as a second-round selection.
--NAME-- is not technically sound, but it hasn't hurt him up to this point. At the next level, he will need to work on his technique when using his hands and feet to jam receivers and turn at the line of scrimmage. He can be undisciplined in various aspects of his play, but it usually hurts him more in zone coverage than it does in man, where he is a natural cover corner.
--NAME-- is superb in man coverage. He is reliable on an island and showed he could stay with any receiver in the Big 12. He is not technically sound, but his backpedal and hips are naturally fluid. He can backpedal for long stretches, even by NFL standards, which allows him to stay on top of receivers and plant, drive and react to plays. He has the speed to catch up to receivers if beat and the ability to run down plays from the backside or provide help in zone. He makes the play every time as a tackler, and he can drive through his hips to deliver a blow to a ball carrier. When the ball is in the air he has the body control to turn and make a play on it. He is thick for the corner position and it is apparent that he understands his role in the run game. He is a prototypical athlete for the position.
-------------------------
Darius_Fleming 2532840 165
--NAME-- has good size for a linebacker and can bend and move well for his build. He was a starter at Notre Dame for more than two years and the key part of a very strong linebacker group. He is a good lateral mover and aggressive both in pursuit and once he gets to the ball. --NAME-- can be a liability in coverage, but he has value in a 3-4 defense as an outside linebacker who purely rushes the passer and sets the edge.
--NAME-- has little value as a dropping pass defender and often looks lost when forced to cover. He is a scheme player and would struggle if forced to cover tight ends in space in a 4-3 scheme. He also struggles when defending inside runs and is better when just setting the edge to keep the play inside.
--NAME-- is a superb rusher who has a strong burst off the line to get into a tackle, bend his knees and dip around his opponent. He excels at setting the edge and keeping plays inside of him. He is natural in his a lateral movements and can pursue plays to the outside. He has fluid hips that he relies on to recover and run down plays.
-------------------------
Michael_Floyd 2532841 13
--NAME-- has been a game changer at the collegiate level and possesses the size, aggressiveness and game experience to make a difference early in his transition to the NFL. --NAME-- has been an extremely productive deep threat, as well as a physical blocker and a reliable third-down playmaker, for the Fighting Irish throughout his career. His on-field maturity, physical nature and ability to make the big catch will outweigh some off-field mishaps, as --NAME-- projects to be one of the first receives taken in the draft.
--NAME-- does not have game-breaking speed as a deep threat, and he hasn't always been consistent. Prior injuries could raise a red flag, along with various off-field issues.
--NAME-- is a polished receiver who shows a burst off the line of scrimmage, despite his frame. He is a solid route runner who will consistently make the big catch. He is an excellent athlete who is strong and contributes in the run game with his physicality on the edge. A receiver who is tough across the middle, --NAME-- will make the difficult catch and get upfield. --NAME-- brings that Number 1 receiver presence to the next level and projects to produce to that standard. --NAME--'s frame and explosiveness off the line make him a presence that is felt by opposing defenses. As a blocker, --NAME-- will do more than just mirror defenders, as he will come down the line of scrimmage and crack linebackers. He is a red-zone threat at any level.
-------------------------
Nick_Foles 2532842 88
--NAME-- has been a productive signal-caller for Arizona through three years as a starter and has the arm strength and size that warrants first-day consideration for teams looking to fill a void at quarterback. He is a mechanically sound passer who has a solid release. In a different year, --NAME-- might have been considered the top quarterback in the class. He is a big-time leader who rarely gets rattled. --NAME--' athletic ability will be a concern to some, and some project him as a "game manager" type. But his skill set speaks for itself, so he should be at least a serviceable starter at the next level. If teams can fall in love with his arm strength, he could be selected as early as the second round to develop and become an eventual starter.
--NAME--' mobility has been his Achilles' heel and likely will be exposed even more at the next level. He is solely a pocket passer and hardly ever moves the chains with his feet. He has the ability to extend plays, but he is not going to outrun any defenders at the next level. His mechanics can slide when he improvises, although his actual passes rarely are affected. He struggles with his accuracy on deep balls. His release time is sufficient but not fast by any means. His judgment with the ball has been questioned, as he can be slow to throw and often chooses to scramble in unappealing scenarios.
--NAME-- has a strong arm that gets him through various other hitches in his game. There are times when --NAME-- throws the deep, cross-field out-route off his back foot -- while facing pressure -- accurately and with ease. Though he is not the most athletic quarterback, he avoids pressure in the pocket and has a good sense of how and when to extend a play to his advantage. As a deep passer he has strength but can struggle with accuracy at times. His accuracy is evident in his short-to-intermediate throws, where he can put it right on a receiver or give him the proper lead. He would be more valuable in a West Coast scheme that would allow him to make quick decisions and not be forced to unleash deep throws on a consistent basis. He is an excellent game manager, moving the ball in bunches up the field. He is extremely poised in the pocket and rarely lets a heavy pass rush rattle his throws.
-------------------------
Cordy_Glenn 2532849 41
--NAME-- played tackle at Georgia and was a stalwart whether lined up there or at guard. The fact that many teams will want to use him at guard and could have him on the roster for variable depth early is a big reason why he could go as early as the third round in this year's draft.
--NAME-- is somewhat of a tweener and would struggle against NFL pass rushers at tackle. He could stand to lose some weight, as he looked like he was laboring to move at times in his senior year.
--NAME-- is an athletic big man who is fluid when pulling and gets upfield with ease. He is an effective mirror blocker who shows good technique by sitting into his base and controlling defenders. He is aware of stunts and blitzes and usually picks them up with ease. He is a big body who has been a durable starter for Georgia.
-------------------------
T.J._Graham 2532850 69
--NAME-- is undersized at receiver but has started sparingly throughout his career for North Carolina State. His value lies in his peed. He is still a developing route runner and can get knocked for being a "track guy" who is unreliable across the middle. Nevertheless, his 40-yard dash time will be important throughout pro days and the combine, and he could be selected as high as the third round.
--NAME-- is a deep speed guy and that's about it. He is still developing as a route runner and won't go across the middle for balls. He is undersized and not very strong, and it shows across the middle and when he tries to block. He is willing both running across the middle and blocking, but he simply lacks the strength to be effective.
--NAME-- is a burner who can take the top off defenses at the next level. He can beat corners in man coverage and use his hands to stack on top of them and continue to gain separation. He is very good at focusing on the ball when running deep routes, and he looks natural in his catches. He is quick off the line and uses his feet well to avoid and stem corners who could overpower him. He can vary his speeds well to keep corners off-balance.
-------------------------
Cyrus_Gray 2532851 182
--NAME-- is a well-rounded back who can block, run and catch the ball out of the backfield. He has great size and has been productive as a pass catcher throughout his career. He is highly elusive in the open field and understands the nuances of short-to-intermediate routes in the passing game. He is ideal for a screen-heavy team, as he has reliable hands and is patient when waiting for plays to develop. He likes to bounce the ball outside, sometimes too quickly, but he is effective when doing so. There are knocks on his game as an inside runner, which will keep him from getting drafted as an every-down back in the NFL. He does, however, bring value as a returner. Although not explosive, he is effective in this role. Look for him to be selected in the middle rounds.
--NAME-- is not a burner and can have slow feet at times. He usually picks his spots, but he can be hesitant in the backfield. Despite his size, he struggles as a pass protector at times. It takes --NAME-- a few steps to reach full speed, and he won't be a threat to take it the distance at the next level.
--NAME-- is a big and athletic back who hits the hole hard and is elusive for a man of his size. He is one of those natural runners who understands when to weave and when to run with power. He has been highly productive and his style of running with power in his legs makes him a reliable short-yardage option early in his career.
-------------------------
Ladarius_Green 2532853 110
--NAME-- has been a late riser and could progress even more if he continues to show the type of athleticism he showed in his senior year. Although he comes from a smaller conference, --NAME-- has been a very productive pass-catching tight end and has displayed the type of athleticism that makes him a mismatch at the next level and the type of player a team could fall in love with and take with a risk-pick earlier in the draft. All things considered, he has displayed sixth-round talent up to this point and is a developmental project at the position.
--NAME-- is a raw player and would likely be a project at the position. He can struggle getting off the line of scrimmage and can give away his routes quickly when running them. He has a lot of negative aspects to his game currently but they are all skills that could be developed through time and coaching.
--NAME-- is a big tight end who understands how to get open and use his frame to be a good option for the quarterback in the short passing game. He has good foot quickness and uses this and his frame to work against zone and box out against smaller defenders to secure the easy first-down catch. --NAME-- has body control that allows him to leap, torque, and reach both high and low for poorly thrown balls, making him the type of red zone option, at his height, where an NFL QB can just throw it up to him.
-------------------------
Trevor_Guyton 2532854 219
--NAME-- has prototypical size and quickness for the defensive tackle position with the type of frame that could be attractive to teams looking for ends to play in a 3-4 defense. He was a reliable player in his senior year for Cal after not starting many games early on because of the team's depth at the position. --NAME-- is a fast player with a motor that doesn't stop, which has made him an active player in his senior year and given him sixth-round value in the draft.
--NAME-- could have value as a late-round pick given his collegiate history. He displayed a lot of traits of an early draft pick in his senior year, but his value is limited because of the short amount of time he has displayed it. Although teams understand --NAME--'s being caught behind first-round picks Cameron Jordan and Tyson Alualu, they will wonder if he's truly the player with the skills he displayed in his senior year, or just a pretender who showed up to play only once his draft status was on the line.
--NAME-- is very quick off the ball and when maneuvering in tight spaces. He uses his hands well and has good technique. He is fast to the quarterback once in the backfield and can make disruptive plays early and often. He really sets the tempo off the ball and has the ability to quickly blow back linemen. He is excellent in pursuit in the open field, where his speed really shows up. He is a sure tackler who was around the ball often in his senior year.
-------------------------
Brandon_Hardin 2532855 79
--NAME-- is a physically imposing corner who is an intriguing prospect, considering the little playing time he has received the past two years because of multiple injuries. While these injuries are a concern, if teams can look at --NAME--'s potential, he will likely be picked in the middle rounds as a developmental defensive back who could potentially move to safety.
--NAME-- has been held back significantly by injuries throughout his career. He is a bit of a slow-footed athlete, and his size makes him a tweener despite his cover skills. He hasn't played enough snaps at Oregon State to show he is NFL-ready and worthy of an early round pick.
--NAME-- is a physical cover corner who excels playing up close to the line. He has serious value for a Cover 2 team that likes big and physical corners who can support in the flats. He is a good athlete and has impressive hip fluidity for a man of his size, and he uses his length well in-phase.
-------------------------
Chandler_Harnish 2532856 253
--NAME-- could be compared in many ways to this year's NFL sensation, Tim Tebow. While not quite the bruising runner that Tebow is, --NAME-- has a similar frame and style of play. He relies more heavily on his speed than power when running, but he has been a true dual-threat at the position, posting gaudy total offense numbers each year. He has the type of running style that could be effective at the next level, but don't look for him to switch to H-back anytime soon. --NAME-- makes just enough plays with his arms to give him room to do something with his feet when the play breaks down. He has yet to prove himself as an accurate passer, and this could hurt his stock, but look for teams to select --NAME-- in the late rounds as a developmental project or change-of-pace quarterback/running threat.
--NAME-- has the arm strength, frame and mentality to be a starting quarterback at the next level, but his accuracy is so off at times that it brings his value all the way down to the late rounds. He will struggle early on adjusting to the speed and timing of NFL offenses.
--NAME-- is a powerful and effective scrambler and a better thrower on the run than he is in the pocket. He is a gamer -- he understands how to run an offense and when to pick his spots to take off running. --NAME-- is a fast and explosive athlete who uses good judgment as a passer. He has had noteworthy production despite playing in a small conference.
-------------------------
Mike_Harris 2532858 176
--NAME-- started at corner for only one year for Florida State after being a part of the Seminoles' nickel packages. He is a transfer from El Camino Community College and has great speed to excel at the position at the next level. He has a ton of experience covering in the slot and should contribute early there at the next level.
--NAME-- has good speed but can get lost at times when running with receivers and reacts to a thrown ball slightly late. He is smooth when running with his man and, at times, can run past receivers when they breaks off their routes.
--NAME-- is good in man coverage, as he has the hips and awareness to stay tight in his man's hip and run with him the whole way. He has played in the slot against athletic receivers a lot and held his own. He is a good tackler and reliable to bring his guy down and support when blitzing off the edge out of nickel packages. He is a natural athlete who won't have problems playing nickel right away.
-------------------------
Casey_Hayward 2532861 62
--NAME-- is a highly regarded corner out of Vanderbilt. Although his team has had little success throughout his career, playing in the heart of the Southeastern Conference has put --NAME-- up against top talent every week, and he has made plays consistently for the Commodores. He can run with any receiver in the SEC and has shown that he can play physically at the line of scrimmage to disrupt receivers' routes. He brings a confident mentality that he can cover anyone in single coverage given the competition he faced each week in his conference. He has third-round talent.
--NAME-- is a decent player in zone looks but not the quickest reactor. He trusts his speed too much at times, which can get him in trouble when he plays too far off the receiver. He is a smooth athlete but not very quick twitched.
--NAME-- can diagnose plays and be in position from the get-go. He will be physical when reacting to pass plays and has the speed to cover for extended periods of time in man coverage. He is a lanky player who can extend and secure interceptions when covering close. He is a reliable tackler when around the ball.
-------------------------
Junior_Hemingway 2532862 238
--NAME-- is a big and explosive receiver who started regularly for three years, catching balls from Denard Robinson at Michigan. --NAME-- is a big-framed guy who will do everything in his control to go up and make a play on the ball. He is thick and an effective run blocker, reliable in all facets of his game.
--NAME-- is a slow mover off the line and can get jammed up at times. He is a decent route runner but hasn't run many pro-style routes while working in Michigan's offense. He is not a very quick-twitched player and lacks speed variance and explosion in his routes.
--NAME-- is a talented receiver who might have been hindered throughout his career by playing with an atypical quarterback in Robinson. Playing with him, --NAME-- has developed a good field awareness and will be as ready as any rookie to make plays that happen during broken-down plays. He knows how to exploit defenses and find open holes in the zone, which he did a lot at Michigan. He is reliable when catching the ball in a crowd and is also a deep threat.
-------------------------
Dan_Herron 2532864 191
The man they call "Boom" has been a productive and powerful starting back for Ohio State. He is an extremely physical runner for his size and hits the hole hard. He has production and NFL qualities, but not quite starting potential. He started on and off for three years but was implicated in Ohio State's recent NCAA troubles and forced to sit out the first five games of his senior year. He is an effective slasher-type with third- or fourth-round value. He would need to play special teams to make a 53-man roster but has displayed the physicality to do so.
--NAME-- has decent ability to run between the tackles. He hasn't run many NFL-type routes out of the backfield in college, where he was used more as a safety outlet. --NAME-- can neutralize blitzes but can get overpowered by men simply bigger than him.
--NAME-- is quick out of his stance to get the ball and make a decision to hit the hole or get outside. He has good vision once through the hole, but he is better running outside than through the tackles. He can quickly get to top speed and will accelerate throughout the play -- he has deceptive top-end speed. He is secure with the football and a good receiving option out of the backfield. Boom is tough and will stick his face in front of rushing linebackers.
-------------------------
T.Y._Hilton 2532865 92
--NAME-- was the star of an emerging Florida International program. He has had a ton of production there despite his size, and is an athletic mover who has the speed to take the top off a defense. He is good off the line and has fourth-round value as a receiver and return specialist.
--NAME-- is undersized and it shows when he blocks in the run game. He has a tough time breaking down and getting hands on a defensive back and using strength to hold on thereafter. He is a deep threat and has production there but is not a reliable short-to-intermediate throwing option.
--NAME-- is an explosive returner who uses good judgment when fielding the ball. As a receiver he is a deep threat who can create separation when running deep due to his superior long speed. He is a decent route runner who works well out of the slot.
-------------------------
George_Iloka 2532869 167
--NAME-- has been a very productive player for Boise State and has been a factor for the Broncos since arriving in 2008. He is a superb zone defender who understands how to diagnose and react to plays. He is the quarterback of the secondary and has length to make plays and the speed to give him range in zone. He should be a backup and contribute early on, and he carries third-round value.
--NAME-- can struggle when having to mirror in man. He doesn't give up deep plays because he plays so far back, but this could also be considered a knock on him because he likely will have to align closer to the line of scrimmage in the NFL.
--NAME-- can diagnose a play and be in position in zone. He aligns very deep but has the speed to react and get involved when he needs to. He takes off once he makes a decision. He has good body control to break down and tackle or leap to make a play on the ball. He is reliable at making the interception when in front of it and comes down hard to meet running backs in run support.
-------------------------
Melvin_Ingram 2532870 18
--NAME-- is one of the most athletically gifted prospects in this year's class. He came to South Carolina as an inside linebacker and has since played in various positions across the front seven. --NAME--'s motor, athleticism and technique allow him to bring dynamic playmaking ability to an NFL defense, whether he lines up at defensive tackle or defensive end. Some believe he could be moved to outside linebacker in a 3-4 scheme to rush the passer and overpower offensive tackles. There is a chance he continues rising up boards and is selected in the first round of the draft.
The weaknesses in --NAME--'s play as a defensive tackle are all about physical limitations, such as height, weight and arm length. His short arms and size make it tough for him to eliminate double teams playing inside, and there are uncertainties about his effectiveness there at the next level. He'll also have to prove he has the first step to play defensive end and the movement skills to be moved to linebacker.
--NAME-- has an uncommon blend of speed and overall athleticism for a big man. Parlayed with a strong motor and instincts that have allowed him to line up in numerous positions across the field, --NAME-- almost always finds himself near the ball. He is quick off the snap and technically refined working the line of scrimmage, the type of lineman who can continuously defeat blocks to play the run or pass and make plays.
-------------------------
Bruce_Irvin 2532871 15
--NAME-- is a compelling prospect whose athletic ability is as unique as his path to the NFL. An electrifying pass rusher who will fit as either a specialist defensive end or an outside linebacker in a 3-4 scheme, --NAME-- uses a flurry of moves to get to the quarterback. His uncanny ability to maneuver his undersized frame around and through offensive linemen helped him tally a number of sacks at West Virginia. A player who is hampered by his size and amount of snaps taken at a high level, --NAME-- should be selected within the first two rounds of the draft by a team looking for a boost in its ability to get to the quarterback.
Although he was effective as a run defender in his senior year, for the better part of --NAME--'s career he struggled to stay on the field on non-passing downs. He is inexperienced as a three-down defender, and it remains to be seen if he can be a reliable option defending the run. He also surprisingly struggles when given the task of covering tight ends one-on-one, and up to this point has been widely considered a pass rush only option for the West Virginia defense.
--NAME-- has an array of moves that he uses when working the outside on an offensive tackle. He can use an explosive plant and drive that allows him to get under the chin of a tackle and disengage quickly to gain separation, or simply use his short-area burst to dip and run around a blocker. He is a stellar outside-run defender and rarely lets plays get outside of him even though he struggles to hold an edge at the point of attack. His athletic ability is what allows him to be a read-and-react player in the run game yet still be effective. He can keep his balance even when shocked by much bigger linemen and is a reliable tackler when he gets to the ball. --NAME-- would be an ideal option at outside linebacker in a 3-4 defense, where he can focus solely on rushing the passer.
-------------------------
Asa_Jackson 2532872 169
--NAME-- is a four-year starter from Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo. While there are a limited amount of prospects out of SLO in the past few years, --NAME-- projects to be the best. He has strong footwork and understands how to cover in man. The level of his collegiate competition could hurt him, but his speed and athletic ability give him a great shot to compete at the next level, and his potential could make him a mid-round pick or even higher.
--NAME-- will be knocked for playing at a small school, but he has shown the ability to cover NFL talent within the conference over the years. He can struggle at times in his backpedal and will likely not be an option to play right away at the next level.
While he has a history of getting beat from time to time, --NAME-- has been a productive corner for years. He is effective in the run game and has the instincts to make plays on the ball in both the run and pass. He isn't the most physical corner, but he displays great range to recover when getting beat and almost always shows up around the ball.
-------------------------
Malik_Jackson 2532873 137
--NAME-- came to UT after leaving USC and has blossomed in the SEC, becoming a two-year starter for the Volunteers. Although undersized for the defensive tackle position, --NAME-- has gotten upward of 270 pounds and been an effective scheme player when slanting and stunting for Tennessee. He will likely switch back to DE in the NFL, but 3-4 base defense teams could be excited about him playing DE considering his time spent inside. He has seventh-round value as a versatile D-lineman.
--NAME-- can get washed out at times by stronger offensive linemen. Strength has been his consistent Achilles heel and it's a wonder that he survived after being moved inside after transferring. He is better suited to playing end and even then could struggle to get off blocks against Pro Bowl-caliber offensive linemen.
--NAME-- is quick off the ball, and more effective when given space to not have to face bigger linemen, usually through a schematic call that allows him to run free through a gap. Although undersized, he is able to hold up bigger linemen and then shed those players to get to the ball. He had good rush production inside even though he was often physically overmatched, and once in the backfield he is a fluid mover toward the ball.
-------------------------
Janoris_Jenkins 2532875 39
--NAME-- was a three-year starter at Florida before transferring to North Alabama after multiple run-ins with the law and the Gators' coaching staff. While there are some character concerns, --NAME-- is a natural cover corner who has strong instincts and athletic ability to cover top wideouts. Size is also a concern for --NAME--, but he has shown the ability to match up with big-time SEC talent. He looks comfortable with the ball in his hands as a returner and projects to contribute there as well. If teams can overlook his off-field transgressions, --NAME-- has the natural abilities to be a first-round talent and could be selected in the first 20 picks.
Aside from off-field concerns, --NAME-- projects as an undersized corner. He could have trouble adapting to the size and physicality of some top NFL receivers, as his ability to tackle and provide support against the run has been a question mark up to this point and will remain so at the next level.
--NAME-- is an explosive player who can stay with receivers and cover in man and zone. His ability to read plays and react allows him to be around the ball, where he uses his athletic ability, quickness, and closing speed to finish plays. --NAME-- has impressive hips, and his fluidity stands out and makes him a natural at the position. A flexible athlete, he is quick-twitched and can ignite a powerful plant foot at any time or position to react on a ball or move by a receiver. Despite his size, --NAME-- can jam and re-route receivers at the line and play with physicality in run support. He is a classic man-cover corner who uses his superior athletic ability and instincts to stay a step ahead.
-------------------------
A.J._Jenkins 2532876 30
--NAME-- was a two-year starter at Illinois (while also starting four games over his first two years) for the now-departed Ron Zook and has the speed to take the top off NFL defenses. He separates well when running with defenders and is good in securing the catch. He has fifth-round value at the next level.
--NAME-- initiates a hard step in, then back out, as his go-to move to release off the line, and corners can see it coming at times and get their hands in his chest to throw him off. He is a smooth runner, but he will take plays off.
--NAME-- is quick off the ball and gets to top speed quickly. If he gets a free release, he can be tough for corners to stay with initially. He has ability to separate when necessary and is very fluid throughout his routes. His body is strikingly under control throughout, and he has good balance if corners try to push into his hips. --NAME-- is willing to go across the middle and always reaches out to pluck the ball. He is effective deep but is less of a threat after the catch.
-------------------------
Trumaine_Johnson 2532877 65
--NAME-- is arguably one of the most polished NFL prospects to come out of the Big Sky Conference in quite some time. He is a big, athletic cover corner who has completely dominated his competition. He has the speed and agility to stay with receivers and also the height to match up in the red zone. Despite playing in the Football Championship Subdivision, --NAME-- is an NFL-ready corner who is projected for the second round.
--NAME-- could be knocked for not having experience covering receivers in top-notch conferences like other corners at the top of the draft board. There will undoubtedly be a learning curve for him at the next level. Although he is a good tackler against the run, he can get caught on blocks at times and needs to learn to shed more quickly.
--NAME-- is a lanky defender who has the athletic ability to stay in a receiver's hip and make plays. He uses his arms effectively in press coverage and jabs receivers to interrupt their routes and timing within the offense. He understands when to react in zone and possesses the long speed to take risks there and still recover. He is good at reading the receiver's hips, reacting to their drop and quickly making a play on the ball. He is a very effective tackler and imposing athlete at the position.
-------------------------
James-Michael_Johnson 2532880 120
--NAME-- has played both outside and inside during his four years at Nevada. He has been a productive tackler and is an obvious leader and inspiration on the defense. He is athletic and thick, and he brings power to the line of scrimmage when tackling. He has fourth-round talent and has the temperament to contribute on special teams early.
--NAME-- is always around the play but has a tough time making plays on the ball in passing downs. He can cover in man but is better in zone and could get outrun by tight ends in the NFL. He is not very fast and is better served playing inside the box.
--NAME-- is thick, and it shows when he tackles. He is a form tackler and sure to bring runners down. He is strong and can shed blocks with ease, and he filled the gap quickly in Nevada's defense. He is instinctive and highly active on the field, and is smooth in his pass set. He reacts well to both run and pass and should develop into a starter.
-------------------------
Marcel_Jones 2532881 234
--NAME-- is one of the top offensive tackles in the class after starting for two years on some highly productive Nebraska offensive lines. He has the size and footwork to compete for a job at left tackle at the next level, and such prospects often have second- or third-round value. --NAME-- is no different, and he has the talent to start early in his NFL career. Look for him to make a move to the right side, though, as he is less reliable powering off his right foot and isn't quite at the level to start immediately protecting on the left side.
--NAME-- can struggle at times in space, as he is a big man and can take a few steps to get going. He is reliable at sustaining blocks once there but can struggle to throttle down and set on linebackers.
--NAME-- is a polished run blocker from his time spent in the Nebraska offense, but he is an accomplished pass protector as well. He has size to block any defensive end in the NFL and a pass set and anchor to stop a bull rush. He is athletic enough to recover against pro defensive ends and would be a physically imposing player on any offensive line. He likely will need to begin his NFL career on the right side as he develops the flexibility and reliability to be a blindside blocker.
-------------------------
Ben_Jones 2532883 99
--NAME-- has started at center since arriving at Georgia. He is a leader on the field who made all the calls up front for the Bulldogs. He is a savvy player who doesn't have great athletic ability but understands angles when blocking and plays to his strengths. He is a reliable backup option early on and worthy of a sixth-round pick.
--NAME-- has trouble with his footwork in many aspects of the game. He is savvy enough to overcome it, but is exposed when he is in open space attempting to pull, where his feet can get very choppy. He is a very non-explosive blocker who relies on his ability to mirror and his overall strength.
--NAME-- is very good at staying with his blocks and sealing off defenders in the run game. He has trouble moving defenders backward but is efficient in how he mirrors and can seal at the last second to create a hole. He is similar when pass blocking -- he understands his strengths and sets early to stall bull rushers.
-------------------------
Marvin_Jones 2532884 166
--NAME-- has been a good possession-type receiver for the past three years. He does not possess great speed but seems to have a good understanding of how to play to his strengths and get open. --NAME-- played with a quarterback last year who was always looking to throw on the run, and --NAME-- has been a good option for him working to get open downfield.
--NAME-- can find holes in coverage and use a lean to separate when running routes, but when he is covered closely at his hip by DBs, he has a tough time separating with his acceleration or speed. He is more of a smooth runner who won't blow by many NFL corners, and although he is a deep threat from his jumping ability and ability to adjust to and catch the ball, he doesn't use speed to win in anything that he does.
--NAME-- is big off the line and knows how to explode into a corner's face to get him to turn his hips early and keep him off balance. --NAME-- is not a very smooth in-route runner and tends to drift away from the ball, but he is effective in stemming his routes off the line and understanding how to lean on DBs to get open at the top of routes. --NAME-- has incredible hands and can extend to snatch balls that are thrown high over his head, and has the flexibility in his hips to go down and snag balls thrown at his ankles.
-------------------------
Josh_Kaddu 2532886 155
--NAME-- has been a steady presence for Oregon's defense as a starter the past two seasons. He is a good player in space and is able to run down ball carriers, but can get overpowered at the point of attack. He is athletic in coverage and in his pass drop, and is a fly-around player who is heavily involved each game. He has late-round talent as a special teams contributor and backup linebacker.
--NAME-- is not a very instinctive player and has to rely on his athletic ability to bail out of plays where he otherwise seems lost. He has value on teams considering his physical nature and running ability, but will have a tough time adjusting to an NFL defense and being able to diagnose plays in offenses run by the likes of Peyton Manning or Tom Brady.
--NAME-- is an athlete at the position. He has fluid hips and an explosive twitch from his stance which allows him to make plays quickly; he is lucky considering that he is often slow to diagnose plays and this is his recovery tool. He is a fly-around player in pursuit and a classic sideline-to-sideline linebacker who needs to be in the right 4-3 defensive scheme to be successful. He is reliable to cover tight ends downfield.
-------------------------
Senio_Kelemete 2532889 151
--NAME-- has been a steady presence for Washington for four years who has shown versatility across not only the offensive but the defensive line throughout his career. He started at defensive tackle in 2008, then switched to offensive guard for the 2009 season before starting the past two at left tackle. He is an athlete for such a big body. Teams will debate whether to leave him outside or move him in to guard, and he could project better there as he is a bit short for the tackle position. Look for him to be taken in the fifth round to a team in need of line depth.
--NAME-- still has technique issues with his pass set when working from the tackle position. He has shown a tendency to set his base a bit slowly and get off balance and beat to the outside. This could be yet another reason to move him inside.
--NAME-- is an athlete, especially for a lineman who could potentially be playing on the interior. He comes off the ball fast and consistently puts himself in good positions for blocks. He is able to stay with his blocks for the duration of running plays and is good to use his feet to maneuver himself in the right position when pulling and sealing. Working up to the second level, --NAME-- gets in good position to get his big body in front of linebackers. He uses his hands well.
-------------------------
Mychal_Kendricks 2532890 46
--NAME-- has been a highly productive middle linebacker with a physical presence for the Golden Bears. He has had high tackle production and has been durable in his role. He will bring a physical presence to any defense and grades out as one of the top inside linebacker prospects in the draft, with second-round value. He is physical and capable of playing in a 3-4 scheme if necessary.
He is a very solid tackler who punishes running backs when he fills the gap on inside runs.
-------------------------
Josh_LeRibeus 2532891 71
Leribeus returned for his senior campaign after being academically ineligible as a junior, and was the same scrappy, reliable inside blocker that he has been throughout his career. He has the size and technique inside to play early at the next level or be a reliable backup, which gives him fifth-round value as a guard or potential center.
Leribeus is a bit slow and struggles athletically. This could be a problem at the next level, as he isn't a very strong or explosive blocker. He would be better served to work within a zone blocking scheme where he isn't expected to fully move defenders.
Leribeus is a very good scheme and overall run blocker in SMU's offense. He is quick off the ball with his first step and almost always gets his hands on blocks early. He is an active player who will fight to sustain his blocks downfield. He shows good effort and motor to stay with the play and is just as effective when working in space as a puller. Some small issues with his footwork and athletic ability show up when he tries to work to the second level, but overall he almost always finds a way to block his man.
-------------------------
Travis_Lewis 2532892 223
--NAME-- was a four-year starter for the Sooners and the quarterback of their defense. He plays in one of the few true 3-4 schemes in college and has value in that he can do so at the next level. He is a strong tackler, a potential special teams contributor and has fourth-round value.
--NAME-- can diagnose plays late at times, and can struggle when runners are coming directly at him. He tackles well in pursuit from the side but can't set his butt to uncoil his hips and deliver a blow at a runner coming directly at him. He has a good pass set but can't run well with tight ends in man across the field.
--NAME-- is an athlete and is quick twitched off the snap. He can shed blocks and often has to considering the scheme he plays in, where offensive lines are up to the second level often. He is great in pursuit of outside runs and has the speed to get there. He displays a nice, athletic pass drop where he can flip his hips and set to react to balls and men coming across the middle. An aware, athletic linebacker with high tackle production.
-------------------------
Ryan_Lindley 2532894 185
--NAME-- is an athletic signal caller who has first-round talent when assessing simply his arm strength. The strongest senior thrower in this year's draft, --NAME-- can make crossfield deep out throws with ease. He is athletic in his pass set and does a good job surveying the field. His problems have surrounded his judgment at times: He can rely too heavily on his gunslinger mentality and get into trouble with interceptions and poorly placed balls. On his size and arm strength alone, --NAME-- should be selected in the late third round.
--NAME-- has been inaccurate at times and will take some time to develop. He will throw an NFL pass one play, then make a bad decision that puts his team in trouble. He is athletic but can be a slow mover and take sacks from holding the ball too long. Most of his issues stem from his inconsistency in intermediate and deep routes.
--NAME-- has a very lively arm and can drive the ball from anywhere on the field off his back foot. When he is having a good game, --NAME-- can thread the needle and put the ball on a receiver in stride 65 yards down the field. He is athletic in his pass set and can extend plays and fend off would-be rushers. --NAME-- is a developmental talent who has value to teams willing to be patient with him.
-------------------------
Joe_Looney 2532896 117
--NAME-- is a strong interior lineman who has been consistent for the Demon Deacons since stepping on campus. He is an athletic mover who blocks well in the run game and has great size. He has fourth-round value based on his production and ability to be inserted right away.
--NAME-- can struggle in his pass set at times. He has the feet to get there but will get aggressive and lose his balance on blockers. He can work to sit in his base better and be more effective here at the next level, but needs a good coach.
--NAME-- is quick off the ball to get into D-linemen and get movement. He displays good technique in his sets and is very polished when using his hands. He can get upfield to hit linebackers and is effective when pulling or sealing the edge. He has been a reliable and durable interior guy at Wake Forest, and the go-to man to run behind throughout his career.
-------------------------
Brandon_Marshall 2532898 142
--NAME-- has started every game over the past three years. He isn't real tall, but is lanky and has a large "tackle radius" in which he can make plays on guys by diving from yards away. He led Nevada in tackles in his junior and senior years. There are some issues with his athletic ability as it translates to the next level, but --NAME-- is a sixth-round talent.
--NAME-- is a bit short for the position and has a tough time making plays on the ball once in his pass set. He does have good athletic ability, but he looks lost at times playing zone. He is better within the box, where he doesn't have to use his instincts against the pass.
--NAME-- is an instinctual player who can diagnose plays quickly and be a quick reactor. He is good at working over tight ends and using his long arms to get in their chest area and disrupt their routes. He also uses his arms well to shed would-be blockers when working laterally, and he has speed to run down plays to the outside.
-------------------------
Doug_Martin 2532899 31
--NAME-- had 1,299 yards and 16 TDs in Boise State's electric offense in 2011. He has strong athletic ability, with outstanding footwork. He can make people miss in the open field and in tight spaces. He is an effective runner between the tackles and can burst through the lane. What stands out most about --NAME-- is his decisiveness as a ball carrier; he often hits the hole hard. He is a natural with the ball in his hands and will bring value to an NFL team as a special teams player. Though ball security has been a concern in the past, --NAME-- is an overall solid back and should expect to be selected in the second round.
--NAME-- is a very traditional back who is not extremely explosive. He is good in all facets, but some scouts will knock him for not being "outstanding" in any one particular area.
--NAME-- is a highly productive back with a polished all-around game. He looks and plays like a starting NFL back. He has a lot of experience and has been reliable closing out games for Boise State. He is careful with the ball and a very savvy runner between the tackles with the athletic ability to break it outside.
-------------------------
Keshawn_Martin 2532900 121
--NAME-- is an explosive mover who is quick off the snap. A two-year starter for Michigan State and productive after short catches, he can take a bubble screen the distance. Athletic enough to be the superior guy against most DBs. He is a very good speed-variance route runner who can keep corners on their heels and toes. He has fourth-round value.
--NAME-- is uninspired when it comes to blocking. Despite decent size, he isn't very strong and just looks completely uninvolved. The same can be said when going across the middle; he is unreliable with defenders draped around him and needs to be completely open to finish the play.
--NAME-- is good at varying his speed. He can make ridiculous moves with his feet while still running full speed. He is explosive when moving off the ball and gets to top speed very quickly. This is usually how he dials up his routes, as he is into them before the corner is even ready. He uses this same foot quickness to get open at the top of routes. He has the speed to be a deep threat at the next level. He will work a lot of screens looking to get behind blocks of bigger receivers outside.
-------------------------
Mike_Martin 2532901 82
--NAME-- has started the past three years inside for Michigan after making a nice impact as a true freshman. He is a tough and durable player who relies on his strength to control blockers and make plays. His strength is what defines him.
--NAME-- can struggle in space and is a stout player at the point, but he really doesn't have much production rushing the passer. Once in the backfield, he has a tough time running down the quarterback, and his athletic ability can be exposed in space.
--NAME-- has a good feel for offensive lines and block schemes and how to slant inside of lineman to get into the backfield. He is very strong against the run and can neutralize any blocker. He can hold up a block, and then shed to get to the ball. He plays with instincts and is strong.
-------------------------
Markelle_Martin 2532902 190
--NAME-- is a fast safety who has the ability to run down receivers from all over the field. He can be exposed at times due to his average athletic ability, but has value due to his speed and all-around skills. He is a smooth athlete who has difficulty covering more quick-twitch players. He understands how to support in run but does not display the physicality to be an imposing defender on the back end. --NAME-- has late-round value based on his speed and productivity.
--NAME-- is a smooth, nonexplosive player who plays more not to get beat than to get involved heavily in the action. He is limited when he plays one-on-one. He is around the ball often, but rarely does he step in front of the ball for a big turnover.
--NAME-- brings speed to any defense. He can get the defensive backfield lined up and reacts to plays well. He has the ability to recover when there is a busted coverage, and he has the skills to make a play on the ball once he gets there. --NAME-- is able to get ball carriers down in run support, and understands how to play zone. He is a fluid athlete who can run with receivers when tested deep, but is better when running toward the play and not having to flip his hips.
-------------------------
Rishard_Matthews 2532903 227
--NAME-- has been a reliable receiver for Nevada the past two years after graduating from Bakersfield College. He is a player who uses his size and savvy to be productive. He has added value as a returner, although he has been rather non-explosive in that role. The main concern is that his athletic ability does not bode well for an easy transition to the NFL.
--NAME-- is a slow mover who labors in space. He does not display quickness off the line and struggles to get his feet moving. He can get jammed and off-routed because of this, and it will be difficult for him to overcome at the next level.
--NAME-- is a very strong receiver in traffic and is reliable to make the contested catch and get upfield with the ball. He has a good feel within his routes for defenders. He is not that athletic but has good balance and is able to break arm tackles.
-------------------------
Matt_McCants 2532905 201
--NAME-- is a late-round value pick as a developmental project at the tackle position. He has the natural size and frame for the next level, but will need to put on some weight to hold his own against bigger NFL defensive ends. He is an on/off type player who will show NFL starter traits one minute, and barely UAB starting traits the next.
--NAME-- is not a very strong athlete and played the majority of his career under 290 pounds. He will need to put on a good deal of size and strength to block and compete at the next level. He struggles when coming out of a three-point stance and has displayed some very telling and troubling tendencies throughout college which could scare NFL teams.
--NAME-- is a very good positional blocker with fluid hips. He has the body control to get up in a defensive lineman's face, and if he falls off, can recover and continue to shuffle and mirror to keep position. This serves him better in pass protection, where he hardly ever allows a sack in his conference. --NAME-- is athletic when moving in space and plays much better when pulling or sealing than when playing in a phone booth.
-------------------------
Shea_McClellin 2532907 19
--NAME-- has started three consecutive years at defensive end for Boise State. He is an undersized DE who 3-4 teams will value at the OLB position. At just under 260 pounds, he can struggle at times against bigger linemen, but he has fifth-round value.
--NAME-- will have a tough time convincing teams, even though he has been productive, to take a shot on him early in the draft because of his size. He has displayed enough athletic ability for teams to consider him at outside backer, but he could stand to lose weight as he enters the next level.
--NAME-- is a strong player inside for the Broncos who uses good leverage to get under heavier offensive linemen and jolt them back in their stance. He is aggressive, stout, and can hold off linemen and smother tight ends at the point of attack. He has no problem tackling and is a good pass rusher.
-------------------------
Jerron_McMillian 2532908 133
One of the top prospects to emerge from Maine in years, --NAME-- is a strong and physical safety who at times can look stiff covering the pass. His value lies in his ability to support the run and be a sure tackler, and he has sixth-round value based on this.
--NAME-- can struggle in some of his transitional movements when playing the pass. He looks to support the run first and this can get him to bite at times.
--NAME-- brings a physical presence to the back end of the defense, reacts to passes well and can force his body hard in one direction to make a play toward the ball, much like he does in his reactions to the run. He is quick to diagnose run and pass, and reacts to the run much better coming toward the line of scrimmage than he does moving away. --NAME-- is NFL-ready in supporting the run.
-------------------------
Marvin_McNutt 2532909 194
--NAME-- was a starter for the better part of the last three years at Iowa and a physical presence on the outside. He is a strong player who catches the ball well and can run through arm tackles once he gets the ball. --NAME-- has the size to excel at the next level. He plays a bit hesitant at times when blocking in run support and running through traffic.
--NAME-- can struggle when running routes across the middle. There are consistency and effort issues when blocking and running decoy routes that aren't intended to him, and he can struggle off the line if he isn't decisive and powerful with his first step.
--NAME-- is reliable to get his hands on the ball and make a tough catch when it's thrown anywhere near him. He has good awareness to get open on broken plays and drag his feet along the sidelines. He is a viable possession-type option for quarterbacks looking to pick up a quick first down.
-------------------------
DeQuan_Menzie 2532911 146
--NAME-- has some hitches in his athletic ability that will make for a tough transition to the NFL. He is consistently around the ball, however, and making splash plays for the decorated Crimson Tide defense. He is the type of player whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts in terms of the type of player he will be on Sundays. He is a playmaker and savvy cover man who has second-round value.
--NAME-- is a solid all-around prospect who has fluid hips and athletic ability, which he relies on too heavily at times. He takes chances in man coverage that could hurt him at the next level.
--NAME-- is a very instinctual corner who relies on his ability to anticipate the throw and break on the ball to disrupt passes. He is a strong player when working in tight space and can use his agility and foot quickness to stay on a receiver's hip. He is a strong player in zone and understands when to take chances and jump routes. He scans the entire field and helps when needed in these schemes. He never shies away from contact and is a productive tackler working from the outside-in.
-------------------------
Ryan_Miller 2532912 160
There will be discussions about moving --NAME-- outside to tackle from guard: This debate revolves around --NAME--'s size, much like last year's first round-pick at OT, Nate Solder. Given --NAME--'s solid athletic ability and size, a move to the outside seems imminent. --NAME-- would need to learn the position after spending the past two years inside, but he could transition well with his talent and versatility. --NAME-- could go as early as the late first round, but most likely will settle in nicely in the second round.
Some will consider --NAME-- a tweener and wonder if there is a hidden aspect to his ability that made him play inside despite prototypical tackle size. He is a bit of a slow mover and will take some time to develop if moved outside to tackle.
--NAME-- did everything well on the front line for Colorado as he is able to come off the ball quickly and bend well despite his immense height. In the parts of three years he spent at tackle, he sustained on his blocks well and often finishes through the play.
-------------------------
David_Molk 2532914 226
--NAME-- won the 2011 Rimington Trophy as the nation's top center after starting four years at Michigan. He has good speed for his position and is a strong player. He is slightly underweight, but it hasn't affected his play much up to this point. He can be late to pick up blitzes at times and struggles in his technique, but he has solid value and should be selected near the fifth round.
--NAME-- can have trouble sustaining his blocks through the end of run plays. He often has to pull his man down with him to keep him out of the play and finds it difficult to generate enough push early to create a solid hole for his backs. He is reliable to not allow sacks in pass production but can get off balance when setting against bull rushes.
--NAME-- is quick off the line of scrimmage and gains an advantage on his man immediately. He is also quick to get out when pulling and can gather speed rather quickly to bury any linebacker in his sight. He displays good footwork in nearly all of his movements and has a good pass set.
-------------------------
Brandon_Mosley 2532918 131
--NAME-- played defensive end and tight end at Coffeyville Community College. He converted to the offensive tackle position after signing with Auburn. He continues to develop both physically and with his skill set, and has some traits that make him a late-round prospect.
--NAME-- is a clear developmental prospect for two reasons: he hasn't played the position long, and he played in a spread offense which is far from conventional for an NFL tackle. He will have a serious developmental phase.
--NAME-- is good at mirroring the defender and keeping his man in front of him. He is not a violent blocker but can move people enough to create a hole. He has played in a spread offense where he was responsible for walling defenders off and getting to the second level, which he excels at.
-------------------------
Josh_Norman 2532920 143
--NAME-- is a solid prospect from small-school Coastal Carolina. He has great size for the cornerback position and parlays this with an ability to move fluidly and match up with big, athletic wide receivers. He reminds some of a young Ike Taylor, a tall and athletic big corner from a smaller school. --NAME-- does not quite possess the blazing speed that Taylor did when coming into the NFL, however. Look for --NAME-- to be selected in the fourth round.
--NAME-- has not faced top competition, and will need to contribute on special teams to stick, which he hasn't done much in college. He is taller and can struggle with some hip/transitional movements moving to his left, but it's not a major concern.
--NAME-- can play man and zone equally well and was a physical presence on the outside. He understands when to take risks and when to play back, and he is physical when he makes his decision to come up. He supports the run well and is a reliable tackler.
-------------------------
Brad_Nortman 2532921 207
--NAME-- has been a steady, reliable punter for Wisconsin, employing a strong leg and consistency. He can routinely boot it more than 45 yards and has potential to be drafted in the late rounds by a team with a need at the position.
--NAME-- has a tendency to let the ball get away from him every now and then and shank one off to his left, but this hasn't been a consistent problem and he was reliable in his senior year.
--NAME-- has an athletic, lively leg and can really drive the ball. He is capable of many different kicks, and is accurate in placing the ball inside the 20-yard line. He is very capable of punting on Sundays.
-------------------------
Kelechi_Osemele 2532922 60
--NAME-- will need strong coaching, but could to be a dominant lineman based off his production at Iowa State. He has great athletic ability and gets off the line very quickly. He understands blocking with angles and within a scheme, and has the upper strength to keep on his blocks once he gets to them. Very rarely do defenders release themselves from his blocks, and if he can learn to get to the block sooner at the NFL level, he can be a stalwart for years to come. His potential as a go-to run blocker for the next decade could find him selected as early as the first round.
--NAME-- is somewhat raw and can disappear for stretches. He is highly effective once engaged, but has had trouble sticking onto blocks in the first place against more athletic players. He has to take better angles at the second level. He is not a pure tackle and may have more value at guard, which may make some teams wonder if he is worth the time and early-round investment as a project when they have an immediate need to fill.
--NAME-- is an extremely strong, natural run blocker. He is explosive off the line and can visibly jolt defenders back. Once engaged, he can ignite a powerful leg drive to keep defenders at bay. If --NAME-- can learn to play with consistency and channel his explosiveness, he could be an overwhelming blocker who is dominant at the next level.
-------------------------
David_Paulson 2532924 240
--NAME-- has been a reliable pass-catching tight end for Oregon. He struggles to get open, but he makes plays when the ball is thrown. He has been a consistent and durable starter who has always been capable of keeping the chains moving within the offense. He can make the spectacular catch and has sixth-round talent.
--NAME-- will find it difficult to get open at the next level going up against more athletic linebackers. He is a slow mover who struggles to change direction quickly, which could be dangerous as it will allow linebackers and safeties to recover or undercut his routes.
--NAME-- is athletic, although he doesn't look the part. He is quick to get into his route and understands to how to play to his strengths. He knows how to lean on linebackers or throw a last-second jab at them to get space. He is decent as a blocker to wall off his defender, something he was asked to do a lot in Oregon's offense.
-------------------------
Isaiah_Pead 2532926 50
--NAME-- is an electrifying running back who has produced in all areas. He can catch the ball out of the backfield, make a guy miss and turn upfield for a score, or run inside the tackles. He uses his vision and athletic ability to find a hole. There are few question marks about --NAME--'s skill set; some may worry about his play transferring to the next level, as he has shown the tendency to disappear at time. --NAME-- should be one of the first three backs taken in the draft, with second-round value.
--NAME-- isn't a willing blocker and barely displays the strength to stall rushers when he does step in. He has limited experience catching passes out of the backfield, and there are questions as to his consistency. He is a bit undersized and hasn't been hit enough times in college to get a feeling of what his durability will be at the next level.
--NAME-- has an initial step comparable to some of the best NFL backs. He hits the hole explosively, which allows him to get upfield and find a seam. He has good vision once he gets through the hole, and displays the lateral agility to make the first defender miss. He can dance around defenders but prefers to cut once and go. His burst, footwork and vision allow him to be a viable pass-catching option out of the backfield.
-------------------------
DeVier_Posey 2532930 68
--NAME-- is a savvy route runner who has overcome various obstacles at Ohio State. He is athletic and understands how to get open. He can be counted on to secure the catch when not draped by a defender. --NAME-- showed in his short opportunity during his senior year why he has third-round value.
--NAME-- will get caught peeking at incoming safeties when going across the middle. He shows toughness when blocking, but not here. He sometimes will seem uninvolved in the physical aspect of the game.
--NAME-- can struggle off the line but understands, for the most part, how to stem his routes to set up a defender and then use his suddenness to change directions. He can burst and stick his foot in the ground at the top of routes to gain separation. He is effective after the catch and is very polished.
-------------------------
Nate_Potter 2532931 221
--NAME-- is a reliable and athletic lineman for Boise state who started every game the past two years at left tackle protecting Kellen Moore. He takes good angles to the second level and is a very heady player who knows how to get to his blocks and has the strength to stick on them. He is a bit underweight for tackle at under 300 pounds and has fifth-round talent.
--NAME-- is a non-explosive player who gets movement from his leg drive and not from initial contact. He hasn't shown much pulling at Boise State, and there are some questions as to how his game will translate right away at the next level.
--NAME-- is quick off the ball to get into his blocks and sustain in the run game. He has the strength and balance to stick with it and get movement. He is a very technical blocker who employs a good pass set and quick feet to get in position. He has versatile value as a guard.
-------------------------
Brian_Quick 2532933 33
--NAME-- has very uncommon size for the position and surprises scouts with his ability to run. The fact that he is a former basketball player and high jumper shows in his play. Despite his short time playing football, he understands how to run routes and get open. Look for --NAME-- to be the highest pick from Appalachian State in years and be taken in the second round.
Inexperience is his Achilles heel. He hasn't shown the ability to run by big-time corners at his level. He sometimes has trouble adjusting to poorly thrown balls. Being tested early in camp will give the greatest indication of --NAME--'s ability to handle the jump in talent.
--NAME--'s size is his greatest asset. His time playing football has been limited, and professional coaching could help mold --NAME-- into a game changer at the next level. He is a reliable hands catcher who has the radius and grip strength to bring down any ball thrown near his area. He is a great option in the short game, as he understands how to use his frame to shield out smaller defenders.
-------------------------
Chris_Rainey 2532934 159
--NAME--, like his teammate Jeff Demps, is a burner. Unlike Demps, his track-speed translates to the football field, which makes him an intriguing prospect who has played various roles in Florida's offense. While not nearly as big as former teammate Percy Harvin, --NAME-- has been able to deliver for the Gators in a similar fashion. He uses his agility and quickness to make guys miss. He could move up into the middle rounds.
--NAME-- is undersized and it shows when he tries to run inside or pass protect. He almost always looks to get outside and will go down on contact when running in the box. He is not willing nor able to block linebackers and protect the quarterback and will get overpowered at the next level. He is a strict work-in-space player at the next level and will have a hard time playing as a traditional running back.
--NAME-- is quick and decisive off the snap. He usually looks to get the edge. He is a very effective short-area mover who can ignite a two-step power move to beat a defender laterally and get to the edge. He is a straight-line runner but is elusive and make defenders miss in the open field. He is a good route runner out of the backfield and out of the slot and he will likely get work there early in the pros.
-------------------------
Kheeston_Randall 2532935 215
--NAME-- is a strong force up front, in the mold of many former Longhorns who aren't completely athletic but effective with bull rushing and manhandling linemen. --NAME-- plays in spots for Texas and is hardly ever on the field in passing situations. He played the nose position in many 3-4 type alignments but is undersized for the pros. He has sixth-round value.
--NAME-- is a non-factor on passing downs. Not only is he usually pulled out of the game for obvious passing situations, but he is ineffective when he does get his chance.
--NAME-- is an instinctual player who always seems to pick and choose his spots correctly when slanting and stunting. He seems to be crafty and able to avoid double teams to be a major factor against the run. He can hold up blocks well at the point, then shed quickly. --NAME-- uses his hands well here and also as a pass rusher.
-------------------------
Kendall_Reyes 2532937 49
--NAME-- is a big body inside with a decent skill set. He's a good option for a team that needs defensive line depth. --NAME-- is a powerful mover and a hard worker who should stick at the next level based on size and strength.
--NAME-- is a good all-around prospect, but doesn't display any jaw-dropping skills that make him attractive at the next level. He plays a bit underweight, and this can show up at times when going against double teams. --NAME-- will have a tough time getting into the backfield to disrupt or rush the passer at the next level.
--NAME-- has a big frame and he uses it well. He has a strong lower body which provides him a good anchor when going up against double teams. He is savvy with his hands to keep offensive lineman off him. --NAME-- has a motor inside and relies more on his feet and technique to beat guys. --NAME-- will be a reliable player at the next level who consistently displays high effort and rarely gets completely blocked inside.
-------------------------
Trent_Robinson 2532939 180
--NAME-- has been a reliable three-year starter for Michigan State who really came on strong in his senior year. He was the leader for a highly athletic and productive defensive backfield. He is a solid all-around player who has good change of direction to cover players deep and can also come up physically to make plays in run support. He has fourth- or fifth-round value.
--NAME-- can misread plays at times and although physical, will fall off tackles occasionally. If working in the box, bigger linemen can get their hands on him and engulf. He has had a history of injuries at Michigan State and will need to show durability.
--NAME-- can cover well and mirrors tight ends well in-phase. He trusts his footwork and makes good plays once diagnosing them. He has good hips to turn and run with wideouts and the speed to stay with them. He has the body control to turn when running with a wideout and make an athletic play on the ball. --NAME-- is good in run support. He is aggressive in all phases.
-------------------------
Keenan_Robinson 2532940 119
--NAME-- was a three-year starter at inside linebacker for Texas and is an athletic mover who can run down faster players. He is a solid all-around prospect who may be better suited to play outside linebacker, where he can play more freely and get pursuit production from the inside out. He is a fourth- or fifth-round prospect who could contribute on special teams.
--NAME-- can get lazy at times because his speed allows him to play effortlessly. He struggles when rushing the passer and looks stunned when an offensive lineman gets his hands on him. Once blocked, he usually stays that way. He needs to come forward and deliver the blow first himself.
--NAME-- works well in space to position himself to make a play and is a quick mover off the snap. He is at his best when working toward the outside of offensive tackles and getting through to the backfield to run down ball carriers. He has the natural speed to play casually and run down players in space, and can pass set and cover tight ends with ease.
-------------------------
Zebrie_Sanders 2532943 144
--NAME-- is a quick athlete for his size, though he could stand to put on more weight. He excels in the pass game, where he uses his size and does not allow defenders to get by him. He is a smart player who rarely gets out of position and projects to be a reliable option for teams at the next level, with the potential to creep into the first round.
While --NAME-- is a smooth athlete, he does not necessarily display the strength and explosiveness that is evident of most first-round-type linemen. He will not wow anyone with his ability to knock a defender off the line.
--NAME-- is an athletic big man. While he holds his own in the run game, he is a great pass blocker who knows how to use his hands and size to stay productive. He has good feet and is very smooth in his movements and pass sets. He has good agility and can get his body on defenders upfield in the run and screen game.
-------------------------
Mitchell_Schwartz 2532945 37
--NAME-- is a versatile player who does many things well but doesn't stand out in any one area, and that's likely the rep that will stay with him through the draft. --NAME-- is a guy who makes it off effort and smarts. He has decent size for a tackle, and doesn't display strong skills that would encourage a move inside to guard. His size and productivity at Cal will earn him consideration in the fifth or sixth round.
--NAME--'s average athletic ability is the greatest knock on him. He is a bit stiff in his movements and out of his stance, and can struggle when working to the second level. He may need to move inside because of the liability he could be outside at tackle.
He can get overpowered in the run game, but --NAME-- plays with good technique. He is effective in his pass set and can sit back and let bigger players run into them yet still be effective by walling them off. He is a heady player who takes good angles to blocks and rarely falls off them.
-------------------------
Coty_Sensabaugh 2532946 115
--NAME-- has seen his value rise in the past season since becoming a starter for Clemson. He is the cousin of Cowboys starting safety Gerald --NAME--. He displayed good athletic ability and has value as a sixth-round pick.
--NAME-- has not started many games, and some scouts see him benefiting from his cousin's rise with the Cowboys. He is an athletic mover but will need to develop his technique at the next level.
--NAME-- is an athletic corner who was a late boomer. He displayed the ability to cover top prospects in his senior year and is savvy around the ball. He is smooth when transitioning and can flip his hips well. --NAME-- is better at man than zone, and he has shown the tackling ability to contribute on special teams.
-------------------------
Amini_Silatolu 2532947 40
--NAME-- is a large, athletic interior lineman who has the ability to smother his opponents and consistently sustain his blocks through the end of plays. Coming from a small school like Midwestern State and facing little competition, he will have an adjustment period far greater than other linemen as he enters the league. A team likely will want to move him from his college position of tackle to guard, where he can use his athletic ability to get up field more often in the run game. --NAME--'s greatest attribute is his footwork, as he is quick off the line of scrimmage and an active puller who can get outside, move upfield and locate his blocks to quickly engage. He does not have great leverage or explosiveness in his play but possesses many strong assets for an interior lineman, giving him early second-round value to a team with the patience to develop him into a starter.
--NAME-- is not an explosive blocker, and his limited time working at guard will likely slow his development as he transitions to the next level. Midwestern State does not face the level of competition or athletic type of player that he will line up against in training camp, and teams should expect he may need to develop somewhat before he can be inserted as a starter. He can be overaggressive at times and whiff on blocks; he needs to play disciplined at the next level.
--NAME-- is a quick athlete for a man of his stature and gets off the line with a noticeable quickness. He is urgent in his play, and once engaged with a defender can keep him covered up for an extended period of time. He is a leg-driver who doesn't get a lot of movement but keeps his man occupied. He is extremely mobile and an active puller who can get outside, move upfield and locate his blocks. He can slide well in pass protection and will likely be a guard who can sit and stop rushers in their tracks in the pass game at the next level. He is a shield blocker who rarely lets a man behind him.
-------------------------
Harrison_Smith 2532948 29
--NAME-- is an ultra-athletic, big and smart safety who has roamed the secondary as a four-year starter and senior captain for Notre Dame. He is the type of safety who is always involved, using his quickness, recognition and overall body control to react effectively to plays. While he has just adequate speed, he makes up for this deficiency with strong play recognition and anticipation, and he is often in a position to make a play on the ball. Overall, --NAME-- is a smart, athletic defender who should push to start early in a zone-heavy NFL scheme. Expect him to contend for a late first-round selection with the help of impressive postseason workouts and interviews.
--NAME-- can struggle when covering man to man. He often finds himself in a poor position when the ball is thrown. Short area movements are of a concern somewhat, so he will be much better in a read-and-react zone defense in which he can rely on instincts and recognition more than athletic ability. While he shows up as a solid athlete in every other aspect of his game, his technique in man coverage will expose some inconsistencies in his footwork, as he often relies too heavily on his recover ability and overall length to make plays on the ball. Though he is a somewhat fluid athlete, he can be beaten by quick-twitch and explosive movers.
--NAME-- is an athletic, smart free safety.  He is strong and has great size for the position, and he shows up in the run game as effectively as he does against the pass. He stands out as a lengthy athlete who has range to match NFL speed across the defensive backfield. He is extremely reliable and effective in run support, which comes from his ability to read and react to plays on a quick twitch off the snap. --NAME-- was very productive in college and rarely misses. He is a drag-down tackler who is always around the ball. Although he may have to catch and rarely delivers a blow, he is consistent. As a pass-defender, he is able to read the ball in the air and make plays all across the back end of the defense. He is able to read the quarterback well in zone and uses his athletic ability to turn and run to make plays on the ball. He is a long-strider as a runner and can turn and ignite a quick burst to run down a receiver downfield. He can then utilize his length to make strong plays on the ball. If he is in position, he will make the big interception.
-------------------------
Michael_Smith 2532949 212
--NAME-- is one of those "anomaly" prospects who has extremely uncommon speed yet doesn't start for his own team in a less-than superior conference, the Western Athletic Conference. If paired with an electric younger starter at running back, --NAME-- could see his value rise significantly in the coming months as a player who isn't picked in the middle rounds due to athletic ability and special circumstances that have kept him in the shadows up to this point. He will help himself immensely with strong showings at his pro day, and could be selected in the middle or late rounds.
--NAME-- has been hurt by the fact that there was a more talented player who started ahead of him at Utah State. Despite his athletic ability it would be tough to spend a pick on him in the early rounds since he hasn't had a lot of carries at a smaller school.
--NAME-- is very explosive out of the backfield and can get to top speed quickly. He can overpower defenders simply by running fast at his weight. --NAME--'s 40-yard dash time will be the key to his value, but he is a good change-of-pace option early on at the NFL level.
-------------------------
Scott_Solomon 2532951 211
--NAME-- is the type of player NFL teams would love to have roaming among their front seven, not necessarily for his natural ability, but because of the obvious competitive spirit he brings to a defense. He has been a four-year starter for Rice -- after a medical redshirt year, he came back from a foot injury with a slight hitch, but displayed the same motor that made him a prospect in the first place. He has fifth- or sixth-round value based on his productivity and hopes that he continues to recover from a lingering foot issue.
--NAME-- can be completely neutralized by double teams. His motor doesn't translate well when he needs it to overcome stronger opponents -- despite his effort, he can just get overpowered. He has struggled with lingering effects of a foot injury that caused him to miss an entire season, which doesn't help considering he wasn't the best athlete before the injury.
--NAME--'s entire game revolves around his motor. He is quick off the ball and will jolt back offensive linemen who are slow movers. He can run by linemen who aren't set and ready for the various stunts that he has run at Rice. He projects to be an excellent rotational player at the next level because of his motor and understanding of how to play off rushers and work within slanting and stunting schemes. He is at his best when having to chase or run down plays, and he has shown a good use of hands throughout his career to keep bigger blockers off him.
-------------------------
Sean_Spence 2532952 86
--NAME-- has been a bright spot and a standout player on a rather uninspired Miami defense. He was a four-year starter at Miami, and although undersized he makes up for this deficiency through speed, instincts and overall athletic ability. He is a great defender on outside runs, as he can effortlessly run down his fastest opponents. He is stellar in coverage, and he can blanket tight ends and tackle from various angles. He makes quick decisions and executes on them. While size will be a concern as he enters the NFL, --NAME-- will be defined by his ability to play free and get off blocks to make plays on the ball. While he was suspended in the fallout from the Nevin Shapiro booster scandal at Miami, there is little doubt of his true character and, likewise, his overall athleticism and ability. Look for him to be taken in the middle rounds, but he could be a late riser.
--NAME-- is undersized and needs to play free of big blockers on him to be productive. He can flow to plays but "rides the pole" and falls off tackles at times. The scheme he plays in is key to his production.
--NAME--'s athleticism shows in all that he does. He can quickly diagnose a play and use his explosive hips to meet running backs and deliver the blow. He has fluid hips in coverage and uses his arm strength to shed blockers when he gets engulfed by bigger players. He is an experienced starter at a high level, and this should allow him to play fast and instinctively from the start at the next level. He has natural athletic ability to fit in a 4-3 scheme, in which he can play freely and flow to the ball. He is an active player and almost always involved on run plays.
-------------------------
Devon_Still 2532954 53
--NAME-- is one of the most NFL-ready interior lineman of this year's senior class and arguably one of the most polished and "safe" picks of the draft. He has massive size to clog lanes on the inside and occupy blocks. --NAME-- displays good technique to beat double teams and get to the passer, and the power to bowl over would-be blockers to be disruptive in the backfield. He has been a reliable and productive player throughout his time at Penn State. A team that needs to address its run defense and add a player who will occupy and keep linebackers free in a 4-3 or 3-4 scheme likely will select --NAME-- in the middle of the first round as an immediate starter.
While --NAME-- can rush the passer, it is rare that he actually gets there to record the sack, as his athletic ability is rather average once he is in the open field. He works tremendously in tight quarters but doesn't display that quickness or explosion when free. This is true of his play in pursuit, as well. Once the ball gets past him, he usually is done for the play.
--NAME-- is a strong player who gets off the line quickly for his size and shows the explosion to blow back offensive guards into their own backfield. He excels as a run defender by using his strength to occupy a blocker while he reads the play and reacts, which is ideal for a nose tackle in a 3-4 defense. He has the ability to use hand technique and footwork to remove himself from blocks and get in the backfield. For a massive nose tackle, he is an above-average pass rusher who can use an array of swim and dip moves to get to the passer.
-------------------------
Alameda_Ta'amu 2532955 109
--NAME-- was a big-boned, powerful inside force for Washington who projects to play the nose tackle position in a 3-4 defense at the next level. He has the ability to hold up linemen and clog lanes to keep linebackers clean, which boosts his value. He has been so effective with the Huskies that there have been some arguably "less-talented" players at Washington who have been extremely productive because of his presence inside on the line.
--NAME-- is a slow-mover who struggles to rush the passer and chase down ball carriers. He lacks pass-rush moves and doesn't use his feet or hands to get off blocks. He has little value in a 4-3 defense given his shortcomings.
--NAME-- is a forceful player against the run who can quickly get off the ball and into a lineman's face. He can hold two blockers to create lanes for his linebackers. He is big-bodied and understands his role within the defense. He can engulf running backs by using his long, strong arms or by pushing the interior of an offensive line into the backfield.
-------------------------
Ryan_Tannehill 2532956 8
--NAME-- is a dynamic athlete at quarterback, which could stem from his two-plus years at receiver with the Aggies before becoming their starting signal-caller. In his early starts at quarterback, --NAME-- was more of a gunslinger than a refined thrower, but he now has morphed into an efficient pocket passer. --NAME-- is a also fierce competitor with the overall tools to be a first-round selection and eventual starter in the NFL.
--NAME-- has only displayed for one year that he has the arm and decision-making at quarterback to start in the NFL. He did a lot to dispel concerns in his senior year, but he will need to continue to develop and likely won't be a starting option as a rookie.
When dropping, --NAME-- is calm and makes it obvious that he is a natural athlete at the position. He has a good feel for pressure and has turned his scrambling ability into a big asset, as he has developed a great feel for extending the play. He is mechanically sound and can anticipate where the receiver will be, and displays fairly consistent accuracy throughout all routes. He is a consummate running threat.
-------------------------
Brandon_Taylor 2532958 73
--NAME-- is a hardworking safety who was a physical presence for a highly touted LSU defense the past three years. There are some small hitches in his play that limit his draft value, but starting at LSU for three years is a testament to his NFL potential. He is a physical safety who likely will be selected late based off his experience at a high level.
--NAME-- struggles when covering in man, and in three years rarely has been put in a position where he has to do so. With the type of corners and athletic linebackers LSU has trotted onto the field during his tenure, --NAME-- has been able to play in the box to support the run and has little work in covering receivers.
--NAME-- is a physical safety who enjoys getting in the mix to support the run. He is an effective box player who puts himself in good positions when being the eighth man. He is highly productive and effective as a tackler, and he likes to throw his body around at receivers and let his presence be known. He can be dragged by some bigger players at times, but he rarely falls of a tackle.
-------------------------
Brandon_Thompson 2532959 93
--NAME-- brings value to the NFL in that he can play both defensive tackle or nose tackle at the next level. With his size and athletic ability, --NAME-- has been a disruptive force for Clemson. He plays stout against the run and will plug the hole well for an NFL team. He is able to find the ball as a defender and is effective after the snap in making plays in the backfield. He doesn't bring a ton of pass-rush ability, but he will be able to serve as a strong presence up front. He has the talent to warrant a late first or early second-round pick.
--NAME-- tends to be negated by double teams inside. His substandard technique can limit him at times and contributes to his inability to get past those doubles. Though he is stellar against the run, he is limited against the pass, only occasionally making things happen as a rusher.
--NAME-- is an incredible run defender inside. He is consistent in his play and uses his feet to make plays against the run. He comes off the ball quickly and is able to fill gaps well at his size. He also makes plays on the ball carrier. He is a very strong player who knows how to use his hands and disrupt plays in the backfield.
-------------------------
Nick_Toon 2532960 122
Size is the name of --NAME--'s game. The son of former New York Jets star Al --NAME--, --NAME-- stands at 6-foot-2, 215 pounds, and plays to that size. --NAME-- might not run past many NFL defensive backs, but his overall awareness at the position, understanding of how to play to his strengths and effectiveness in the run game make him a solid prospect. He should be an NFL mainstay after being selected somewhere in the second round.
--NAME-- is not the fastest receiver prospect, and it can show when he attempts to stretch the field. He has a tough time separating at his size and explosion. Ankle mobility is a small concern, as he occasionally labors at the top of routes.
--NAME-- understands how to run strong routes, using his size to make a play on the ball and move the chains. Not only is he an excellent mid-range receiver, he also has shown the ability to gain position on defenders downfield and make deep ball plays. He is willing and definitely strong enough to be involved as a blocker in the run game. He is a red-zone threat at the next level and a go-to receiver on intermediate routes to pick up the first down.
-------------------------
Danny_Trevathan 2532961 188
--NAME-- is a fluid athlete who is undersized but crafty and uses his athletic ability to stay active. In the right NFL system that can keep offensive linemen off him, likely a 4-3 scheme, --NAME-- can hit a lane hard and make plays in the backfield. He struggles to get free once blockers engage him, which will be a persistent problem. Due to his athletic ability and enormous production, he has fourth-round value and could be selected even earlier by a team looking to take a risk on an undersized guy capable of contributing immediately on special teams.
--NAME-- is an undersized linebacker who can struggle to shed away from bigger offensive linemen. He should thrive in coverage given his size, but he struggles there as well and seems to get lost. He is better in tight areas and gets somewhat exposed when playing zone coverage. He also can be slow to diagnose plays at times; he needs to hit plays full speed to be effective. He can overrun plays even though he is effective in pursuit.
--NAME-- is a good lateral mover who makes plays sideline to sideline. He can run down almost any ball carrier. He relies on his speed to rush the passer and brings a physical, explosive drive-shoulder tackle when he reaches the quarterback. He can secure interceptions with relative ease and is active in the pass game even though he struggles when dropping. He is a classic undersized, athletic lateral mover at outside linebacker.
-------------------------
Courtney_Upshaw 2532964 35
--NAME-- is a naturally strong player who will be an imposing rush outside linebacker in a 3-4 alignment. His athletic ability can be exposed in the open field because he doesn't have great agility or speed, but his understanding of how to use his strength and leverage, as well as his hands, allows him to blanket tight ends at the line of scrimmage and avoid having to run with them across the field. He has overpowered many tackles and running backs through the years. He is at his best against inside runs, and he struggles when having to chase outside. He will also need to develop his footwork and show that he has speed to be an effective pass rusher at the next level. With his size, strength and ability to stop the run, --NAME-- has late first-round talent. Look for him to be drafted by a team with a pass-rush specialist opposite of him at outside backer in a 3-4 scheme where he can set the edge, work against tight ends and be a heavy run defender.
--NAME-- is a strong man who has serious lower body power, and at times this can limit his fluid movements. He labors when moving laterally and has slower feet than most productive pass rushers. He is a bull-rusher first and a finesse player second. He can struggle at times pursuing a play across the field. He is much more effective in tight quarters than in space, and there are questions as to whether his athletic ability will be exposed at the next level.
--NAME-- sets the edge as good as any prospect in recent years. He uses his lower body strength to stall blockers and read plays off them to get to the ball in the run game. He understands how to use his hands to stack a block, hold the player in place, shed him and react to the play. He also uses his hands well when covering a tight end at the line of scrimmage. Physical strength, explosion and the ability to overpower offensive linemen to get to the ball carrier are --NAME--'s best traits. --NAME-- uses brute strength to rush the passer, can leverage tackles at the point of attack and force them into the backfield to create disruption. He also possesses the flexibility and knee bend to dip around tackles when given a step.
-------------------------
Trevin_Wade 2532965 245
--NAME-- had an interesting collegiate career, with plenty of ups and downs in the past three years. Initially touted as a top corner prospect after a stellar sophomore season in which he blanketed future pros, --NAME-- had a down junior year and lost some of his luster. He showed many flashes again as a senior that have propelled him back into the discussion of the draft's top cornerback prospects. --NAME-- is a productive cover corner who has the size, footwork and skills to make an impact as a potential starter at the next level. He could be taken as early as the second round.
--NAME-- has consistency issues after an entire junior year of getting beat up and down the field and looking uninspired in his play. Teams will bank on getting the player who had a strong sophomore campaign and decent senior year, but he can't afford to take plays off or perform the way he did in his junior year, when he was an entirely different and undraftable player.
--NAME-- possesses many key traits that cover corners need to succeed at the next level, including height, hip mobility, fluidity in his backpedal and an understanding of how to play the line of scrimmage to disrupt route timing.
-------------------------
Bobby_Wagner 2532966 47
--NAME-- is an impressive prospect who is a prototypical NFL middle linebacker in terms of size, tackling ability and instincts. He called all the plays for Utah State's defense. He's had more than 100 tackles each of the past two years. He is a stellar pre-snap defender and properly lines up his teammates. He recognizes the play and diagnoses where to run once the ball is snapped. He is a bit short for the position at just over 6-foot-0, but he is thick and brings power when he meets a running back in the hole. He projects to be a starter at the next level and be selected late in the second round of the draft.
--NAME-- is undersized to play middle linebacker in the NFL. This hasn't affected him much thus far in his career, as he plays much stronger than he looks, but at the next level he could get overpowered by larger linemen. He hasn't had much production rushing the passer from his spot but posts a good amount of tackles for loss and is in the backfield often.
--NAME-- can sniff out a play and read the offensive line, which allows him to hit the gap and meet a running back in the hole. He can hit, push back and disengage from linemen. He can deliver a blow to linemen and then get off the block and find the ball. He is stronger than he appears and can toss bigger linemen aside to get to disrupt a play. He has speed to run down the play outside but can be outrun at times by fast running backs. He has a motor that doesn't stop.
-------------------------
Rokevious_Watkins 2532969 150
--NAME-- played offensive guard for two years before switching to both right and left tackle as a senior. He is huge and can work well in the run game to get a push. He is a big-bodied project at the next level and projects to be a late-round pick for a team needing lineman depth.
--NAME-- can labor at times to get upfield and does not work well in space. His footwork in his pass set suggests that he may be better off moving inside to guard, where he has worked before. He may need to shed some weight to move more competitively at the next level.
--NAME-- is a massive blocker who displays athletic ability in his movements and can get upfield when pulling or working toward a linebacker. He is not an explosive player who will blow back a defensive lineman, but once engaged he gets the job done. He uses a strong base to stay on his feet and finish blocks. He has not shown much leg drive to drive defenders back in the run game, but he has been adequate in both the run game and pass protection.
-------------------------
Brandon_Weeden 2532970 22
--NAME-- joined the Cowboys after a stint playing minor league baseball. --NAME-- has been the signal-caller for one of the country's most efficient and explosive offenses. He is a poised, effective thrower who has great pocket presence and makes quick decisions with the ball to keep the chains moving. He rarely throws interceptions despite the high number of attempts in his scheme. He could be picked as high as the second round.
Despite his baseball background, --NAME-- is only an average athlete and is very limited when scrambling. He has a tough time getting outside the pocket, and his accuracy and touch decrease immensely when he scrambles. He seems to grasp route concepts and looks for his second option, but he will hold the ball for extended periods of times and could be a product of his quick-read offensive scheme.
--NAME-- has an NFL-quality frame that allows him to look over the offensive line and deliver his throws without a hitch. His quick release is his strongest asset, as he consistently fires the ball with a compact throwing motion and strong delivery. The ball zips off his arm, and he has the ability to fit it in any tight space. He is "all of the above" in terms of being a mature, poised leader. He is an accurate passer on throws short and long, and he has that gunslinger mentality to go for the deep ball when it's an option. He understands route progressions and throwing the ball to allow his receiver to make a play.
-------------------------
Jordan_White 2532971 244
--NAME-- is a big and powerful receiver who is an NFL-ready route runner. He plays with instincts and has good explosion for his size. He could work from the outside or from the slot, as he knows how to get open from anywhere on the field. He is the type of prospect that could play immediately and will have little trouble adapting at the next level even though he played in a smaller conference.
--NAME-- played in a smaller conference, but his route-running ability and natural athleticism will dispel any concerns there. He can be too "by the book" at times in his route running, and smart veteran corners could be able to read his hips and pick up on his routes. He will need to work on disguising his routes by using certain head fakes and learning to make every route look the same off the snap.
--NAME-- understands how to run NFL routes. He is physical and can subtly throw defenders off him at the top of routes to get open. He is somewhat mechanical in his routes but knows how to sink his hips and gain separation. He is a reliable catcher who thrives when going across the middle and securing the catch. He also can torque his body and make the tough catch.
-------------------------
Corey_White 2532972 162
--NAME-- is an up-and-coming prospect out of Samford who has great size for a cornerback and could be moved back to safety at the next level given his skill set. He has been a consistent tackler and run defender. He could benefit from playing at the back of a defense and working toward the line of scrimmage to be more involved in run support than he would be from his corner position. He could struggle with the athletic demands of the cornerback position. Look for him to be taken in the late rounds as a project and special teams contributor.
--NAME-- is not a great athlete for the corner position. He is a bit of an awkward runner and can struggle in transition. He stutters his feet through movements and in and out of breaks, which makes it difficult for him to cover closely in man-to-man schemes. He is a bit late in reacting to plays because of his slow footwork, and the same is true of his reactions when working in zone.
--NAME-- is very strong in run support, where he takes great angles toward the ball. He uses his feet to track runners and fit on them to make plays. He approaches ball carriers like a safety would, which bodes well for a position switch. --NAME-- displays good athletic ability when near a receiver with the ball is in the air, but he can struggle getting to that point. All these skills combine to make him a stronger and more intriguing safety than corner, especially given his size.
-------------------------
Kyle_Wilber 2532974 113
--NAME-- is a big, athletic and strong outside linebacker from Wake Forest who looks the part of a pro defender. He arrived at Wake Forest as a top recruit from Florida, bringing his impressive size and speed to the defense. He is a bit of a poor man's Aaron Curry, whom he played with early in his career. He is a high-energy, high-motor player who hasn't played much on special teams at Wake Forest because of the team's needs, but he could easily contribute there at the next level. Look for a team needing linebacker depth and special teams contributions to select him in the late rounds and potentially develop him into a starter.
--NAME-- is atheltic, but he struggles in space against the run. He has a bit of an awkward pass drop, and his flexibility is an issue in those exposures. --NAME-- also is a much better player against outside runs than inside, and he has a tough time using his hands to disengage from blockers.
--NAME-- is fast and can move quickly once he deciphers a play. He is very quick-twitched and efficient in his movements. He uses his footwork and agility to stay off blocks on the second level. He doesn't have a ton of strength, but he hits his gaps hard and can pack a punch at the line of scrimmage when he meets running backs. He is better against the run than he is against the pass, but he can play over the tight end well enough to disrupt him early. He has good technique both in his footwork and tackling form.
-------------------------
Russell_Wilson 2532975 75
--NAME-- is this year's big-time question mark at quarterback. Unlike those who have held this title in the past, --NAME-- is a stellar passer who shows arm strength and accuracy when he is able to deliver the ball without a hitch. The North Carolina State transfer has outstanding football intelligence, as he picked up the Wisconsin offense in a short time and was the opening-day starter. But teams will have concerns whether --NAME-- can see over the pocket to make the throws at the next level. He is a mechanical mover who has strong technique and leadership qualities. If --NAME-- were three inches taller, there would be debate at the top of the draft as to where he fits. But look for teams to take a flier on him in a late round to see if he can develop and outplay his size.
--NAME--'s height will be his biggest inhibitor at the next level and the largest reason for his late-round value. It remains to be seen if he can throw effectively from the pocket at the next level.
--NAME-- is an accurate passer. He is a very mechanical quarterback who not only is consistent in his drop step, but also understands how to move within the pocket and evade when the pocket collapses. He is an athlete and can torque his body to make any sort of throw on the run, and is accurate in this setting. He is a born signal-caller who shows command of the offense. He has the arm strength to make the deep throws and the touch to put it on a receiver in stride. He is effective when scrambling and extending plays.
-------------------------
Billy_Winn 2532976 205
--NAME-- has been a force up front for Boise State for several years. His consistency and ferociousness stays in your memory after watching him play. Although he isn't necessarily great with any one skill or talent, he grades out well because the whole is definitely greater than the sum of his parts. There are hitches in his play that he will need to work on to survive at the next level, such as using technique and adapting to the play speed, but once done --NAME-- should excel. Expect him to be taken near the top of the second round by a team that knows it will be receiving a high-effort, high-energy player to roam along its front four.
--NAME-- has been a productive player who shows speed and very few negative points in terms of skill set while playing within the Western Athletic Conference. If anything, teams could take a long look at his competition to see if his skills will translate, but he has excelled against stronger non-conference competition as well. --NAME-- can struggle to get off blocks at times when engaged by a double team. He tries to overcome this by using his initial quickness off the line, but when bigger linemen get their hands on him in protection he can be slow to disengage.  He is known to take a play off occasionally and can be unpredictable when it comes to following schemes.
--NAME-- has size for the position, which when paired with his speed makes him a force in the interior for offensive lines. He gets off the ball and into offensive linemen quickly. He can uncoil his hips to create a significant push and shock blockers back into the backfield. He is strong with his hands and can hold up blocks to read a play and shed them to get free and get to the ball carrier. He uses his hands well to disengage and shed would-be blockers away from his frame. Once he reaches the ball carrier, he is an effective tackler. --NAME-- is an active interior defender who can keep off blocks and stay active in the pass and run defense alike.
-------------------------
Kendall_Wright 2532977 20
--NAME-- had been a solid complimentary player in Baylor's high-octane offense who has turned into much more in his senior year. As Robert Griffin III's go-to option at receiver, --NAME-- working himself wide open for a long touchdown seemed to be a common sight for Big 12 opponents this season. --NAME-- is undersized but has the speed to take the top off of NFL defenses. His athletic ability is his greatest strength, and he uses strong, polished technique to make up for his size deficiencies on the field. He has the wiggle and subsequent burst to make a move on a defender and get upfield. His ball skills are on par with his overall skills as a wideout, and he uses his footwork to run strong routes. He will have to improve his blocking and overall strength at the next level, but --NAME-- has the potential to be a first-day pick and make an instant impact.
--NAME-- hasn't shown the ability to block or be a factor in the run game while at Baylor. If the ball is not coming his way, he can be seen loafing. He's the type of receiver who needs to be involved in the game to be a factor at all. Showing the ability to run NFL routes will boost his stock.
--NAME-- knows how to use his athletic ability to his advantage and is a dynamic player. Despite his size, he is an effective and even lethal threat at the line of scrimmage, as he can get a quick step on a corner and be open from the get-off. His quickness off the line of scrimmage makes up for his size. He is capable of being a serious deep threat yet also has the quickness and ball skills to be effective in the short-to-intermediate game. As a route runner, --NAME-- has shown an understanding of how to lean on a defender to gain separation and stem his routes to set up his quick step to separate. --NAME-- understands the strong suits of his game and plays to them. With the ball in his hands, he can create plays for himself and use vision and body control to weave upfield and bounce off would-be tacklers. Most importantly, he has the uncanny ability to separate from defenders and get open across the field, a skill that's highly desired at the next level.
-------------------------
Jarius_Wright 2532978 118
--NAME-- has been a consistent starter for Arkansas since his freshman year. He is undersized but has legitimate 4.4 speed in the 40-yard dash, which he uses well in all aspects of his game. He wasn't used much as a returner, but he is an option for NFL teams there based off his ball handling, quickness and long speed. He has fourth-round value working out of the slot at the next level.
--NAME-- is undersized, and although he gives great effort in the run game, he struggles to sustain his blocks. He utilizes quick feet off the line but can get jammed up by bigger corners.
--NAME-- is a very quick player who understands how to work out of the slot and sit down in the hole of a zone defense. He is tough in traffic and a deep threat who runs good routes. He understands the angling aspect of route running and how to create separation. He has quick hands to snag the ball in short throws and the ability to reel it in deep. He could add value at the return positions, although he hasn't displayed much on special teams in college.
-------------------------
Devon_Wylie 2532979 107
--NAME-- is an undersized receiver from Fresno State who was actually never a full-time starter during his time there. He has battled injuries throughout his career, and this has greatly hampered his productivity but also has made him a hidden gem of a prospect who has fourth-round value based off his ability to contribute as a starter immediately in the return game. He is a burner whose 40-yard dash time will greatly help and support his grade despite limited playing time at a Western Athletic Conference school.
--NAME-- is an undersized receiver who has been limited by injuries throughout his career. Teams will be turned off by his durability and inability to consistently see the field at Fresno State.
--NAME-- is highly effective as a returner, as he is very decisive and has the speed to make one cut and get upfield to take it the distance. As a receiver, he is very quick off the ball and gets into his route immediately. He understands how to use his quick feet to get off the line without cornerbacks pushing him off his route. He is a good route runner who can get open thanks to his acceleration and ability to break on a dime. He is a consummate deep threat and could be effective running quick screens and getting yards after the catch at the next level.
-------------------------
Kevin_Zeitler 2532980 27
--NAME-- has been a regular starter when healthy over the past three years on extremely productive offensive lines at Wisconsin. All of his linemates have been considered professional run blockers with the size to match, and he is no different. --NAME-- is well coached and technical in his pass set. He has second- or third-round value due because of his experience playing on a productive line and being polished enough to play early.
--NAME-- is a big man with heavy legs who at times labors to get moving when he needs to get out of his set and pull. His body control can be inconsistent at times, as he occasionally will whiff on linebackers. He is slower than desirable and is better off working in close proximity to his man to control the block.
--NAME-- displays very quick movement off the line and gets into his blocks quickly. He can blow a defender back and drive his legs to sustain blocks throughout run plays. He stands out in his work at the second level, where he has the ability to bend his knees and engage linebackers. He can quickly pull from his spot off the line.
-------------------------
Charles_Mitchell 2532981 192
--NAME-- is an experienced corner who stands out as a smart and reliable player on the back end. He started for three years and is a smooth athlete who would look natural as a spot starter in the NFL. He is a bit short but understands how to play the position. He is a controlled athlete, can trigger his feet to turn and get to a spot and has the body control to make a play on the ball or dip his hips to make a play against the run. --NAME-- has fifth-round potential.
--NAME-- does not make many big plays and is not a ball hawk. He is better against the run than the pass, and hasn't had much experience in man coverage. He plays well within a scheme but isn't necessarily a safety who can make his own plays; he is often around the ball but hasn't had a ton of turnover production.
--NAME-- is strong for the position. He has average size but his strength shows in the run game. He diagnoses plays well and you can tell he is a preparation-based player; he is always in position. He is good in zone coverage, where he recognizes plays early working within the scheme and turns to get to the ball quickly. In run support he plays the position well and triggers to get downfield quickly and fill his lane. He rarely misses a tackle.
-------------------------
Johnnie_Troutman 2532983 149
--NAME-- has started for three years at Penn State at offensive guard and is a fierce blocker when finishing plays. He is able to use superior arm strength to hold on and sustain his blocks, but he has some hitches in his footwork that limit him in pass protection. As a mover, he gets to the second level well and can stay on his man. He is a much better run blocker than pass blocker and should find a role as a backup player in the NFL. He has late-round value, but he hasn't blown anyone away and needs a strong performance in the pre-draft process to ensure he'll be drafted after showing up as a disruptive mover against Houston in the Ticket City Bowl.
--NAME-- has good technique in the run game, but he struggles in his pass set. He can make explosive blocks once he meets his man, but he can get overpowered when having to move to the second level or deal with a quick-twitched interior defensive lineman. He is probably better suited for the right side of the line, as he could be a liability in pass protection and be outmaneuvered by the NFL's top athletes.
--NAME-- is a good run blocker who understands how to use technique to overcome certain deficiencies  in his game. He has a wide base and a good anchor to sustain on his blocks, and he is able to generate a little bit of a pop off the ball to move his defensive lineman backward. He mirrors opponents well and stays with his man by using strong hands in the run game. He is flexible and an overall reliable inside option for a run-heavy team.
-------------------------
Terrance_Ganaway 2532984 202
--NAME-- has been a nice supplementary asset to the Baylor offense. He had an impressive showing against Washington in a bowl game and showed why he is more than just an afterthought to Robert Griffin III in Baylor's offense. While he may have benefited from the holes that his Heisman-winning quarterback and top-wide receiver prospect (Kendall  Wright) opened up for him in the run game due to their stellar pass play, --NAME-- is a legitimate prospect in his own right. He shows good initial quickness, a burst through the line and seriously imposing size that give him fourth- or fifth-round value.
--NAME-- is somewhat of a passive player for his size. Once through the hole, he doesn't look to deliver a blow that he could with his body. He can stutter step at times, too, waiting for plays to develop. He will need to hit the hole with more authority at the next level.
--NAME-- is a huge back, and he plays that way. He is very quick out of his stance to hit the hole for such a big back, but he also shows the patience and savvy to let plays develop for him. Once to the hole he can make a guy miss or run through him, although he doesn't run with the power you'd expect out of a back his size. He is very reliable as a pass catcher and ran a lot of polished routes out of the backfield for RG3. He has the temperament of a special teams player and, given his strong ball security, could play early on, especially in short-yardage situations.
-------------------------
Deangelo_Tyson 2532985 236
--NAME-- has been a reliable interior lineman for an effective and explosive Bulldogs defense. He has the size to play both the 3- and 5-techniques at the next level and is very strong against the run. --NAME-- has the size and competitiveness to be a force in an NFL rotation. He understands his role within a defense and has some versatility working across the line. If he can display greater athletic ability and speed than he showed on film throughout his collegiate career, look for him to be a late riser and be selected in the sixth or seventh round come April after showing up as a strong run-defender against Michigan State in the Outback Bowl.
--NAME-- offers next to nothing as a pass rusher. Although it isn't a high priority to contribute against the pass as an interior lineman, --NAME-- will be hurt by the fact that he doesn't have much scheme versatility, and as a 3- and 5-technique player he will be relied upon to create some sort of havoc for quarterbacks. He is a long strider and doesn't work well in short areas, which limits his effectiveness against the pass. The major shortcoming in his play is his poor reaction time to plays. He needs to learn how to read the flow of offensive linemen at the next level to be effective when slanting and diagnosing plays.
--NAME-- is a big and strong interior force. He can hold up blocks well to keep his linebackers clean. He gives good effort in the open field and displays some athletic ability there. He is strong when locking out against engaged offensive linemen and really impresses when shedding his man. He can get off a block and ignite a powerful step into pursuit. He is a reliable tackler once he reaches the ball carrier.
-------------------------
Tahir_Whitehead 2532986 138
--NAME-- is a solid linebacker prospect who will not blow anyone away with his play, but he is serviceable and will be a good special teams player at the next level. He is a competitive defender who likes to work against the run but is even better at mauling tight ends and keeping them out of their routes. He doesn't do as well when covering his man downfield, and he has limited value on pass plays. He carries fifth- or sixth-round value.
--NAME-- is a run defender and should only be relied upon to re-route receivers early when working in the passing game. He doesn't change directions well when running with players downfield against the pass, a problem that will persist in the NFL. He doesn't look natural when dropping into zone coverage and shouldn't be put in a scheme in which he has to defend the pass often.
--NAME-- is very good at using his hands and arm strength to harass tight ends at the line of scrimmage. He has a good base and he likes to get under tight ends and bigger linemen to throw them off their stance at the snap. He can chase a play down across the field, but he is more of a long-speed runner and isn't as great in short areas. He is a solid tackler inside who could get the job done against NFL linemen.
-------------------------
Travian_Robertson 2532987 249
--NAME-- is a big man who shows good effort in the trenches. He has experience against good offensive lines in the SEC. He is stiff at times and almost overdeveloped, as his muscle can inhibit his movements. He has a difficult time reacting to plays and needs a scheme where he can rely on his size and strength to hold linemen away from the second level. He won't contribute much in the pass game, but he is a big man who has good technique, making him a late-round prospect.
--NAME-- is solely a hold-up lineman who does little else. He has a tough time getting in the backfield and reaching the ball carrier. He is slow off the snap and he doesn't create plays for himself. He is the type of player who could make a lot of money playing in the right scheme, but his statistical productivity likely will be extremely low at the next level.
--NAME-- is very good once he gets off the ball to immobilize offensive lineman and keep linebackers free. He is a leverage player who, though stiff, understands what it takes to get under a lineman and gain an advantage early. He is extremely strong and has surprisingly developed hand technique. His strength is obvious when he sheds linemen.
-------------------------
Evan_Rodriguez 2532991 111
--NAME-- is an interesting prospect in that teams will have to find abnormal ways to get him the ball in space at the next level. He has the physical traits to play in the NFL. --NAME-- has true tweener size and isn't an obvious tight end or fullback. He is a serviceable player at the next level in the short passing game.
--NAME-- is almost nonexistent in the pass game, and his athletic ability is suspect when attempting to get to the second level and block linebackers. He may have a tough time winning with strength or speed at the next level, two traits that players in his role often rely on.
--NAME-- is a very reliable pass catcher who is a crafty route runner. He was a go-to look for Temple to pick up first downs and maneuver through defenders for extra yardage. He is quick off the ball and understands how to leverage his body. He is a smooth runner who looks natural in the open field.
-------------------------
Jack_Crawford 2532992 158
--NAME-- started for three years at Penn State and has just five years of experience at his position. He was a late bloomer who moved to the United States from England to play basketball in high school before picking up football and, eventually, a scholarship from Penn State. He is a developmental prospect who can still fill out his incredible frame. He is a late-round prospect who could be taken earlier if a team can live with developing him. He is an inconsistent player at this point in his career. He barely showed up against Houston in the Ticket City Bowl and logged only one pass defensed -- a microcosm of his career at Penn State, where he generally just stood up and hoped to knock down balls with his frame.
--NAME-- is still developing as a football player. It is obvious at times that he hasn't been playing the game very long; he has difficulty reading offensive lines and reacting to plays against the run. Once there, he is disruptive and effective, but he could be a deer in headlights early on at the next level. He is not very quick off the ball and will need to continue to develop his speed and burst. He looks nice but can't really burst in short areas to get to the quarterback and finish the play.
--NAME-- has an amazing frame for defensive end. Taller than 6-foot-5, he is going to get his hands up and disrupt passes at the next level. Even if he has to develop early on, he can contribute right away in this aspect. He is athletic for his position and it shows when he is running down cross-field plays. He is adept at shedding blocks and getting to the ball. For a raw player, he has a surprising feel when working against the run game. He struggles against the pass and is still developing his technique to be more effective there, but his frame gives him plenty of potential.
-------------------------
Donald_Stephenson 2532993 74
--NAME-- is a big offensive lineman who has been versatile at the tackle position. Far from a powerful mover, he is somewhat of a finesse blocker. He is quick in the run game and nasty when finishing plays. He relies more on competitiveness than strength to get the job done, but the fact that he's played both left and right tackle for a major program makes him a late-round pick with backup potential.
--NAME-- is not very strong despite his size. It seems he is always in a stalemate and forcing himself to rely on his footwork rather than his strength. He is quick off the line but not explosive. He can get blown back by more explosive players in pass blocking.
--NAME-- is very quick out of his stance, and this is his one shining quality. Has good footwork and is a lateral mover who can get beat by strength but recovers well to not allow sacks. Good when pulling and working in the open field; has more value as a mover and second-level blocker. He can be nasty when finishing plays and is a reliable protector of the quarterback.
-------------------------
Terrence_Frederick 2532996 246
--NAME-- is an undersized corner who started for Texas A&M and played a variety of roles throughout his career. He is slow-footed, which can be his defining attribute as he struggles off the line playing close in man coverage; he is much more of a zone player. He often has played in the slot in nickel packages in his career, which will help him early on in his transition to the NFL. He gets the most out of his athletic ability by being a smart player who takes good angles on the ball.
--NAME-- is not a man-cover corner and would struggle early if put in that situation in the NFL. He is slow-footed and can get blown by off the snap when in man coverage. He is a bit undersized and struggles on the line against bigger receivers. He is inconsistent and almost bashful when playing man coverage. He appears unsure of his speed when running with a receiver down field.
--NAME-- is a very good zone defender who understands angles. He knows how to diagnose plays and watches his man's hips and then turns his eyes to the quarterback to make breaks when playing zone. This can get him in trouble at times, but he wins more often than not when reacting to the quarterback and breaking on the ball. --NAME-- is a solid, good-base athlete who plays that way on the edge when supporting the run. Although he is slightly undersized, he likes to throw his body around and won't just stick on blocks, which is the knock on some undersized corners.
-------------------------
Shaun_Prater 2532997 156
--NAME-- is an athletic corner who has the quickness and mental makeup to play early at the next level. He was a three-year starter at Iowa and has been a good player against some strong talent. He will be hindered by a poor finish to his senior year that culminated in a rough showing against Oklahoma and some NFL-caliber talent.
--NAME-- can struggle in man to understand when the ball is thrown. He seems lost at times when having to look back toward the quarterback. He is just average in run support and tackling.
--NAME-- is an athletic guy, he is able to cover in man and has the burst and recognition to react well when playing zone. In man, he has the hips and footwork to mirror his man down the field and the recognition to make a play on the ball. He understands how to work back in zone and see players in front of him, and he has a much better burst from a still position to react to thrown balls than he does to stay with a man deep.
-------------------------
Christian_Thompson 2532998 130
--NAME-- is an intriguing big safety from little-known South Carolina State. He is very athletic and dominated in stretches throughout college. He struggles to make plays on the ball in coverage and doesn't always react well in zone, but he is a very athletic mover capable of covering tight ends at the next level. He is a bit of an unknown but could continue to rise throughout the pre-draft process, and his value could be understated at this time given the emergence of athletic tight ends in the NFL in 2011.
--NAME-- is raw and hasn't played against top talent in college. He struggles at times in zone and can look out of sorts. He is unreliable when given the opportunity to catch the ball, although he is around it often. He doesn't have speed that translates to the field when he is in pursuit; he will need to rely on his footwork more than he does at the current time so that he doesn't get out of position and have to chase at the next level.
--NAME-- is a big-time athlete who can match up with the NFL's biggest and fastest offensive players. He excels in man coverage, where he uses his quick-twitched feet and smooth hips to cover. He is good in off-man coverage, where he can sit and wait on a move before reacting and then blanketing. He understands the game and assists in run support, although he is a better tackler against the pass than he is straight up against the run. He would fit in right away on an NFL defense.
-------------------------
Frank_Alexander 2532999 103
A two-year starter at defensive end for Oklahoma, --NAME-- could have some versatility given that he has been in a stand-up position occasionally. He has some girth and could be an option at outside linebacker for a team that could live with a pure rusher who doesn't cover much in the flats. --NAME-- is a high-energy player who uses his length well and could be a good rotational option at the next level. He should be drafted in the late rounds.
--NAME-- struggles when double-teamed. He might be a better fit as an outside linebacker in a 3-4 scheme; doesn't bend real well and gets stopped in his tracks when overpowered. It takes time to get his big frame moving.
--NAME-- is a lengthy athlete and uses his arms well against the run. He sheds blocks well, is instinctual from a three-point stance or standing up, and is a natural player on the edge. He can make plays once in the backfield and is a solid all-around edge prospect.
-------------------------
Bryan_Anger 2533000 70
The strong-legged, consistent --NAME-- is one of the few punters teams should consider taking with a late-round pick. He could come into training camp and steal a starting spot from a veteran. Teams love paying rookie salaries to their kickers and punters.
--NAME-- struggles to get height on his kicks, though he does get them off quick. He can drive the ball deep, but it often comes down quickly, a flaw that might prove costly at the pro level.
--NAME-- is very accurate and employs a wide array of styles. He can execute both Aussie and rugby kicks, which will help him pin teams deep. With so many big legs around the league, it is crucial to excel in this area. He can play the ball to either side of the field, is quick and athletic, and has the strength to start in the NFL.
-------------------------
Miles_Burris 2533004 129
--NAME-- is a very instinctive, "fly-around" linebacker with the size and strength to play a number of roles in the NFL. Fast and physical, he will contribute on special teams and could even contest for a starting role. He is likely as good as he's going to get, but would be a solid value as a fifth- or sixth-round pick.
--NAME-- is not an outstanding pass defender; he gets the job done, but he can be exposed in space. He could be like the Patriots' Brandon Spikes, who also has trouble defending the pass.
On one play, --NAME-- will blow up screens, and on the next, he'll turn and run downfield with a tight end. He works well within the box, using his size and strength to shed linemen. He understands his role, quickly filling gaps or getting outside to set on a fullback and force the ball-carrier inside. A natural linebacker, --NAME-- can drop into zone coverage and work in man-to-man. He could also be a great candidate to play inside linebacker in a 3-4 defense.
-------------------------
Jaye_Howard 2533006 114
--NAME-- is a thick interior lineman who has great size and can make impact plays working from his defensive tackle position. He can disappear for stretches, as he did in games for the Gators, and this will be the major concern surrounding his transition to the next level.
--NAME-- is very inconsistent. There were times at Florida when he would just let himself get blocked. He is late to disengage from his man on many plays. When he sees an opening, he can hit it and make a big play, but he shouldn't be relied upon to defeat blocks and make plays on his own.
--NAME-- has been a durable player for the Gators. He is very quick off the ball for his size, although he can forget his technique (a testament to his inconsistent play) and rise up to get stonewalled by offensive linemen at times. He is very good against the run and has the ability to snap off the ball, engage a lineman, then work off him to move laterally towards a running back and make a big-time play in the backfield.
-------------------------
Demario_Davis 2533008 77
--NAME-- is a big linebacker who is competitive and had a lot of tackles for Arkansas State. Speed is by far his best asset. He could run a 4.5 40-yard dash in the pre-draft process, and that kind of speed is hard to ignore. --NAME-- is big enough to play the position in the NFL, and has fifth-round value to a team that needs a guy who can run down plays and be effective against both the pass and run. --NAME-- can be an awesome special teams candidate early on, which likely will be the key reason he is on a field in Week 1 of the 2012 NFL season.
--NAME-- needs to gather better when running down plays from the inside-out. He is so fast that he can overrun guys at times and fly off them as his momentum takes him outside on a tackle. Against one-cut runners at the NFL level, he could have a tough time gathering to make a secure tackle on the run. His athletic ability really doesn't translate to pass defense, where he can look awkward and out of place at times. He needs to learn to better diagnose plays because he could struggle against faster offenses.
--NAME-- can really run, and it shows in every play he is in against the run. He has a burst in short areas and can run down almost any back to meet him outside the tackles and cover the outside run. He chases hard and fast every play and would be an excellent option to play outside linebacker in a 4-3 defense. He is a good tackler and has that obvious explosion to drive through his hips and really deliver a blow on a ball carrier.
-------------------------
Tony_Bergstrom 2533010 95
--NAME--, a three-year starter at Utah, missed two years of playing time while on a religious mission and is a relatively old prospect. He is mature, reliable and didn't allowed many sacks in college. A very good mover in space, he gets to the second level well. Although he hasn't played guard, he has the potential to succeed at that position in the NFL. Wherever he plays, --NAME-- is a solid, low-risk prospect who could eventually develop into a starter. He should be able to settle into a backup role in the early going, and will likely go in one of the later rounds.
--NAME-- is not very explosive, almost weak for an offensive lineman. He doesn't get much of a jolt when working off the ball and struggles to get much movement in the run game. Again, he is not a very aggressive blocker, acting as more of a catcher who uses his feet and hands to react and mirror. He is reliable, big and a student of the game, but won't blow anyone away in the NFL.
--NAME-- moves well in space. He is not a very aggressive blocker, but when pulling, he can chop his feet, gather his weight and settle into a position that allows him to move and sustain. He is a technically sound player who uses his hands well. He looks natural in his pass set and gets his  hands ready early to fight off rushers. He isn't very strong, but can use his feet and technique to work on the line and block reliably.
-------------------------
Blair_Walsh 2533011 175
--NAME-- is a three-year starter with an active and strong leg. He consistently puts the ball in the end zone on kickoffs and has been reliable enough that a team with a need may select him to keep him off the free-agent market.
--NAME-- has been inaccurate at times when he tries to drive the ball too hard.
--NAME-- is a confident kicker who will let it rip from beyond 60 yards. He is most reliable in mid-range kicks. He is a good athlete who is capable of making a tackle as a last resort.
-------------------------
Vick_Ballard 2533012 170
--NAME-- is a big back who was productive throughout his time at Mississippi State. He is very effective running between the tackles. He is also athletic in space and understands blocking in the pass game, traits that could make him a reliable third-down option. He will probably be able to contribute immediately in pass protection, which will likely entice a running back-needy team to take him in one of the later rounds.
--NAME-- is not what one would call a quick-twitch athlete. He is big but doesn't run with a ton of power; bigger linebackers often bring him down on first contact. He is instinctive inside and while carrying the ball in the flats, but he is not fast enough to get to the edge on his own. He is natural between the tackles but can look like a deer in headlights in the open field.
--NAME-- is a very instinctive runner. He has a natural ability to sift through defenders in the backfield and shows good burst after he's broken through the line. He is a good runner and has deceptive juke moves that he will use on bigger players. --NAME-- carries the ball high and tight and is conscious of oncoming traffic, making him dependable inside. He is a big body, willing to block oncoming linebackers in pass protection. He also understands how to work upfield for the first down after catching the ball, making him a good check-down option in the pass game. --NAME-- is a willing special-teams player who seeks contact and likes to fly around.
-------------------------
Najee_Goode 2533016 140
--NAME-- is a bit of a tweener in that he bounced from inside to outside linebacker in his career at West Virginia. NFL teams will face the same dilemma West Virginia did when deciding where to play him. He played outside for much of his career, serving as the flow tackler for a defense that featured classmate Bruce Irvin at outside linebacker. --NAME-- had a solid year working from the inside and can clash with top offensive linemen. He has 3-4 and 4-3 base defense versatility as well, which  makes him a late-round prospect.
--NAME-- won't be very reliable against the pass in the NFL and is more of a two-down defender. He has the speed to run with bigger offensive players but would struggle dropping back to cover slot receivers. He has the same struggles in zone coverage, where he doesn't look natural when flipping his hips and getting into his pass set. He doesn't contribute much when rushing the passer and doesn't have the burst or technique to get around more experienced linemen.
--NAME-- is a solid tackler and works better in the box than he does in space. He can read linemen and fill his gaps adequately. He uses good leverage when going against bigger linemen and can deliver a blow to oncoming running backs. --NAME-- has the strength to back up a 240-pound frame -- he doesn't let offensive linemen stick on him for long. --NAME-- is a classic inside presence who struggles turning to cover in zone and is better suited playing against the run.
-------------------------
Markus_Kuhn 2533019 239
--NAME-- is a big interior defensive lineman who only started for one year at North Carolina State. He showed good effort in that year in all areas of his play, is good to run down plays from the backside and will be a force working from within. He struggles against double teams and doesn't play very instinctively yet, but he is a developmental project and has late-round value to a team that can afford to wait on his development.
--NAME-- is very raw and it shows when he works against double teams or attempts to rush the passer. He has a difficult time working against more than one man and teams will take advantage of this early in his career. He is not very sound in his technique using his hands and has a ways to go before he is ready to be influential in the NFL.
--NAME-- is quick off the ball, and is more of a force working inside against the pass than he is vs. the run, where he can get neutralized at times by forward-moving lines. He shows good effort.
-------------------------
Dwight_Bentley 2533024 85
--NAME--, a four-year starter at Louisiana-Lafayette, is a classic, undersized corner from a small school who has the athletic ability to contend for an NFL roster spot. He will be downgraded for his size and the relatively low caliber of competition that he faced in college, but he is very quick and instinctive. He would be a good option for a team that wants to engender a competition at the cornerback position in training camp. He could have trouble in man-to-man coverage, but he is a good athlete and a team might take a flier on him in one of the later rounds of the draft to see if he can continue to develop.
--NAME--'s struggles with man-to-man coverage in college could be a huge issue for him in the NFL. At Louisiana-Lafayette, --NAME-- played a lot of zone coverage, which didn't require him to use his footwork or handle receivers on his own as much as he would be asked to do in a man-to-man scheme. He is also basically a non-entity with regard to run defense. Because of his size, he struggles to play with physicality. This could hamper his pro career, given that he will undoubtedly have to be a special-teams player in order to stick early on.
--NAME--'s athleticism shows whenever the ball is thrown near him. He can jump and adjust his body to make plays, and is very natural when working on the line of scrimmage and in zone coverage. He drives his foot aggressively and moves toward the ball when working the flats in Cover-2 formation. He is a "blanketer" at the top of routes, good at staying with his man to contest passes.
-------------------------
Derek_Wolfe 2533026 36
--NAME-- is a big interior lineman who plays very instinctively to be a factor in the run game. He is a slow-moving, pedestrian athlete, but this doesn't define his ability -- he finds other ways to be a factor. He can get overpowered by double teams and will need to continue to develop his technique to not be erased when he faces them. Based off his frame and potential, he has late-round value in the draft.
--NAME-- struggles off the ball to get into his slants. He is a slow mover and will not blow back any offensive lineman off the ball. He sometimes relies too heavily on his ability to diagnose, as it appears he is reading the play so long that blockers negate him. Double teams will give him a lot of trouble and he is on his back often when faced with them; NFL teams will see right through that and get an extra hand on him in the run game.
--NAME-- is an instinctive player who understands how to engage a lineman, extend his arms and read the flow of the play to move off his blocks. He sees screens well and can work off his man to disrupt plays inside. He can defeat single blocks well and is a decent pass rusher when put in the right scheme where he can slant and stunt to get in good position.
-------------------------
James_Hanna 2533028 186
--NAME-- is a thick tight end who is much more of a crafty receiving threat than he is a blocker, and has been consistent throughout his two years as a starter at Oklahoma. He is a good catcher and can adjust well to poorly thrown balls, even with a man draped over him. --NAME-- is a straight-line runner who isn't very good at maneuvering in his routes, but his speed is deceptive and he just possesses the "it" factor when it comes to making a catch at the top of his routes. He is a limited prospect who could be taken in the late rounds of the draft, but he will come in, compete and potentially make a team based off his willingness to play special teams and skills as a pass-catching tight end. He only had two catches for 18 yards against Iowa in the Insight Bowl, which wasn't far off his average and about what type of player he is: reliable to make a few tough catches, but not going to have any sort of "Rob Gronkowski-type production" from the position anytime soon.
--NAME-- is not a very fast player and isn't athletic off the ball. He struggles when mauled at the line. The scouting report on him at the next level will be to get a bigger linebacker to disrupt his route early and prevent him from ever getting into space. He can catch a contested ball, but he isn't tough across the middle -- there were many times during the 2011 season when an oncoming safety gave him "alligator arms" and he was caught ducking under balls to avoid the hit. He is better when a guy is running with him in man coverage and he doesn't have to worry about a big blow, but the fact that he doesn't display toughness down field or when working as a blocker on the line makes him a limited prospect overall.
--NAME-- can catch the ball when it is thrown in his area. He is athletic, and can maneuver his body at full speed to reach around or over a defender to make a catch. He is an aware player who is reliable to pick up a first town. He has a tight torso and can spin around to make a catch, then turn, run and roll over safeties. He understands how to run good routes. Actually running them at the next level will be a different story, however.
-------------------------
Tank_Carder 2533029 147
--NAME-- has been a highly effective player ever since his shining performance during the Rose Bowl in January 2011. The reliable and consistent high-motor linebacker might not have the athletic ability to be drafted, but teams will have a hard time letting him get through camp unsigned. His competitiveness and toughness should land him a spot as a backup and special teams player. He didn't play much with the special teams unit in college, but he could be a contributor there in the NFL for years to come.
--NAME-- is a bit undersized and isn't fast enough to start in the NFL right away. His lack of athleticism can be exposed when he has to drop into coverage and scan the field for crossing routes. He needs to work toward the ball to be productive, and relies very heavily on instincts. Many will question his athletic ability; --NAME-- must have strong workouts before the draft.
The Mountain West defensive player of the year was extremely steady. He is active in the run game and relies heavily on his instincts to diagnose plays and hit his gaps. He is big, strong and a productive tackler. He knows how to read offensive lines, and will fight his way into the NFL.
-------------------------
Andrew_Luck 2533031 1
Even with the late rise of Heisman Trophy-winning QB Robert Griffin III, --NAME-- is considered one of the surest prospects in the past decade. He is a prototypical pro-style quarterback who can make all the line calls, formation shifts, pass drops, and throws necessary to be successful at the next level. He will likely be the top pick overall and start immediately.
There are no glaring weaknesses in --NAME--'s play, and while some could argue he isn't the athlete that RG3 is, that is simply not his game. He displays the athleticism necessary to excel as a pocket passer. There are times when --NAME-- second-guessed passes and simply didn't see a breaking corner coming from another zone, such as the play that almost got Stanford beat toward the end of a high-energy USC game, but for the most part --NAME-- works to identify and improve on his weaknesses.
--NAME--'s intangibles are what set him apart from other talented quarterbacks. He is tough, durable and willing to step into a throw with oncoming rushers breathing down his neck. He has a deliberate set-up with no wasted motions and has developed and the ability to play from many different looks at Stanford. --NAME-- has the size to take a hit, and the athletic ability to get outside and make plays with his feet. On the move, he makes his second and third reads with ease. He has a very compact and quick release, and can fire it out to the flats with ease off one-step drops. The most intriguing aspect of --NAME--'s career was the scant number of mistakes he made. He rarely forces a ball into tight coverage. He won't make any mistakes off the field, either. He is a strong, natural, competitive, athletic quarterback.
-------------------------
Trent_Richardson 2533032 3
--NAME-- is a talented back who should garner a top-five pick in this year's draft, regardless of the idea that the shelf life of running backs doesn't warrant the risk of a top pick. --NAME-- is durable enough to handle a season full of carries, and with the new CBA rules putting a ceiling on rookie salaries, it will be tough for teams to pass on such a talented, polished back.
--NAME-- ran behind a very good, experienced line at Alabama. He will likely prove that he has the talent to make plays on his own, but much of his production were yards on plays in a good scheme with a seam and an opportunity to get to linebacker and safety level without much trouble. He may have more trouble getting to the perimeter at the next level.
--NAME-- is as compact and coiled an athlete as the position has seen since Adrian Peterson. --NAME-- is explosive, powerful and balanced. He is a heady and instinctual player who is patient enough to wait for blocks and quick enough to cut backfield to daylight. --NAME-- has a strong core that he uses to break arm tackles and get physical leverage under blitzers in pass protection. He is a true three-down back who can be effective on screens.
-------------------------
Robert_Griffin_III 2533033 2
Many would argue that Griffin --NAME-- is not only the most physically gifted quarterback in the 2012 draft, but also that he is the most talented player overall. His intangibles are making so many general managers swoon. Griffin, because of his athletic ability and Joe Montana-like ability to extend plays and remain focused on moving the ball downfield, not to mention his hurdling ability, could stand to be the better physical prospect than presumed Number 1 pick Andrew Luck. Nonetheless, RG3 likely will be a top-five pick.
Griffin has a slight size deficiency and could have some durability issues if he is hit often enough. He anticipates plays so well and is able to react to a point where he should be able to avoid big hits, even at the NFL level. His junior year was a test to see how well he could recover from a torn anterior cruciate ligament suffered during his sophomore year, and he came back just as strong. Some might worry that he will look to run first at the next level, but this easily could be curbed through coaching and a good support system on the offense. He truly had one strong season in college, but playing in a talented Big 12 conference and winning the Heisman likely puts those concerns to rest, as well.
Griffin is a talented quarterback who was built for the position. Although he is slightly undersized, his athletic ability lends well to him being an NFL-type quarterback who can make plays with his feet, extend plays, make the deep throw and lead a team down the field. He has some of the same natural talents that Cam Newton had in the 2011 draft, sans the size. Griffin overcomes a slight size deficiency by simply being so athletic that defenders rarely get a shot on him. It is apparent that Griffin, once a high school hurdler, is extremely explosive. He drops back with absolute ease. He is able to feel comfortable enough in the pocket to step into a throw in traffic or reset outside the pocket. At this point, unlike Luck, he can also move the ball downfield with his feet. While many would argue that RG3 might be an athlete playing quarterback, his junior-year performance reaffirmed that he is simply an athletic quarterback, a guy who can make all the smart throws first and create later if necessary.
-------------------------
Lamar_Miller 2533034 97
--NAME-- is an early-entry true junior from Miami who really surprised in 2011, his first year as a starter. --NAME-- has put together enough solid tape to garner a late first-round value and should continue to excite and ascend as he displays his athletic ability throughout the pre-draft process.
--NAME-- has only one full season of tape and was rather ineffective as a runner prior to this year. He relies on speed and leg drive to gain yards. He won't be able to juke linebackers at the next level or bail himself out of bad spots with his feet. He runs like a power back at times, which could be a liability in the NFL at his size.
--NAME-- has track speed and actually ran a few anchor legs for the Miami track team prior to his junior year. Once in the open field, he is a threat to take it the distance and is not only a straight-line, long-speed runner; --NAME-- has even more impressive quickness off the snap and in tight areas to avoid and stay productive. He hardly ever gets stuck in the backfield and is reliable to get positive yardage on each carry.
-------------------------
David_Wilson 2533035 32
--NAME-- is an electrifying runner who opted to come out early after an incredible junior year in which he was named ACC Player of the Year. He truly runs with his own style, and it's obvious that he has a love for the game. He is a high-risk, high-reward player who loves to reverse field on the entire defense. He is a decorated track star who is a threat to the defense every time he touches the ball.
--NAME-- relied heavily on his athletic ability in college and runs with a very unconventional style that could get him in trouble at the next level. He will allow his pad level to get high when changing directions downfield, and he will get caught off guard with that style in the NFL. He isn't content with a 3-yard gain and will reverse field in an attempt to make a play out of nothing, another habit that won't end well in most cases. He needs to be more patient to let the plays and blocks come to him, rather than try to make everything happen on his own each time he gets the ball.
--NAME-- is extremely explosive and quick-twitched off the snap. He can quickly accelerate to top speed, and he makes the most of his small frame by lowering his pad level into hits. He is so explosive and generates such movement with his leg drive that he is capable of running over linebackers, but he prefers to use his agility to make guys miss in space. --NAME-- is just as electric working as a receiver out of the backfield or in the slot as he is as a ball carrier, and he could be used in a variety of alignments.
-------------------------
LaMichael_James 2533036 61
--NAME-- had a decorated career at Oregon and started all but two games after redshirting in 2007. An invitee to the Heisman Trophy presentation the past two years, --NAME-- has been the most electric and productive player on a very impressive offense. He was an ideal fit for the unique zone blocking scheme run by Chip Kelly and has shown many traits that are transferable to the NFL. Teams could get hung up on his size, but he has shown quality traits on a consistent basis.
--NAME-- had fumbling issues throughout his career that weren't helped by a dislocated elbow midway through his junior season. He looks conscious of keeping the ball high and tight to his frame, and he has very good all-around strength, but he doesn't have the arm strength to secure the ball when big hits are put on him. He is a willing and technical blocker in pass protection but simply doesn't have the bulk or anchor to be successful here early at the next level.
--NAME-- is a quick and decisive back who looks like his motive is to be productive each time the ball touches his hands. He can get to full speed quickly off the snap and doesn't hesitate when hitting the line of scrimmage. He is capable of making splash plays out of nothing. He is a better runner between the tackles than his frame would suggest, as he uses a quick shuffle to avoid trash or get up and into an open lane. Once through the line, he can make things happen on his own downfield, and routinely had runs of 20-plus yards at Oregon. He is always a threat to score, and has the foot quickness and breakout speed to get the edge at the next level.
-------------------------
Justin_Blackmon 2533038 5
--NAME-- enjoyed a storied and productive career at Oklahoma State, winning the Biletnikoff Award (given to the country's top collegiate wide receiver) two years in a row. --NAME-- is as athletic as former teammate Dez Bryant and was even more productive, filling in nicely for Bryant when he left for the NFL. --NAME-- has the elite ability to contribute immediately and should be a top-15 draft pick.
--NAME-- is not as quick off the ball as his athleticism would suggest. He has good top-end speed and acceleration in the open field, but struggles to get enough burst to separate in short areas. An elongated stride makes it difficult for him to run sharp routes. Much of his production came from making plays at the point of the catch and after; he doesn't get himself open through route-running. He is an all-or-nothing blocker who can't recover after whiffing, and will have to improve in that area. His stride hampers his ability to change direction and could be his biggest problem in the NFL, where he'll be covered by premier athletes.
--NAME-- has a good frame and seems taller than he is. He is barely six-feet tall, but his elite leaping ability makes him a jump-ball, red-zone threat. He can excel from any spot on the field, and is reminiscent of Anquan Boldin when running "drive" and "underneath" routes. --NAME-- will present serious matchup issues for opposing defenses when working out of the slot, which he did occasionally in college. His in-phase technique is extremely polished, and he can vary his speed to keep defenders off balance. He is slow off the line but uses his strength and jab steps to release with ease. A natural receiver, --NAME-- understands how to read coverage and sit down in zones. He aggressively attacks the ball when it's in his large catching radius, and he uses his frame to box out defenders. He can also bail out quarterbacks with his skill for adjusting to poorly thrown balls on the run.
-------------------------
Alshon_Jeffery 2533039 45
--NAME-- enjoyed highly productive sophomore and junior years at South Carolina, where he was a first-team All-America selection and averaged over a touchdown a game. He is an explosive jumper with an impressive frame and has the ability to be an immediate red-zone threat in the NFL. He is a long strider who is methodical in his route running but has just average speed. He relies on technique and variations in his speed.
--NAME-- is an elite jump-ball prospect, but he does not stand out as fast on tape and is such a long strider that at times he looks to be moving in slow motion. Speed will never be his game, but he needs to become more comfortable in his routes to work the corner and truly gain separation. The development of his route-running skills will be the key to his success. --NAME-- was bit uncoordinated early in his career and only began to look comfortable in his body toward the end of his collegiate career.
--NAME-- is a lanky prospect who uses his size well to make plays on the ball downfield. He has a massive pair of hands to go with his long arms and is an elite receiver once the ball is in the air. He has the anticipation and jumping ability to high point the ball over nearly any corner he faces. Off the line of scrimmage, he is non-explosive but uses his hands and a subtle jab step to keep defenders at bay. He can work into his route and get back on top of his defender after beating a jam. He will be a prime candidate for back-shoulder fades in the red zone.
-------------------------
Mohamed_Sanu 2533040 83
--NAME-- came in as a heralded recruit, missed only one start at Rutgers and has continued to develop significantly each year. He has good size and is capable of making a lot of plays within a West Coast offense. He is a player who can separate well and excels in the short to intermediate passing game, an ideal receiver for a timing-based, pass-often offense. He is a polished all-around player.
--NAME-- is virtually nonexistent in the deep passing game. He is slow off the line and doesn't have the speed to get behind NFL corners. He can get lazy in and out of his breaks downfield, and he almost loses interest in competing once the route gets deeper than 7 to 10 yards. He is not an explosive athlete with the ball in his hands and simply gets what he can after the catch.
--NAME-- is excellent working drive routes and across the field to read coverages and sit down in the holes of zones. He is a natural at shielding himself from defenders and giving the quarterback a clear throwing lane. He is a reliable hands catcher who is very technical at the top of his routes and when competing with corners to give himself space to secure the catch. --NAME-- is a throwback receiver who sees the ball when going across the middle. He is fearless in all aspects.
-------------------------
Jonathan_Martin 2533041 42
--NAME-- is one of two tackle prospects in this year's class who could be called elite, and given the value of the position will be a likely first-round pick because of it. He embodied all that Stanford football was throughout his time there, as he is an aggressive, smart, technically sound prospect who will enter the league at a stage in his development where he should be able to contribute immediately.
--NAME-- has a tendency to pop upright on contact and get slightly off balance, usually when slanting in the run game. He isn't a real powerful or violent puncher, and at times his punches will slow his feet and he can get caught off guard. He isn't a quick-twitched mover off the snap and could have some issues against the league's best speed rushers.
--NAME-- has prototypical skills for the position. He missed just two games in his career and is extremely tough. He carries his weight well and is one of the most technically sound prospects in the draft. He has a smooth, efficient pass set that allows him to get a solid base and work from a balanced state. He is powerful and aggressive against the run and has good footwork for his size. --NAME-- was the anchor of a very polished offensive line and is simply an NFL-ready tackle.
-------------------------
Riley_Reiff 2533042 23
--NAME-- is an impressive tackle prospect. He started every game in his career and was very durable considering how heavily Iowa relied on its run game. He is a smart player who should be able to adapt to NFL speed and playbooks with ease. Given that he plays at a position with such value, it's unlikely that --NAME-- will last past the first round.
--NAME-- is not the strongest prospect at the position, as he is more of a catch blocker in pass protection and won't have the ability to decleat any ends in the NFL. If any type of foe will give him issues at the next level, it could be heavy 3-4 defensive ends who could blow him back.
--NAME-- is a big body who rolls his hips into his man to tap into his power and explosion. In pass protection he keeps his weight even to have a good anchor and stall bull rushers. --NAME-- has incredible body control and is a true technician working within the box. He uses his hands well, and has the flexibility to play on both sides of the line given his fluid footwork.
-------------------------
David_DeCastro 2533043 24
--NAME-- is an extremely polished guard out of Stanford who started for three consecutive years. While he is considered an early entry junior, he spent four years at Stanford and has already graduated. He is a disciplined and NFL-ready player who likely will warrant a starting spot immediately through his play. He could be one of the highest draft picks at the guard position in recent years, and he could easily go in the top 10.
--NAME-- is inconsistent when finishing run blocks downfield. There were times in 2011 when he would fall off his blocks at times -- although never an effort issue, there are some slight hitches in his bending and footwork downfield that cause him to fall off slightly. He is not a violent puncher with his hands, but he doesn't necessarily need to acquire that trait because he is such a technician.
--NAME-- is a technician on the field and is beautiful to watch for those who respect offensive line play. He is very quick off the ball to get into his block. --NAME-- is able to shuffle nicely to avoid trash when pulling or down blocking. Once engaged, he is very strong to his ground. He demonstrates a good snap upon contact with defenders and is usually the one providing the drive-back pressure on his man. Once locked on his man, he can drive and maneuver them at will using his very strong upper body. --NAME-- is extremely controlled in his movements, and he has body control and overall balance that is rare for a man his size. --NAME-- is very athletic on the move and can key in and adjust well on his moving target. It's nearly impossible to find many weak points in --NAME--'s play throughout college, and he could easily be the best lineman on his team as a rookie.
-------------------------
Brandon_Washington 2533044 200
--NAME-- was part of a mass exodus of juniors at Miami who entered the draft, but he has an edge with four years playing experience since high school after a year in prep school at Milford Academy. He was a consistent, durable starter on the line for Miami in his last two years and didn't miss a game. He held down the left tackle position on a team with very talented linemen. He might need time to develop into a starter, but he has fourth- or fifth-round value. Teams who are willing to let him develop slowly could find value in him as an eventual starter at right tackle.
--NAME-- struggled at times in 2011 in his pass set, where he showed inconsistent footwork and had difficulties getting a good base to anchor himself. He is not very strong in his hands and has difficulties engaging with his man for extended periods of time; he could have trouble blocking within a traditional offense that demands extended protection. His technique will need a lot of work so that he isn't a victim of wasted movements and balance issues.
--NAME-- is a big man who carries a lot of weight in his upper body. He excels as a down blocker on run plays and is comfortable working within a zone scheme to pass off and pick up stunting defensive linemen. He has very good feet for his size, which he showcases when working upfield as a puller. He is an explosive hitter who can uncoil on his man and generate a lot of movement. --NAME-- looks as if he shoots out of his stance at times into his man and would have no problems playing in an up-tempo, no-huddle offense.
-------------------------
Peter_Konz 2533045 55
--NAME-- is the premier center in this year's draft, and his selection will likely be solely based off team needs toward the end of the first round. He has a massive frame for the center position but has impressive knee bend, which allows him to play the position effectively. He made all the calls at the line and was the centerpiece of a dominant Wisconsin line loaded with NFL size and talent.
Even though --NAME-- has good flexibility, defenders will be able to out-leverage him at the point given his size. He can get stunned by quick bull rushes at the point and has a difficult time resetting his feet afterward. While he is an effective short-area mover he looks limited and rigid when moving in space.
--NAME-- looks natural sitting in his stance and swiveling his head to make all the line calls, which is impressive given his uncommon height. He is a smooth athlete who has demonstrated the ability to uncoil his hips into defenders and blow them back to create quick holes in the run game. --NAME-- is a smart player who picks up stunts well and uses his strength and anchor to sit and stall any oncoming bull rushers. He works fluidly with his guards when pulling and sealing. He has all the tools to be an elite center for years to come.
-------------------------
Dwayne_Allen 2533046 64
--NAME-- was a two-year starter at tight end for Clemson, where he won the John Mackey Award (given to the nation's top TE) before declaring early for the draft. The first-team All-ACC selection has great size for the position and even better speed. He is a polished and accomplished route runner who will be an immediate threat at the next level. As a classic, line-attached tight end, --NAME-- can work upfield out of a three-point stance without having to align in the slot. He has a rare combination of size, speed and athleticism, and understands the intricacies of the position.
It's difficult to find many weaknesses in --NAME--'s game, based on the season he had as a junior. But he does labor at times off the ball when blocking in the run game. With a slightly unorthodox stance, he is not nearly as good a blocker as he is a pass-catcher.
--NAME-- is an extremely flexible mover who works in and out of a two-point stance with ease. He has the strength and body control to avoid jams at the line of scrimmage, able to fight through his defender and get into his route. He can drop his weight in and out of breaks and is a very smooth runner for a man his size. Quick to turn his head and locate the ball, --NAME-- excels at shielding off defenders downfield with his body. He can use his explosive athleticism to separate from linebackers and safeties alike. Natural as a short-area receiver, he could become a team's go-to option when it comes to moving the chains.
-------------------------
Orson_Charles 2533047 116
--NAME-- is a big, athletic and flexible tight end. He has decent size and runs pretty well. He was a regular starter the last two years and had over 500 yards receiving as a junior. He is capable of blocking on the line immediately and is a very reliable short-yardage pass-catcher. If he can get a little bigger, he'll be more of a mismatch against linebackers in the short game, and could be drafted as early as the third round.
--NAME-- is a very straight-line runner and could have issues separating from NFL defenders, who will be savvy enough to diagnose his routes. He looks unaware in-phase and is far from being able to set up defenders or get them off-balance. He is flat-footed and has trouble bending to break quickly in his routes. He has decent wiggle and speed after the catch but isn't much of a deep threat and was utilized mostly in the short passing game at Georgia. He beat defenders in college with size and power, but that will be much more difficult to do in the pro game.
--NAME-- is an athletic mover, especially when triggering off the line of scrimmage. He has good power, can fight off hand jabs at the line and is savvy enough to get back to his route. He uses his body well underneath to shield himself from defenders when working against zone coverage and has very reliable hands, which could make him a go-to option on third downs in the NFL. He is still developing as a blocker but has all the physical traits, including strength and a solid frame, to be successful. He is competitive and will likely work hard to hone his skills.
-------------------------
Nick_Perry 2533048 28
Many teams will consider drafting --NAME-- as an outside linebacker in a 3-4. As a sophomore and junior at USC he developed into an elite pass-rushing prospect, and has the size and athletic ability to be successful working against NFL tackles. He has late first-round value.
--NAME-- can get tied up on double teams and has trouble in a tight area. This would bode well for a move to outside backer, where he can rush with more space. It remains to be seen if --NAME-- can cover in the flat. He's a thick player but still a bit of a positional tweener, and doesn't quite have the strength of most defenders his size.
--NAME-- has a very strong base and balance that helps him keep momentum toward the backfield regardless of his initial move. --NAME-- plays with good leverage and surprising athleticism for his size. He has a good burst off the ball and a natural feel for disrupting plays. He chases laterally down the line well and is a sound tackler when he reaches the ball. He has fluid hips and feet in the open field. He will be reliable even as a rookie to set the edge and defend the run with strength.
-------------------------
Whitney_Mercilus 2533049 26
--NAME-- is an early entry junior who started only one year at Illinois. He played the weakside end at Illinois and would be best served there in a 4-3 defense in the NFL. He has third-round value but could ascend.
His feet are slowed by his instincts as he oftentimes gets caught looking into the backfield and hesitates when diagnosing the run. He can get occupied by bigger, stronger blockers and tends to shut it down completely in these looks. He is more quick than explosive. He is a drag-down tackler who relies on his weight and is inconsistent in his wrap-up form.
--NAME-- is a fast, athletic defensive end who is quick off the snap and has a good burst to close on the quarterback. He is a situational rusher who excels against the run and brings the versatility to run to the flats at his size. --NAME-- is able to quickly get off the snap and engage into his man's frame. He excels in pursuit down the line of scrimmage and is a high motor player. He can win at the next level with his speed rush.
-------------------------
Michael_Brockers 2533050 14
--NAME-- is an elite athlete with positional versatility. He came to LSU as a thick linebacker prospect before putting on weight and shifting to the defensive line. Teams that run a 3-4 defense could be interested in playing him as a defensive end, because he is athletic enough to work from the edge in a scheme that requires bigger ends to maintain their blockers and keep the linebackers free. --NAME--, however, has more value as a 3-tech defensive tackle within a 4-3 defense. He will make an immediate impact as a rookie.
--NAME-- has been a starter for just one full year, and is still developing. He has poor pass-rushing technique and relies on his natural ability in many phases of the game. He has a tendency to stand upright, causing him to lose a lot of power. --NAME-- is slow to use his hands to defend against jolt blocks and exposes his frame on most plays. He is a raw player who has grown physically at a rapid pace and is still getting a feel for his body.
--NAME-- has a massive frame and the ability to play a number of different roles depending on the scheme. He can handle double-teams, which he regularly demands, while working inside. He excels against the run and would shore up the middle of a team's defense the second he arrived at camp. With thick, powerful legs, he was able to out-leverage nearly every lineman he faced in the SEC. --NAME-- is able to take advantage of his long arms, and can work off his block toward the ball. He sniffs out plays, possessing an uncanny ability to diagnose screens and draws.
-------------------------
Fletcher_Cox 2533051 12
--NAME-- is an early-entry junior who was a starter for two-and-a-half years at Mississippi State. He is a raw athlete who has room to develop. He has an impressive frame and is one of the more talented athletes at his position in the country. He relies heavily on his natural ability to make splash plays and has major upside.
--NAME-- allows himself to get completely washed away when faced with a double team, a symptom of his rawness. He tries to rely too much on his athleticism when working against the run; he doesn't think to set an anchor and remain a presence and gap-filler within the scheme he plays in. --NAME-- could be a high-risk, high-reward player as a rookie.
--NAME-- is an impressive athlete who is capable of making big plays from the interior of the defensive line. He is extremely fast off the ball and can get into the backfield as quickly as any tackle prospect in the country. He has a high motor and pursues down the line of scrimmage with aggression. He can snap his hips into the offensive line to get a blowback effect; he can also dip and rip his hips around would-be tacklers to get into the backfield. --NAME-- keeps blockers off of him with very active hands. He is a serious athlete who would immediately bolster the front of any defense and would work well in a rotation.
-------------------------
Jerel_Worthy 2533052 51
--NAME-- is an extremely thick, tightly built defensive tackle who displayed a ton of power throughout his career at Michigan State. He chose to forgo his senior year and looks prepared to be an immediate rotational player on the front of a 4-3 scheme. He is capable of playing the nose if necessary but has the athleticism to be a sub-package 3-technique rusher.
--NAME-- gets upright off the snap and really has trouble if he doesn't win with a burst off the snap. He struggles in space and has a difficult time breaking down his weight to fit on a ball carrier. He can get neutralized at times by double teams, not out of a lack of strength or talent, but because of poor effort and a breakdown of technique.
--NAME-- is very thick and powerful throughout his upper body and has thigh power that helps him blow back interior linemen off the snap. He has a surprising burst for a player his size and is capable of knifing and slanting the line to get into the backfield almost instantaneously. He is a leverage-savvy player who understands how to win with either his quickness or bull rush.
-------------------------
Ronnell_Lewis 2533054 125
--NAME-- is an early-entry junior who will likely be moved back to his more natural position of outside linebacker. He played defensive end his last two years, and his frame bodes well for a move. He was a productive player for the Sooners who could even make the extreme jump from end to outside linebacker in a 4-3 scheme, considering that rushing the passer is not a key asset in his arsenal. He has fourth- or fifth-round value and should make early contributions on special teams.
--NAME-- can hesitate at times when reacting to the pass and will struggle early in zone due to poor recognition and hips. He did not get many opportunities to cover downfield in college -- he was tasked more with mauling at the line. He has decent flexibility but struggles to reset his weight after dropping into the flats, and doesn't have the footwork to gather himself when covering running backs. He is a slow-twitched athlete who could struggle working against more explosive players.
--NAME-- is a strong player against the run and can hold the edge well despite often giving up 50 pounds. He has strong arms to shed blocks and is very good defending the run; --NAME-- can engage, read, shed and move toward the ball with ease and has a burst. He has the speed to run down ball carriers to the outside and is a good striker once he gets there. He is a tireless pass rusher who relies more on will than technique. He is active in the box and has some positional versatility.
-------------------------
Terrell_Manning 2533055 163
--NAME-- skipped his senior year at N.C. State after two years as a starter. He had some knee injuries, but was durable enough to not miss significant game time. He has prototypical size for the position in a 4-3 defense, and has displayed the pass rushing skills to potentially put on weight and work that position in a 3-4 scheme. He is a run-first defender and has some slight issues in coverage, so it's likely 3-4 defenses could find more value in his skills as an edge-setter and rusher. He carries fourth-round value because of his competitiveness, demeanor and skill set to be a special teams contributor.
--NAME-- has a decent frame but could have trouble getting the same type of production as an edge rusher at 230 pounds in the NFL. He doesn't show the same burst when chasing down runs to the outside that he does in short areas in the backfield, and he will have trouble keeping faster runners inside. He is only average in both zone and man coverage, and often looks stiff in his hips.
--NAME-- reads and works off the movements of offensive linemen well. He excels as a run defender where he has the strength hold his ground and keep plays inside of him, or rework back out to run down ball carriers. He takes on blocks well and shows obvious strength when shedding them. He is aware of his size and keeps himself clean of blocks consistently, and is a physical player who can maul tight ends when aligned over them to disrupt their timing. He has a good short area burst to close on the ball and displays the body control to keep his feet churning. He is productive in the backfield, with four sacks and 12 tackles for loss in 2011.
-------------------------
Luke_Kuechly 2533056 9
--NAME-- had one of the most productive careers, in terms of tackles, in recent memory for a collegiate linebacker. Twelve tackles for loss is a testament to his overall ability and instincts to get in the backfield. He is more of an athlete than given credit for and has simply been a machine throughout his college career. --NAME-- has all the tools to be an immediate starter in the NFL and shore up the middle of a defense.
The major knock on --NAME-- is that he had a lot of  "inflated" tackle production in college: i.e., most of his tackles came five-to-eight yards downfield. He didn't get up into the line of scrimmage to make powerful, impactful plays much, and won't be relied upon as a pass rusher at the next level, where he'll be strictly a tackling, sideline-to-sideline backer.
--NAME-- is one of the most instinctual and technically sound linebackers to enter the draft in years, and he had the tackle production throughout his career to back it up. He is able to avoid trash at his knees and is elite when it comes to shedding blockers and keeping himself free to the ball. He is excellent working over the top of tight ends to maul and delay their release, and is capable of running with them down the field. He has the sudden burst and long speed to cover a very wide range against the run and is an extremely sure-handed tackler.
-------------------------
Dont'a_Hightower 2533057 25
Alabama has developed some impressive inside linebackers in the past couple years, and --NAME-- is a shining example of the type of NFL-ready players in the stable that allows the Crimson Tide to be so successful at the collegiate level. --NAME-- has looked the part of a starting middle linebacker in the NFL for two years. If he can keep his weight steady and not lose any speed, --NAME-- can do many of the same things that Oakland's Rolando McClain or New England's Brandon Spikes did working as the physical inside presence of a defense. --NAME-- could be a better fit within a 3-4 scheme, as he has the size to shed big offensive linemen who would work free to block him in the run game.
--NAME-- has a big frame and can labor at times to move in extended spaces on the field. He excels within the box but likely won't run down many scatbacks at the next level. He is good to defend the pass in zone but struggles to maintain coverage in man after trying to disrupt at the line. --NAME-- struggles to flip his hips in man looks, and there are times when he has to change direction unexpectedly. He isn't heavy-footed, but he pursues the ball with a lot of momentum and can overshoot plays at times.
--NAME-- is lengthy and imposing in the middle of a defense. He has long arms that he uses effectively to fight off blockers, dip and push to avoid trash at his feet, and keep balls close to him. He is not the most athletic player in space, but he uses his arms to tie up receivers within his zone and fight tight ends off the ball. He is technically sound, although his style of play looks effortless. There are not many wasted motions in his movements, and he takes good angles to the ball when working both sides of the field. Although --NAME-- doesn't quite possess the speed to be a true sideline-to-sideline inside linebacker or the sole tackler in the middle of a 3-4 defense, he uses his instincts well and remains in position.
-------------------------
Morris_Claiborne 2533059 6
The winner of the Jim Thorpe Award (given to the country's top defensive back) opted to forgo his senior year and enter the draft. He is huge for the position and has great speed. A very explosive athlete, --NAME-- should easily press for a starting role wherever he lands. He covered top-tier talent in the SEC and is as polished as corners come. He has first-round value and shouldn't last long in the draft.
--NAME-- can sometimes be lazy with his technique. Working in off-man coverage, he has a tendency to get his pad level high in his backpedal, diluting the explosiveness that makes him so effective out of his breaks.
--NAME-- is an aggressive cover man who likes to use his tall frame and long arms to get in receivers' faces, shock them at the line of scrimmage and disrupt their timing. When he punches, he makes his presence felt. He can run with his back to the ball at the receiver's hip using a press/bail technique and looks natural running with his man in-phase while still keeping an eye on the ball. --NAME-- is such a gifted athlete with uncommon body control that he runs with his man fluidly up and down the field and still be able to break off at any time and get involved in plays coming across him. As a zone defender, he is simply an explosive athlete with length and can keep plays in front of him and react quick enough to meet the man at the ball. He is physical in run support and will have no problem coming up to tackle from the edge.
-------------------------
Dre_Kirkpatrick 2533060 17
--NAME-- is an early-entry junior who started for three years in Alabama. He is a very lengthy corner. --NAME-- could also be moved and developed at safety, where some teams might see his length and ability to play in zone more transferable, and he wouldn't be a tackling liability despite his thin frame.
--NAME-- has issues that surround all aspects of his prospects and overall value as he enters the draft. He is very thin and some will question his ability to play physically at the next level. Although he has always been advertised as a cornerback, his size and athletic ability could encourage a transition to safety. It remains to be seen if --NAME-- can add weight to compete at that position after three years at Alabama where his physical development was minimal.
Athletes like --NAME-- are able to defy the perception that taller skill players don't have the footwork and agility that shorter players do. --NAME-- will thrive initially within a zone scheme, where he can use his burst and length to cover ground and remain active. He is so talented athletically that he could likely be tested early on an island in man coverage and excel, and he possesses the confidence and field presence necessary to take on such a task.
-------------------------
Jayron_Hosley 2533061 94
--NAME-- is an early entry junior who was a very productive corner for Virginia Tech throughout his career. He is undersized but plays with tenacity and a sense of urgency when around the ball. --NAME-- is an extremely scrappy player who finds a way to make an impact from the boundary corner position. He could be a late riser in the draft and needs to prove that he can add weight to his frame to compete with NFL size, but he has late first-round value and should find playing time in nickel packages right away.
--NAME-- is very thin and could get abused by the likes of Larry Fitzgerald and other big receivers. He has unconventional footwork that could get him in trouble against quicker athletes. He can get lost at times when working with his back toward the ball and needs to be placed within the right scheme to be an effective player.
--NAME-- is an excellent zone corner who has a ton of range and playmaking ability around the ball. He has good field awareness to sniff out receiver screens and is quick reacting when the ball is thrown. He is consistently involved in the play and has good length to disengage receivers from the ball. --NAME-- is deceptive as a hitter and can deliver a serious blow for having such a small frame. He has an impressive bubble and is a very bouncy athlete who can change directions on a dime. He is capable of smothering at the line using his hands and technique, and can stay in a receiver's hip in-phase. He is a scrappy player who employs an unconventional shuffle step and technique in general, but he finds a way to make impact plays.
-------------------------
Stephon_Gilmore 2533062 10
--NAME-- is a dynamic athlete who made a lot of plays at corner for South Carolina. He has the skill set to move to safety but is talented enough to challenge for a starting role at the corner position as a rookie. He makes big plays and was one of the SEC's finest athletes.
--NAME-- loses a lot of his fluidity when working in zone or off-man, and his eyes slow his feet in that he doesn't diagnose routes as quickly and will get his feet stuck in the ground prior to breaking. --NAME-- was able to rely on size, strength and athleticism to cover in college, but he will be exposed by the technically sound veteran receivers in the league. He will struggle when forced to work within specific schemes that don't allow him to play freely.
--NAME-- has impressive footwork for his size, which he uses well in a shuffle-shuffle-bail technique at the line of scrimmage. Although this isn't considered the most efficient technique, --NAME-- makes it work, allowing him to use his huge frame to mirror and cut off receivers early in their routes. He is a natural cover man who can jam at the line and stay with a receiver in his hip and use his strength and length to make plays on the ball and finish plays.
-------------------------
Matt_Kalil 2533131 4
--NAME-- is the undisputed top tackle prospect in this year's draft after two successful years starting on the left side for USC. He is an early-entry junior who has been a reliable blindside protector for --NAME-- Barkley. He has all the physical tools to achieve success at the next level and has continued to develop his game technically. --NAME-- has an NFL pedigree, as his dad was a former semi-professional player and his older brother Ryan is a consistent Pro Bowl center for the Carolina Panthers. He should be the first lineman off the board and could easily be a top-five pick and immediately hold down the starting left tackle position for an NFL team.
There are some concerns surrounding --NAME--'s ability to anchor and stall bull rushers, given his tendency to play upright. There were few examples of his anchor actually being an issue in college, but the limited level of knee bend he plays with could be a concern. He rarely snaps his hips through when blocking in the run game and is more of a mirror/positional blocker. He could have to work on his knee bend and flexibility to take on the more explosive ends in the NFL.
--NAME-- is tall and has an impressive frame that he carries well. He is equally thick and strong from his upper body down through his thighs, and he has thin calves and ankles that lend well to him being a light-footed mover. He explodes off the ball every snap and gets to his destination point with ease. In the run game, he can provide a punishing first blow to keep his man off balance, and is very comfortable getting to the second level to fit on backers. He has a technically sound kick step in pass protection and slides very smoothly. He is NFL-ready in terms of using his hands and has the ability to decleat defensive ends.
-------------------------
Ron_Brooks 2533332 124
--NAME-- is an undersized corner who never became a starter while playing in a stacked defensive backfield at LSU. However, after spending a year as a redshirt freshman, he became an influential member of the defense. --NAME-- was a consummate playmaker from the nickel position, and would be attractive to teams looking for an athletic, experienced defensive back who can cover out of the slot and blitz in a zone. He isn't the most physical tackler, but he is explosive and effective rushing from the edge in all-out blitz looks. After working with top-tier talents like Patrick Peterson and Morris Claiborne, --NAME-- should be ready to compete in the NFL. He will likely be drafted in one of the later rounds.
--NAME-- is a bit undersized and has very little experience as a starter, and can look lost at times. He does well when the action is directly in front of him or when he's in the gunner position, but has trouble diagnosing plays or sticking with a quick-twitch receiver.
--NAME-- is athletic, knows how to cover receivers out of the slot and takes full advantage of his hip mobility and flexibility. He is a quick-twitch athlete with noticeable explosiveness. He is effective in coverage and can blitz when given the chance to rush full-speed from the edge. He can make plays all over the field, whether as a nickel corner, an offbeat edge rusher, or a gunner/cover man on special teams.
-------------------------
Greg_Childs 2533334 134
--NAME-- was inconsistent at Arkansas but showed enough that he should be a late-round pick. He was obviously uncomfortable when running routes in 2011 after suffering a torn patella tendon the previous season.
--NAME--' lack of speed is obvious on routes deeper than five to 10 yards. He is not explosive and struggles to separate from receivers, though the ability to separate is becoming increasingly important in the NFL. He is not a deep threat and makes all downfield plays solely because of his size. --NAME-- is just an average athlete who will struggle to make an immediate impact at the next level.
--NAME-- understands how to use his body in the short game to create the space needed to be effective. He builds up his speed throughout the route and can battle with corners underneath when trying to gain position on slant and drive routes. He isn't a physical player, but he will use his big frame to shield when necessary. When running the fade route, he understands how to use the sideline to his advantage. He can make any catch and can torque his body when running in-phase.
-------------------------
Caleb_McSurdy 2533337 222
--NAME-- was a force in the Big Sky Conference in his senior year, recording 114 tackles and 7.5 tackles for loss. He is a thick, short inside linebacker who doesn't have great speed but should be able to use his strength, instincts and tackling ability to find playing time early and often at the next level. He could be selected in the late rounds to a team seeking linebacker depth.
--NAME-- is a bit undersized for the inside linebacker position. Given his inexperience with top-line collegiate play, he could struggle against bigger offensive linemen working toward the second level in the NFL. He struggles against tight ends.
--NAME-- is a very instinctual linebacker who relies on his play recognition and pre-snap keys to put himself in a strong position to make plays. He is a quick-twitched mover once the ball is snapped and easily sniffs out run plays. He is a solid, reliable wrap-up tackler on the inside and shows a polished ability to dip his hips, fend off a low block and make a quick move towards the ball.
-------------------------
J_R_Sweezy 2533342 225
--NAME--'s versatility is the key to his draft value. He could play a three-technique defensive tackle within a 4-3 scheme, but by the time draft day rolls around, he could have already convinced a 3-4 team to take a shot on him as a defensive end. Consider him a poor man's --NAME--.--NAME--. Watt of the Houston Texans; he has the type of competitiveness to compete for early playing time. As a defensive end in a 3-4, he could be drafted in the late rounds, but he will make a strong case for a spot on a 53-man roster no matter what his position.
--NAME-- is a stiff mover and could have trouble trying to play inside in the NFL. In a 3-4 scheme, he could be more of a gap-filler, which is where he has the most value. He struggles to get off blocks inside and make anything for himself. He is more of a motor player than a natural athlete, and this could be exposed early in his career.
--NAME-- is a decent athlete but is somewhat stiff in his movements. He has good initial quickness off the ball and generally is able to read blocking schemes and disrupt plays. He is an effort player, and this is the key to his sideline-to-sideline success. He even could be a candidate to get down in a three-point stance and hand-fight with faster players.
-------------------------
Winston_Guy 2533345 181
--NAME-- is a big safety from Kentucky who, not unlike last year's draft gem Randall Cobb on the offensive side, was a jack of all trades for Kentucky throughout his career. He played corner as a freshman before moving to safety for his second and third years, and ultimately ended up at outside linebacker. Projects as a safety in the NFL and can contribute early on special teams, giving him late-round value.
As a safety, --NAME-- will struggle early in zone coverage and recovering on deep balls. After playing the last year of his college career in the box as a linebacker, there will be obvious hitches in his technique and transition when aligning 10 to 15 yards deep as a safety. He lacks instincts when playing the pass and has trouble recognizing when a ball is thrown and triggering his feet to get there.
--NAME-- is an excellent player in run support, makes a lot of plays off the edge and could be an effective sub-package zone blitzer in his pro career. He is a drag-down tackler, but is usually in position and good with pre-snap reads. Seems to have the savvy and athletic ability to start at various positions.
-------------------------
Bradie_Ewing 2533347 157
--NAME-- is the beneficiary of a thin fullback crop this year, although there's growing sentiment that the position is being eliminated from NFL offenses. A throwback player -- a block first guy who will need to be selected by an offense that intends to use him that way, and as a special teams contributor. --NAME-- came into Wisconsin as a running back and was the Badgers' special teams player of the year as a senior.
--NAME-- is not going to make any electric plays with the ball at the next level. He has the ability to block with the same tenacity as many fullbacks who have been successful of late in the NFL, such as Vonta Leach of the Baltimore Ravens. --NAME-- is a decent athlete but very stiff and straight-line as a runner.
--NAME-- is a powerful blocker who hits the hole hard and can dip, sit and uncoil his hips for an explosive block into a linebacker. He had few carries and catches in his career, but he was reliable when thrown to. Though he can be explosive when opening holes for running backs, he is more of a seek-out, engage and stalemate blocker. He is quick off the snap for his size, and it's obvious he understands how to maximize his opportunities. Took a backseat in his senior year due to the rise of quarterback Russell Wilson. He is an NFL-ready player who has played in Wisconsin's professional blocking schemes for years.
-------------------------
Andrew_Tiller 2533351 179
--NAME-- has NFL size for the guard position. He is a below-average athlete, which hurts his ability to contribute early at the next level. A strong, positional blocker who really excels in the run game, --NAME-- can overpower his defender with ease. His footwork is his Achilles heel and the reason he could be relegated to the practice squad during his first few years.
--NAME-- is a interior lineman who lacks explosion and struggles in pass protection. It seems he hasn't honed in on a stance and pass-set that he feels comfortable with, as he gets too high at times and can be caught off-balance by powerful pass rushers. He struggles in space to work upfield and get his hands on linebackers, and really would excel more in a zone blocking scheme.
--NAME-- makes his mark as a run blocker. Although not very explosive, he is generally able to move defensive linemen out of the play if he can get his hands on them. Size and strength are the shining attributes of his game.
-------------------------
Akiem_Hicks 2533433 89
--NAME-- is an interesting late-riser prospect coming into the draft following a career playing college football in Canada, at the little-known University of Regina in Saskatchewan. He started at LSU, but circumstances surrounding his recruitment led him north of the border. He has the size to play on the front lines and could have late-round value for a team willing to develop him.
--NAME-- has been a slow developer who has played two full seasons of junior college ball (Sacramento City College) and then two seasons in Canada. It remains to be seen how readily adaptable his skills are to the pros given that level of competition. While teams might want him as an end based off his size, --NAME-- can get overwhelmed at the point of attack against double teams, and he doesn't have many moves in his arsenal to counter. He is a decent run defender, but plays too upright at times; technique is the main hitch in every aspect of his game.
--NAME-- has a promising frame, not only to play at defensive tackle but also outside at end in a 3-4 scheme. He is athletic and shows a strong burst and agility off the snap to get into opposing offensive linemen. He has decent strength to defeat blockers, but he prefers to make an athletic move and quickly get into the backfield. He is athletic in open space, and this is where his value is most evident. He has NFL-caliber size, agility and burst off the ball.
-------------------------
Dontari_Poe 2533435 11
--NAME-- is a big man who will likely improve a 3-4 defense working as its anchor inside at NT. His best attribute is his ability to occupy space inside and allow those on the second level to flow and make plays. He can use his strength to overpower most blockers and use his athletic ability to be a threat making plays around the ball. --NAME-- has the build and athleticism to be picked late in the first round.
--NAME-- can't do much else besides be an effective lane-clogger within the right scheme. He doesn't have the versatility to move outside to end in a 3-4, a trend that has been seen from many teams who like to get girth and athleticism on the edge of their line. He is not very quick off the ball, and although he is a good athlete for his size, he could struggle to create "splash" plays for himself early on at the next level, where he will likely be facing double teams and much stronger interior lineman.
Strong lower body so that he can stabilize his position. His athletic ability and quickness force the use of a double team, and he can wreak havoc around the ball. --NAME-- uses his strong hands to keep defenders at bay and throw them around to create opportunities. He is a consistent defender who combines size, strength, athletic ability, and understanding.
-------------------------
Brock_Osweiler 2533436 57
--NAME-- is an intriguing early-entry prospect out of Arizona State. A good athlete for the position, --NAME-- was originally signed to play basketball at Gonzaga before opting to play football at ASU. He has the arm strength to be a first-day pick but hasn't shown the consistency that is characteristic of guys who deserve first-round money.
--NAME-- had on-the-field judgment issues and isn't reliable to protect the ball from turnovers. It seems as if he starts to get rolling in a game, and the more confidence he builds, the more of a gunslinger mentality he adopts. This severely hinders his play. When under control, early in the game, he is athletic, accurate, and a good game manager. He is likely a developmental prospect who could struggle if forced to play early.
--NAME-- has a very deliberate, quick-twitched setup. He slings the ball naturally, and even though he pats the ball before throwing, his release is so compact and effective he isn't hindered. His shining asset is his arm strength; he can hit nearly any NFL-caliber throw at this point in his career. He is a good leader and looks in control in the huddle and on the field. He has the pocket presence of a first-day pick and doesn't go down easily.
-------------------------
Ronnie_Hillman 2533437 67
--NAME-- is an early entry junior to the draft from San Diego State, where he started every game for the Aztecs in the past two years and was first team All-Mountain West. He is a bit undersized but has the speed and quickness to have an immediate impact in the NFL. He likely won't demand the bulk of the carries for an NFL team but is a good "change of pace" guy who does a lot of things well enough to project to make an impact.
--NAME-- is a very smooth mover but is not very explosive with the ball in his hands. He likes to feel his way through the line of scrimmage and usually gets to the second level with ease, but he struggles to run with power or elusiveness to make defenders miss and really break for a big gain. He averaged 5.5 yards per carry in his senior year, but those numbers were a bit skewed thanks to some long runs.
--NAME-- relies heavily on his quickness and immediate vision to find a seam to be an effective runner. He has decent speed for his size, but his quickness is his biggest asset. He has a natural feel for how to find daylight and can be patient to wait for a pulling interior lineman to get to the second level. He has a good burst in a short area to make guys miss, and has the quickness to be an effective short-yardage back in the NFL.
-------------------------
Justin_Anderson 2533441 208
--NAME-- was rightfully given one of Georgia's "Most Improved Player" awards as a senior. He has the frame to be a starting tackle in the NFL, and has steadily developed the skills to match. Given a medical redshirt in 2010, --NAME-- didn't become a full-time starter until last season and looked unsure of himself at times early on. He has the talent to be taken in one of the later rounds by a team seeking depth on the offensive line.
--NAME-- is still developing. He recovered well from injury as a senior, but had faced durability concerns until then. After spending a year at the heralded Hargrave Military Academy, it took him some time to come into his own and develop the footwork and coordination necessary to be effective in the SEC. He will battle weight issues, and pro teams will need to know he can stay active and healthy for the long-term.
--NAME-- has very good size for a tackle. He has developed his footwork, has a functional pass set and can anchor himself and mirror, a technique he employs regularly. He is naturally a strong player who can move defenders in the run game and can use his feet to mirror and shade. He knows how to use his big frame to his advantage.
-------------------------
Kelvin_Beachum 2533442 248
--NAME-- was a redshirt freshman but started every game throughout the rest of his time at SMU. He is undersized compared to most professional offensive tackles, but improved steadily in college, displaying the kind of athletic ability, body control and footwork that will make him a late-round draft pick. --NAME-- has significant strength deficiencies; his ability to physically develop as a rookie will likely determine whether he'll have a future in the NFL.
--NAME-- is a soft prospect. He comes off the ball and moves quickly, but he is not explosive and has a hard time generating push on his man off the snap. He struggles in the run-blocking game, which doesn't bode well for his development and projected move inside to guard. SMU's style didn't offer many chances to show that he can perform in a classic run-blocking scheme, and NFL teams will have to guess whether he can successfully make that positional shift. --NAME-- is a mirror and patty-cake blocker who was effective and productive at SMU; whether his skills transfer to the NFL is another question.
--NAME-- is very quick off the ball and plays with an obvious sense of urgency. He has a good first step that allows him to get out in front and gain position. When working upfield, he has very impressive short-area quickness and footwork. He is able to adjust against moving linebackers, and he did well in the limited time he spent working in space. --NAME-- shows smooth, controlled lateral agility when engaging his pass set.
-------------------------
Randy_Bullock 2533444 161
--NAME-- was a reliable placekicker for Texas A&M, claiming the position halfway through his freshman year and holding it down ever since. --NAME-- attempted 101 extra points over the past two years, making every one. He is also an accomplished kickoff specialist.
--NAME-- could be a liability as a safety tackler. He didn't get in on much action of that sort in college and likely won't be able to run down any returners in the NFL. He should also refine his technique so that he can generate a bit more rise on his kicks.
--NAME-- is accurate from both short and long distances, and is capable of kicking consistent touchbacks in the NFL. He made over 87 percent of his field goal attempts during his senior year, an impressive statistic, considering he attempted more than two per game. He takes a consistent, controlled approach to each kick, getting enough rise to avoid blocks.
-------------------------
Drake_Dunsmore 2533448 233
--NAME-- is an intriguing offensive weapon from Northwestern, a college tight end who shows the frame and skill set to be used in a variety of ways at the next level. Much like Chris Cooley in Washington, or Aaron Hernandez this year in New England, --NAME-- has the ability to be a threat from various spots on the field and be a reliable short-yardage option to pick up first downs and create mismatches.
--NAME-- is not a very powerful runner after the catch. He can do just enough with the ball in his hands to be reliable, but he shouldn't be a deep-play option in the offense. He is limited as a run blocker and, although he fits the build to play special teams, he hasn't shown much there throughout his career. He simply might not be enough of an athlete to create true mismatches at the next level the way he did at Northwestern.
--NAME-- has good size to work out of the slot and the backfield. He has decent speed. He isn't much of a mismatch against linebackers, but he has the uncanny ability to separate from defenders and secure a catch. He is a good route runner in the short-to-intermediate game, where he knows how to throttle it down and exploit the zone of a defense or box out a defender and use his frame to get just enough space to secure a catch. He is a decent upfield runner who has just enough power and shake to make a man miss or carry a pile for a first down. He is a technical route runner who uses all he has to simply get open every time he is targeted with the ball.
-------------------------
Adam_Gettis 2533449 141
--NAME-- started full-time for only one year at Iowa after logging just three starts prior to his senior year. He is a severely undersized yet smart and competitive blocker who stood out this year for Iowa as the leader of the line. It will be much more difficult for him to overcome his size deficiencies at the next level; if he can't put on at least 10 to 15 pounds of weight, he could struggle against the league's top interior defensive linemen.
--NAME-- is very undersized, and this will force many teams to do a cross-examination of his play. Although he is a big-time player on film, some teams could have issues with drafting a lineman who is well under the average size in the NFL, where in 2011 the average was just more than 300 pounds. Aside from size, --NAME-- doesn't generate much of a push off the ball into his man and relies heavily on footwork to make effective blocks.
--NAME-- is quick off the ball and uses his initial explosion as a tactic to overcome size deficiencies. He consistently gets into his man first when pass blocking and is a good overall blocker because of it. He wins with leverage, which is often the only way to gain an advantage on bigger foes. --NAME-- is very polished in his footwork, and he understands pad and helmet placement's importance in gaining a blocking advantage. His quick feet allow him to be a very mobile and versatile blocker.
-------------------------
Lamar_Holmes 2533450 91
--NAME-- is a massive offensive tackle from Southern Miss who carries his 320 pounds well and is a deceptive athlete. He continued to improve his technique throughout his career and looked like an NFL player in his senior year. He has good natural strength and could be selected in the later rounds.
--NAME-- has a bad habit of stopping his feet on contact, which works in pass protection but leaves him vulnerable when pulling or blocking against the run. His feet don't coincide with his hands when engaged on a block, and he will need to learn to eat up grass in the run game or he will get plays blown up at his expense at the next level.
--NAME-- has good natural strength and an anchor to stall bull rushers at the point of attack. He has an evenly proportioned body throughout his 6-foot-6 frame and looks the part of a starting NFL tackle. He doesn't have a lot of range in his pass set, but he generally gets good enough position to sustain his man. He can move his feet fairly well for his size and mirror with quicker rushers.
-------------------------
John_Hughes 2533451 87
--NAME-- is a fifth-year senior from Cincinnati who started for two years at defensive tackle. He has the size to compete inside at the next level, but he lacks athletic ability and has been rather unproductive to this point in his career. He could get selected in a later round by a team that falls in love with him, but he is more likely to get a shot as a free agent. The pre-draft process will be of extra importance for --NAME--, as he needs to prove he has the skills to match his frame.
--NAME-- has numerous issues in his play that, if not fixed early, could severely limit his NFL prospects. He seems lazy at times and rarely chases plays down on the perimeter. As a run defender, he is capable of getting through blocks but often looks shell-shocked once he gets in the backfield. He needs to finish with more force; at times --NAME-- would be neutralized by offensive linemen because of his poor effort and pad placement.
--NAME-- is a big man who until his senior year had mostly been a gap-filler. He uses his hands well to stay off blocks and displays good technique. He can defeat single blocks fairly easily and plays with good instincts. It's obvious that he is diagnosing plays early after recognizing blocking schemes.
-------------------------
Cam_Johnson 2533452 237
--NAME-- played his first two years at outside linebacker at Virginia before moving to end, although his current size doesn't necessarily suggest positional versatility at the next level. He has solidified himself as an end in a 4-3 scheme since he excels at many things that coaches utilizing 9-technique players desire at the position.
The scouting report on --NAME-- will recommend getting an extra hand or body on him at all times to completely neutralize him. At Virginia, he struggled against double teams. The problem usually stemmed from his effort, considering he displays the strength and technique to elude blocks when facing a single blocker. He will give up at times if he notices an extra blocker near him. He will need to learn how to bring it on every down in the NFL.
--NAME-- is a good athlete who moves well for an end his size. He has the foot quickness and explosive first step to keep offensive tackles off balance, and the body control to work his moves and not be thrown off track by linemen. He is a classic 4-3 defensive end who excels at rushing the passer. He is a face-up tackler who can fill his lane in run support, despite the inclination to rush the passer every down. He uses his hands actively when rushing the passer and playing against the run, and he gives good effort in pursuit on the backside. He is strong enough to hold the edge for his linebackers to flow to their gaps.
-------------------------
Jonathan_Massaquoi 2533455 164
--NAME-- was the preseason Sun Belt Conference Defensive Player of the Year, but stopped collecting awards and accolades after that. He put an "above average" season on film and is a middle- or late-round prospect. He is hurt by the fact that he is such a tweener, playing defensive end in college at 250 pounds without showing the athletic ability that would intrigue a 3-4 team to move him to outside linebacker. --NAME--'s stock will depend on his pre-draft workout numbers. He could go fourth round or higher.
Massaquoui is a stiff, elongated defender who struggles to move fluidly in space. Off the snap, he doesn't have the innate burst or speed to get outside of offensive tackles using a speed rush. Although his bull rush was effective in college, he doesn't have the natural strength to use power moves and win at the next level. --NAME-- looks unnatural in a three-point stance, an alignment that really illuminates his stiffness.
--NAME-- has very long arms, which are a major source of intrigue to NFL talent evaluators. --NAME-- would benefit from staying at end where he can use his arms in tight quarters to keep an advantage on offensive tackles. If he is moved to linebacker, --NAME-- has shown the ability to cover in short areas and fly out to cover the flats and running backs out of the backfield.
-------------------------
Alfred_Morris 2533457 173
--NAME-- is a thick running back and a bit of a tweener, not big enough to be imposing at the next level. He is a serviceable runner who at best could carry a load like BenJarvus Green-Ellis of New England, but he will have to prove he has the speed and athleticism to deserve a shot. He carries late-round or free-agent value.
--NAME-- doesn't have NFL speed and will need to define himself more as a runner if he wants to make enough of an impression in a camp. He has the natural ability within the tackles to be successful, but in the NFL seams and holes are harder to come by and arm tackles difficult to avoid. --NAME-- will need to prove himself as a thumper early.
--NAME-- is a natural runner between the tackles. He is deceptively agile in short areas to avoid clean hits, and plays faster when tasked with finding daylight in a short area. He has a sense of urgency in the backfield. He is capable of blocking in pass protection at the next level.
-------------------------
Nathan_Stupar 2533459 230
--NAME-- started sparingly throughout his career at Penn State but was active and productive when he did get playing time. He emerged as one of the leaders on a strong Nittany Lions defense in 2011. Like many Penn State linebackers, --NAME-- is a competitive, technically sound player who should be able to contribute early in some capacity for an NFL team. He will be a strong special teams candidate and could push to make a roster as a backup.
--NAME-- is undersized for an outside linebacker and can get engulfed by linemen at the second level and stonewalled at the point of attack. He will have a difficult time shedding blocks in the NFL and has limited starting experience at the position. He has a tendency to overpursue, and at times can take poor angles to the ball. --NAME-- still looked like he was adapting to the position in his senior year.
--NAME-- has a high football IQ that is evident both before the snap and throughout run plays. He can diagnose plays early and fill his gap with good overall athleticism. He has deceptive speed and can meet ball carriers at the edge. He has extensive special teams experience, which will earn him looks as he tries to make a team. He comes from an NFL pedigree and wouldn't look out of place in a pro locker room this year. He has value as a pass rusher and can work within a zone scheme.
-------------------------
Robert_Turbin 2533460 106
--NAME-- has been a productive back at Utah State, consistently rushing for more than 100 yards per game. He remains a bit of an unknown, but he should excite leading up to the draft with his athletic ability and size. He could be picked as early as the second round.
The only unappealing aspect of --NAME--'s game is his pass blocking. --NAME-- whiffed on blockers at times while at Utah State. The problem is his technique; he tends to get off-balance and then is blown back into the passer. Cut blocks were an issue for him as well.
--NAME-- is very athletic. He has the size to be a thumper inside, but he moves more like a shifty third-down back. He has very quick feet and can instantaneously stop and start when coming out of the backfield. He has a big frame that quickly reaches full speed. A classic downhill runner who can run through linebackers and carry the pile, he also was a threat throughout his career in the pass game. He has the durability to wear down an NFL defense for an entire game.
-------------------------
Chris_Givens 2533532 96
--NAME-- is an early entry junior out of Wake Forest, where he was a first-team All-ACC selection this past year. He has adequate size and is a blazing straight-line runner who looks similar to Philadelphia's Jeremy Maclin with his movements in-route. He relies heavily on his speed in everything he does. He's capable of taking a speed-out and cutting upfield to daylight. He is a polished player who could be selected late in the first round; he has all the traits of a productive NFL receiver and an immediate Number 2 option.
--NAME-- can get jammed at the line of scrimmage when he doesn't ignite a quick jab step or if an explosive corner quickly gets in his face. He often looks over his shoulder and gets alligator arms going across the middle. He is a tough player but far from physical. --NAME-- gives little effort as a blocker in the run game and is only capable of being a decoy or running off his man.
--NAME-- is an elite deep-threat receiver who is fluid and quick off the ball. He can eat up a defensive back's cushion in a few steps to get them on their heels and then accelerate in a very controlled, explosive motion. He adjusts well to balls in front or behind him, and he can make all the necessary catches at full speed. --NAME-- has obvious field awareness and routinely would get behind corners in Cover 2 before throttling down for a quick back-shoulder throw before a safety can get there. He can get jammed at the line on occasion but usually beats defenders with a jab step. He has excellent footwork at full speed to change directions or drag his feet along the sideline.
-------------------------
Rueben_Randle 2533533 63
--NAME-- is an early-entry junior who has become a late riser in this year's class. He was limited by inconsistent LSU quarterback play all year. He is an impressive athlete.
--NAME-- is still developing many of his skills and will be more of a prospect. He still looked uncomfortable running some routes and isn't to a point where he is actively thinking about how to sell his corner on every play. He will take his eye off the ball across the middle and is inconsistent with his physicality.
--NAME-- is a tall receiver who displays good balance throughout his route and leans on his defender well to create separation. He is learning how to work routes downfield and is a strong catcher of both high and low balls. He has good flexibility and really came along as a junior with his overall field awareness and ability to diagnose coverages to find his spots in zones.
-------------------------
Olivier_Vernon 2533534 72
--NAME-- entered the draft after a disappointing year in which he only started three games after slowly coming back from an NCAA suspension. He is an undersized defensive end who likely will be moved to outside linebacker in a 3-4 defense, where he has much more value. He excels as an edge rusher and has a serious opportunity to boost his second-round value because he has so much to offer.
--NAME-- is limited simply by his inexperience. He hasn't had many opportunities to cover in man schemes and really struggled the few times he was asked to blanket faster players.
--NAME-- is a strong and powerful athlete who gets good leverage to set the edge. He is solid against the run and can play from different alignments. He also is a very competitive player who is capable of working sideline to sideline.
-------------------------
Stephen_Hill 2533537 43
--NAME-- is an early entry junior receiver out of Georgia Tech who started consistently for the past two years and was the sole deep threat in a run-first offense. He has great length and an outstanding catch radius, which along with his speed make him a serious deep-threat option in the NFL. He has a thin frame and will be hurt by the fact that he ran a very basic route tree at Georgia Tech, and teams won't be able to utilize him for much more than go routes at this point in his career. He is a splash player who was Number 1 in the nation in yards per catch; he has fourth-round value based off his all-around body of work but could impress a team with his size and speed enough to ascend significantly throughout the pre-draft process. If the rest of his game can catch up to the ability he shows in the deep passing game, --NAME-- could be the sleeper of this year's draft.
--NAME--'s value is based purely off his ability as a deep threat. He has average quickness and moves off the line of scrimmage to avoid a jam. He ran a very basic route tree at Georgia Tech that didn't allow him to showcase many skills. Outside of catching jump balls, he struggles to read coverages and understand how to find holes in a zone. --NAME-- looks uncomfortable with the ball in his hands and resembles a lengthy track star on the field instead of a football player. He dropped as many big balls as he made big plays; his YPC stat defines him perfectly as a player who is capable of making flash plays but isn't reliable.
--NAME-- will be a legitimate deep threat at the next level -- by recording nearly 30 yards per catch as a senior, he showed he was capable of going deep and scoring on every play. He consistently runs past corners on deep routes and is impressive at the point of the catch, as he is able to lay out for the ball or rise above his defender. --NAME-- is a very good blocker who uses his length well and surprisingly doesn't get off-balance often, something that is usually evident of players with his frame. Though it's risky to throw early comparisons of Hall-of-Fame-caliber players on prospects that don't even garner first-round consideration, --NAME-- could remind some of Randy Moss when it comes to running a pure, one-on-one deep route.
-------------------------
Chandler_Jones 2533538 21
--NAME-- is an underclassman defensive end who has displayed good size and speed throughout his career at Syracuse. He suffered a knee injury that severely limited him in 2011 and will need to prove he's fully recovered throughout the pre-draft process to warrant the draft consideration that he's shown he's worthy of on the field. He should be selected somewhere in the third round. Though undersized, he is best served playing the end position in a 4-3 scheme.
--NAME-- is undersized and could have issues against stronger offensive tackles. He is a long strider who takes too many steps to get to full speed and looks lost at times when diagnosing run plays. He is an effective player when moving decisively, but he can be out of place at times. Once in the backfield, he has trouble readjusting his body to get a clear burst toward the quarterback.
--NAME-- is undersized but has the tools to stay on the line at the next level and work mostly out of a 5-technique position, as he excels at working in short areas and being a scrappy, active player in the box. He has a good wingspan and is a long strider, which gives him great range to run down outside runs. He uses his arms well to keep linemen at bay, and he displays good technique to defeat blocks through hand fighting. He is an effective tackler with a lot of range. Although --NAME-- tends to get upright immediately at the point of attack, he is a good pass rusher who plays to his strengths.
-------------------------
Tommy_Streeter 2533539 198
--NAME-- started only one year at Miami. He has a very impressive frame, and the speed to match. He can make splash plays for his team right when he steps on the field. He has third-round value with the opportunity to ascend.
--NAME-- needs to develop the technical parts of his game to be able to demand consistent playing time on the outside. He false steps often at the snap and has a below-average burst off the line. Although he uses his length well to avoid defensive backs at the line of scrimmage, he could have issues once teams start to get in his face. He runs sloppy routes and isn't definitive in his movements.
--NAME-- has premier tools to stretch the field for an NFL offense. He excels at plucking jump balls thrown in his area. He really has come on strong of late in his ability to separate from defenders in short-to-intermediate routes.
-------------------------
Edwin_Baker 2533540 250
--NAME-- is entering the draft after a junior season that saw him displaced as Michigan State's top running back. A straight-line runner, --NAME-- had a very productive sophomore year but was beaten out by a younger back in 2011. He saw action as a kick-returner but didn't look capable of doing that in the NFL.
--NAME--'s prospects have been on the decline ever since he dropped on the Spartans' depth chart. He has average strength and explosiveness and struggles to make plays on his own. He has above-average speed but needs a clear path to daylight to ignite it, and he didn't see many of those in 2011. He has trouble sifting through tackles at the linebacker level and is mostly a one-speed runner. It's been a long time since he's displayed the competitiveness and will that he showed in 2010.
--NAME-- is a gradual accelerator who can get to the second level and through trash at the line of scrimmage. He is an inside runner who has the feel and patience to let blocks to develop. He is also a willing blocker with a decent base and the ability to jolt oncoming rushers.
-------------------------
Josh_Robinson 2533542 66
--NAME-- was a three-year starter with good ball skills and athletic ability. He has prototypical size and speed. Fifth-round value.
--NAME-- struggled at times playing man coverage. He will hesitate at times when diagnosing throws or trying to read his man's hips, and will guess on jumping routes which could be a risk at the next level. Struggles to make plays in run support after shedding his man, and will need to be more assertive in that area of his game.
--NAME-- has displayed superb zone skills. Aside from length, where he is only average, he has all the traits sought after in a zone corner. Not as polished in man, but he can run with receivers in the open field and will likely run in the 4.4 range at the combine. A reliable tackler in run support.
-------------------------
Bobby_Massie 2533543 112
--NAME-- is a massive offensive tackle who was nearly a three-year starter for Ole Miss and chose to forgo his last year of eligibility. --NAME-- was not a standout player in college and will have to find the right opportunity to land a spot on a roster as a rookie; he could get drafted late to a team with a need.
--NAME-- is not a very dynamic athlete and is a slow-footed mover. He is not a natural bender and is rigid in many of his movements. He labors to work to the second level and and struggles when sifting through traffic to engage his man. He relies on catching his man as a blocker in pass protection and will get in trouble with that technique at the next level.
Size is --NAME--'s best friend, as he was able to excel as a blocker in the run game simply from being able to maul his man. He rarely got blown back by defensive linemen in college and has a strong anchor that he sits nicely in after his pass set. He is more of a react-and-catch blocker who gets away with this technique solely because of his leg strength. He has decent range in his pass set and controls his man once engaged.
-------------------------
Bernard_Pierce 2533545 84
--NAME-- is an early-entry junior who had a very productive career at Temple. He is an athletic back who had a tough time staying healthy, which could be a concern for teams. He has good vision and can cut back across the field when jammed up. He isn't very powerful and likely would excel working within a zone-blocking offense in which he can take one cut and go. He has middle-round value.
--NAME-- won't be capable of many big-time plays due to his average speed. He struggles to recognize blitzes and has a tough time with knee bend.
--NAME-- is an upright, one-cut runner who has a good feel for working between the tackles. He is able to get a natural lean to cut up and avoid trash at the point of attack, and does a good job of bracing for contact to deliver blows. He is a natural mover in short areas who is capable of being productive in the right scheme. He can elude in space and has a feel for getting to daylight.
-------------------------
Brandon_Brooks 2534434 76
--NAME-- has only adequate quickness out of his stance, and it takes him time to get in his pass set from a three-point stance. NFL defensive linemen might be able to jump gaps or do a swim move by him. --NAME-- relies on his bulk and quicker defenders can fall off his blocks. --NAME-- also stands around too much if not engaged in a block, and commonly seen watching the play instead of finding a man to hit.
--NAME-- possesses a massive wide body that is not at all sloppy; just a naturally big man. Is more agile than expected, and is effective staying engaged down the line on moving pockets or zone runs. Defensive linemen will actually search for other blockers to engage rather than trying to take on --NAME--. He's strong enough to hold back a defensive end with one hand while watch for another rusher with his other hand. --NAME-- has some ability to hit linebackers at the second level, and then it is tough for those players to shed him even if he's not in perfect position.
