                    "Bottom Line": "Four-year starter with plenty of toughness. Appeared to struggle with an athletic decline in 2016, which could be due to his injury history. In a phone booth, Bisnowaty can handle himself with pure brawn and power, but once he's forced to play in space, his athletic limitations become more pronounced. He'll likely have to move to the right side, but athletic opponents will always cause him problems. His ceiling could be as a low-end starter while his floor is fighting for a roster spot within a couple of years.\n-Lance Zierlein",

                    "Strengths": "Well-built with proportional frame. Length is average, but his attention to arm extension helps make the most of it. Possesses good upper-body strength and his pass punch has some snap to it. Aggressively passes off twisting defensive ends to his guard. Does a good job of thumping at initial contact as run blocker. Rolls hips up under him after contact as a base blocker. Controlled climber to second level with a wide base. Wrestler in high school. Brawler with a mean streak. Able to exchange power for power if defender challenges him in a phone booth. Gets into his kick slide with good weight distribution.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Has missed time in each of his first three seasons with injuries to his ankle twice and back once. Limited bender with stiffness in his lower half. Unable to unlock hips and gain necessary ground in his pass sets. Lack of slide depth against speedy edge rushers forces him to open gate early and lunge. Appeared much more plodding in 2016 compared to his junior season. Struggles to change direction and unable to redirect weight back inside consistently enough to cut off inside moves. Able to get out into space but has a low connection percentage beyond line of scrimmage. Pad level way too high. Rarely able to get across the face of his opponent when zone blocking.",

Fires out of his stance and into blockers with coiled hips and a wallop in his punch. Strikes with leverage. Able to dislodge blockers with anchor issues. Plus athletic ability to mirror ball carrier once he locks in on target. Has speed to chase runners in space. Can set a strong edge or penetrate upfield. Makes impact tackles on the other side of the line. Hands are fast and powerful. Has strength and balance to fight through redirect blocks and maintain his journey to the quarterback. Uses powerful right-hand club to bat away blocker's punch and slide over the top and into the backfield. Constantly improving position as a pass rusher and can be a handful for a less-skilled pass protector. Pushes the pocket with his bull rush. Spends very little time on the ground. Intelligent; four straight years on Athletic Director's Honor Roll.",

Brings swagger to a linebacking corps. Never passive and always means it. Willing to take his shots downhill and into gaps. Lands strong warning blows on climbing guards early in the game. Coverage ability is an asset. Logged 10 passes defensed in 2015. Can carry long speed against running backs on wheel routes and nine routes. Has worked to improve tackling technique, which has yielded higher success rate of finishes.",

Works to stay ahead of reach blocks and contain the edge. Able to knife through gaps and create disruption in backfield. Uses dip and rip when he senses he can turn the corner. Speed-to-power ability when given a runway. Good lateral quickness and would benefit from twisting scheme that allows him to operate in space. Able to redirect suddenly. Can play with hand in the ground or standing. Takes swipes at the ball; forced four fumbles over last two seasons at Illinois. Played for defensive guru Lovie Smith in 2016.",

Face-up rusher with issues cornering edge with snug turn. Rushes without much of a plan and relatively few counter attacks. Was swallowed up by North Carolina right tackle Jon Heck, an inferior athlete. Needs more sand in his pants. Struggles to set a hard edge and can be kicked out by quality tackles.

Springy feet allow for abrupt click and close to the throw. Opens and swivels hips for desired transition in all directions. Experienced outside and from slot. Able to maintain coverage on shifty slot receivers. Instinctive with feel for route development. Possesses short-area closing burst. Confident on an island. Finds receiver on deep balls and gets head turned around. Dangerous slot blitzer with seven sacks over final two seasons at Colorado.",

Shows good feel for the pass-rush arc and understands when to attack the corner. Able to dip shoulder and pivot under and around an offensive tackle and into the quarterback. Hand usage well-timed as a rusher. Primarily a rusher but showed continuing improvement in technique at the point of attack. Should post impressive straight-line speed at the combine.

Has sinewy build that resembles a move tight end more than an NFL edge rusher. Arms and chest lack thickness and that shows up in his play strength. Is improving as edge-setter but he still needs work. Would benefit from a stronger initial punch. Athletic tackles with a well-timed punch can stymie his rush plans.

That sack number actually decreased from the year before, as he had 10.5 as a pass-rush specialist among his 12.5 tackles for loss.

Plays with good energy and gives you what he's got. Won't catch him leaning on blocks for a rest. Hands and feet are in constant concert to improve positioning and defeat run or pass blocks. Rushes with both effort and skill. Always working to the edge of a blocker with quick feet and violent hands. Change-of-direction talent creates difficulties for plodding guards. Had one of his finest games in upset over third-ranked Michigan.",

Doesn't linger on blocks long. Stacks and sheds with consistency. Locates ball quickly. Recognizes run-direction tendency from certain formations. Long, lateral step allows him to get head-start on blocker and prevent being reached. Quality motor and effort. Chases outside his area like he expects to make the play.

Has second gear to run under the long ball. Excels in intermediate and deep parts of the field. Route running showed improvement in 2016. Variable route speed creates indecision for defenders. Vertical routes are crisp and create tilt in off-corners and safeties that he is quick to take advantage of. Play speed features access to functional burst. Can defeat inside leverage.

Lateral scrapes sometimes lack patience forcing him to overrun run fits and open cutback lanes. Sometimes prioritizes attacking blockers too high. Has to get better at seeing and working past the blocker and toward the runner rather than issuing so many physical challenges that get him behind in pursuit.

Can set up and fire quickly from the pocket. When he sits down on throws, will use lower body to drive the ball through his targets. Gamer with a competitive streak that runs deep.

Kelly then moved on to East Mississippi Community College, and he won a national title in his only season there. Ole Miss took a chance on Kelly, and stayed with him after an altercation with a restaurant bouncer in Buffalo where he threatened to \"spray this place.\" The signing paid off in 2015, with Kelly earning second-team All-SEC nod (4,042 yards, 31 TD, 13 INT passing; 500 yards, 10 TD rushing)and the Sugar Bowl MVP while leading Ole Miss to wins over Alabama, Auburn and LSU in the same year for the first time in school history.

Uses choppy steps to slide and rarely allows his base to get too narrow in pass protection or in the run game. Plays with balance. Uses aggressive, tight settle-step into defender and then fires hands and hips to help generate push in run game. Has experience in zone- and gap-running schemes.

This production was anticipated by Auburn coaches in 2014 after Lawson was a Freshman All-American the previous season (7.5 tackles for loss, four sacks, two forced fumbles). He injured his left knee (ACL) in the spring, however, forcing him to take a medical redshirt. The following year he was named a team captain but again missed half of the year with a hip injury, managing just one sack in seven games. Lawson went through the Senior Day ceremony with his classmates this fall, knowing his college career was coming to an end."

Doesn't always bring his feet with him after contact, causing balance inconsistencies when trying to maintain his run blocks. Inconsistent footwork in pass sets. Gets caught mid-gallop at times and can be knocked off-balance. Opens up a little too early in his slides. Needs a more flat-footed punch approach. Played a lower level of competition.

Able to flip hips and accelerate quickly. Has lateral quickness and agility to flourish from the slot. Has adequate recovery speed to make up for an early mistake. Finds ball with back to quarterback as well as anyone in college. Maintains tight coverage downfield and waits for receiver's eyes to cue him in on when to turn and find it.

Slow field scanner who tends to lock into a single side. Too much eye-balling and not enough manipulating. Poor feel for pocket pressure. Two-year sack total of 58 is too high in play-action attack. Anchors deep in pocket and rarely climbs pocket to safe harbor. Oblivious to backside pressure until it's too late. Needs more air under the long ball. Deep-ball accuracy has been terrible.

Williams finished the year in the top 20 nationally with 1,420 rushing yards, also scoring 10 times in nine contests. He put up 333 yards and four touchdowns against UCLA in his second game back and finished his career with 222 yards and a touchdown in the team's Foster Farms Bowl win over Indiana."

Works to keep his blocks centered in his power zone. Easily redirects back inside to chase an inside challenge. Has loose hips and quick feet providing recovery ability. Plays with his length. Fluid in space and can get to challenging angles. Keeps battling to anchor if he gets bumped early. Finds ways to get his man blocked.",

Very good plant-and-go twitch. Looks to make plays taking aggressive routes to the ball. Logged four interceptions and seven pass breakups as a senior.

Switzer earned All-American honors again for his punt returns in 2015 (22-302, two TD) but also picked up third-team All-ACC recognition after leading the Tar Heels in receiving (55-697, six TD). His accomplishments as a receiver outweighed those for his return skills (16-106) in his senior year. League coaches named him first-team All-ACC as a receiver in 2016 because he finished tenth in the country with 96 receptions for 1,117 yards and six touchdowns."

His first three steps can throw an offense into disarray. When he times the snap, tackles have almost no chance of catching him at the edge. Wicked, whirling, dervish inside spin move that's reminiscent of Dwight Freeney's. Charges, coils, and springs up into tackles to help facilitate a quality bull rush. Game-wrecking potential. Has game experience against the likes of La'el Collins, Shon Coleman, Cam Robinson and Laremy Tunsil. Can play with a hand in the ground or standing. Able to spin in either direction out of block engagement. Lightning-fast inside charge extremely disruptive against the run. Gobbles up grass with long strides in open-field pursuit. Plus acceleration to the runner. Quick twitch creates ability to bound suddenly into running backs looking to charge past line of scrimmage. Outstanding rate as a tackle finisher with running backs and quarterbacks rarely escaping his clutches. Looks to maintain run fits rather than play hero ball.

As pass rusher, uses hands reactively too often rather than proactively. Gets too cozy with blockers and will ride block for too long. Needs more urgency in disengagement. Would benefit with violent stick-and-move punch quickness into blockers. Has to work overtime to set a strong edge. Gets uprooted and widened out by quality run-blocking tackles. Never played in more than 70 percent of the defensive snaps in any of his three seasons at Texas A&M. Scouts are convinced he took plays off to protect his health this season.",

High center of gravity made interior work a challenge at times. Can bend, but lets high pad level get the best of him. Doesn't consistently utilize his length with first hands.

Coaches voted him second-team all-conference after his junior year (76 tackles, 7.5 for loss, one interception, four pass break-ups) even though the Associated Press put him on their first-team All-American squad due to his all-around impact for the Tigers' defense."

Flourished in zone, gap and power schemes at FSU. At his best running wide while setting up lead blockers. Slows flowing safeties and linebackers with hesitation steps and glances back inside. Has run-away gear around the corner he keeps tucked away for special occasions. Darting style allows him to escape defenders who show gap commitment too soon. Plus vision. Quick to flow from first to second read on outside zone plays. Greedy redzone runner with ability to cash those checks. The brighter the lights, the bigger his game. Comfortable in both one-back and two-back groupings. Rare ability to cut it all the way back across the grain. Changes direction with degree of subtlety on second level without gearing down. Not much of a dancer. Tends to get hit it up the field. Feet in constant state of motion. Despite drops, can be dangerous out of backfield.",

Excellent vision to the perimeter becomes cloudier between the b-gaps. Will duck head and finish a run prematurely rather than probing for more interior space. Not always small through the crease. Flashes ability to finish with authority but makes business decisions at times. Hips not as fluid as expected. Would benefit from use of a hearty stiff-arm. Inconsistent hands in all phases. Ball security issues with 13 career fumbles. Suffers from focus drops out of backfield. Won't square-up on blitzers and may not be reliable enough as blocker to play on third downs.",

Has size and balance to pinball from one tackler to the next if he's not wrapped up. Jars linebackers and safeties at impact with his size alone. North-south runner.

Runs with high knees and athletic, long strides in the open field. Basketball standout in high school who uses nimble feet for an effective spin move. Can unleash spin counter in either direction. Plays on either side of the line and can play with a hand down or standing up. In 2015, led team in sacks, tackles for losses and hurries and was second in tackles. Uses early speed-to-power to create movement before attacking the tackle's inside shoulder. Showed some ability to drop in space when called upon.",

Plays with slow reaction time to counters and misdirection and can lose track of the ball. Needs earlier shoulder turn as rusher to prevent early pass sets from punching him as squared-up rusher. Slow to activate his counter spin back inside. More violent approach with hands at top of his rush would help grease the edge. Productivity dropped after struggling with new defensive scheme.",

Always in ready-to-rip throwing posture. Delivery is crisp and efficient. Locates safeties and reads their intentions immediately after the snap. Quick through his progressions and will double back to targets if his protection allows him time. Pocket mechanics and throwing motion are solid. Tough and competitive.

Benefits from offense loaded with RPOs (run-pass option) that pull linebackers forward and open easier throwing windows.

Too willing to float balls rather than air-mailing them out of bounds when he's making a bail-out throw against pressure. Needs better drive accuracy between the hashes.

Accelerates through receivers to jar the pass loose. Tackle finisher who races to the throw to end plays at the catch point. Scouts use terms like \"winner\" and \"top notch person\" to describe him.",

Forced into grab and drag scenarios to get running backs down at times. Small hesitation to accelerate when forced to open and sprint down the field. Can be too overzealous when stepping downhill to tackle. May need to play with a little more discipline and control as an NFL tackler.",

Plus hand-eye coordination. Natural ball-tracker who locates the deep ball early and watches it. Dangerous show-and-go open-field ability after the catch. Able to win with slants or fades near the goal line. Eludes the first tackler and can turn a short one into a long one in a heartbeat. Has enough size to work from outside or from the slot.

Has lateral quickness in run game to cross-face from backside and seal on the play-side. Can take quick settle steps, sinks and scoops defensive ends on base blocks. Quick feet allow for more patience to scan for stunts. Can meet edge speed with quick sets in pass pro. Plays with a mean streak and loves to finish.

Fluid in his play. Transitions from move to move. Unpredictable pass rush. Attacks both the edges and can crank up a bull rush. Uses swipes, rips and arm-over to unlock his rush. Hands and feet work in unison. Has lightning-quick spin move he can access to unhinge from block and find new life in his rush. Violent disengagements from blocks leave no doubt blocker is whipped.

Overall play strength can be improved. \"Big and strong\" across from him causes some issues. Gets engulfed at times. Snap-count guesser with seven offsides penalties in 2016.",

The next season, he started to terrorize quarterbacks, making 50 tackles, 17 for loss, and 14 sacks (tied for fifth in the FCS) in 12 games. Rivers played defensive end and linebacker as a junior (52 tackles, 15.5 for loss, eight sacks) and then really turned it on with Moss across the way in 2016.

Always active and in constant on-field search for optimal positioning. Hyper-aware of incoming targets to his area. Just as comfortable from \"robber\" spot as high safety. Mirrors quarterback's eyes to challenge the passing lane. Very rarely takes a false step. Has loose hips for sudden stop-start to cover in space. Great ball skills. Earned most of his seven interceptions in 2016. Can range over the top to challenge the deep ball. Chooses path to the football over path to the man.

Disruptive as first man in on twists. Always ready to leap into passing lane and deflect the throw. Strikes fast and early to create leverage points. Rarely has helmet involved in play and is constantly searching for the ball. Understands art of quick disengagements and can flatten out against outside run. Has good agility to clear trash near his feet and pursue the ball. Functional in space when asked to cover.

Reactive athleticism helps erase coverage mistakes. Extremely competitive with an edge that spikes after he's beaten. Timid receivers should take the day off. Aggressive from press with a powerful punch. Looks to intimidate when the opportunity arises. Drives receivers out of bounds and out of the play if their vertical release takes them too close to the boundary. Will not let a blocking receiver punk him.

Footwork becomes bulky and balance diminishes when matched against quality route workers. Plays a scrambling style of coverage that is too reliant upon his athletic gifts. Issues playing the deep ball are a concern. From off coverage, overreacts to route fakes and opens the door to a big play. Allowed more than 19 yards per completion as a starter.

Accuracy has improved in each season since his freshman year. Naturally accurate in his every day throws. Comfortable challenging defenders in space. Has arm strength and fearlessness to attack the cover-2 voids down the sideline. Can make deep, field side throws. Cranks up velocity to fit passes into tight windows. Former pitcher who propels hips through his release with aggressive torque and never gets cheated on his follow-through. Can deliver strikes from a variety of arm angles. Expedites release on RPOs (run-pass option) or when pressure is mounting in pocket. Puts effort into play-action fakes. Relaxed and effective when throwing on the move. Can be a legitimate dual-threat in a boot-action offense. Improved his eye manipulation over the years and will eyeball linebackers to hold them while patterns unfold around them.

Needs to improve anticipatory reads and learn to take what the defense gives him. Decision making can go from good to bad in a moment's notice. Operates from a narrow base and allows his upper body and arm to race ahead of his feet. Has a dip and wind-up in his standard release. Explosive delivery and follow-through causes some throws to sail. Needs better touch on intermediate and deep balls. Carries ball a little low in the pocket. Impatient.

Plucks it way out front of his body with strong, confident hands. Tremendous ball tracker with ability to search, find and follow the pass in over his shoulder. Has body control to twist and contort in mid-air to pull the throw in. Plays with sideline awareness and consistently drops feet in-bounds on boundary catches.

Has impressive burst to ball that brings him into range to make plays on the throw. Has the size and speed to stay with burners down the field. Springy leaper with catch radius to ruin the 50/50 tries. Always monitoring quarterback from off-man and zone. Will take a direct line to the ball when he decides to trigger. Has the hips and feet to mirror and match all over the field. Well-coached and experienced in a variety of techniques. Shows no fear when it's time to come get ball carriers as a tackler. Goes low and goes hard.",

Lacks desired muscular definition and needs a full year of work in an NFL weight program to pack on necessary muscle. Plays a little too upright at times.

Tightness through his hips limits stride length and agility in space. Can be slow to range from the hash to the boundary against deep ball unless he gets a head-start.

Races downhill to get a taste of what iso blockers are serving up. Three-down linebacker who showed off the speed to carry running backs down the field in coverage.

Has closing burst and enough wiggle to challenge the pocket as a blitzer.",

Can pinpoint passes to moving targets in his intermediate work. Has enough arm to work field side, intermediate throws. Great vision. Sees passing windows before they develop. Throws with outstanding timing and anticipation. Can put the ball on receivers' hands as soon as they come out of a break if coverage dictates it.

Slow to find the deep throw and make adjustments to the ball path. Allowed 21.7 yards per completion in 2016. Could struggle badly against a bombs-away offensive approach.

Athletic enough to play in multiple coverages. Displays necessary timing for high-point disruption even in a retreat. Able to maintain his feel for route down the field. Has a make-up gear when beaten and can close out separation distance. Looks to run through the receiver and deliver some thump after the catch. Heads up tackler looks to attack the legs and wrap-up. Has potential to challenge for a role as gunner or jammer on special teams.",

Lacks fluidity to recover quickly when beaten by route fakes. Will struggle to stick with complex routes. Doesn't always play to his size. Slow to disengage from perimeter blocks. Too passive on the perimeter and needs an angrier heart against the run. Needs to improve his lower body strength.

Has lateral escapability to put would-be tacklers on his highlight tapes. Gifted with unusually large hands and a powerful lower body that enhances his contact balance and ability to drive for extra yardage. Very good acceleration pulls him away from tacklers and into the clear. Relentless competitor. Had four touchdown runs of 83-plus yards this season. A true weapon out of the backfield that will be tough to matchup with. Has good hands and is very slippery in space.",

Benefitted from heinous angles to the ball from tacklers he faced. Way too eager to take plays off script. Wants to swing for the fences on every snap and will have to learn when to hit singles. Too eager to bounce everything. Takes his share of negative yardage carries. Feet are electric, but footwork and run track on zone plays needs work. Takes big hits from big men when trying to fight out of tackles and squeeze out extra yards. Stature and short arms make him a tougher target for quarterbacks.

Finds the deep throw quickly and makes necessary adjustments to ball flight to put himself in the best position to make the catch. Fear of his speed creates open, unchallenged throws underneath against spacious cushions. Athletic and not just a tight-hipped, straight line runner.

Has loose hips to flip around the edge like a basketball defender working over a screen. Has the fluidity and flexibility for tight cornering as pass rusher. Inside counter spin is a dangerous weapon he can feature more. Features big closing burst to the ball as a rusher and in pursuit of ball carriers. Has quickness out of stance to shoot gaps and stink up the backfield. Diagnoses wide flowing runs quickly and climbs over the top of tight ends racing ahead to maintain contain on the edge.",

                    "Weaknesses": "Was substantially lighter in the spring and will have to prove he can keep weight on while in the NFL. Has a tendency to attack down blocks and second level targets with hands wide. Tends to grab and hold rather than strike and secure when looking to seal blocks. Redirect power appears to be average.",

                "Analysis": {
                    "Bottom Line": "Teams like the Seahawks covet height, weight and speed prospects and Moore certainly fits in that slot. He doesn't always play to his timed speed, but when he opens it up, he can really move. Moore's biggest challenge could be creating space for himself inside his routes as his tight hips prevent the desired level of suddeness getting into and out of his breaks.\n-Lance Zierlein",
                    "Strengths": "Outstanding combination of size and speed. Ran a 4.42-second 40-yard dash at his pro day. Has the frame to overwhelm smaller cornerbacks. Was too physical for his level of competition to handle. Scored 23 touchdowns over the last two years. Feet are much quicker in tight quarters than expected. Quick to take off after the catch and has power to plow through tacklers. Will work back to his quarterback when needed",
                    "Weaknesses": "Route speed is erratic. Routes tend to be run at about 80 percent of this top speed and he will need to play faster on the next level. Too often unchallenged by quality opponents across from him. Plays with some hip-tightness that limits his ability to sink into breaks for sharp cuts. Needs to do a better job of attacking jump balls at the high point.",

Has the size and speed to interest defensive backs coaches, but his lack of starting experience and production may foreshadow his inability to contribute in coverage if he were to be called on. Colbert will have to make a roster based on his ability to shine on special teams.\n-Lance Zierlein",
                    "Strengths": "Impressed scouts with two 4.40-second 40-yard dashes at his pro day. Good combination of size and speed. May get a shot as a cornerback on the next level due to his physical traits. Was a core special teams talent while at University of Texas previously and has plenty of special teams tackles to his name.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Might not offer enough value as a defensive back to warrant a roster spot. Has registered very few starts at either Texas or Miami. When he's played, has an alarming amount of missed tackles because he fails to gather his weight and center his targets. Needs to improve his overall strength.",

                    "Bottom Line": "Holsey has a chip on his shoulder a mile wide after being snubbed from the combine and post season all-star games. He's got the instincts and short area athleticism to compete for slot duties and should be comfortable in zone coverage. His senior year production and solid workout may foreshadow an NFL career if he can keep his knees healthy.\n-Lance Zierlein",
                    "Strengths": "Plays with intensity and desired competitive nature from snap to whistle. Produced solid pro day results with short area tests, his 40-yard dash time and his vertical leap. Plays with good feet in tight quarters and shows a smoothness in transitioning from route to route in zone coverage. Instinctive pattern reader who has a feel for where quarterback is going. Produced ten passes defensed and three interceptions this year against just 50 targets. Put together a strong game against Clemson's Mike Williams.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Has suffered through two ACL tears in 2013 and 2015. Too short to play outside. Lack of length could cause problems for him when matched up against slot receivers with size. Aggressive mindset opens him up to double moves. Short-strider with average initial burst after turning to sprint. Will take the brunt of force when trying to strike physical running backs.",

                    "Bottom Line": "After a successful run at Mars Hill College, Williams was a graduate transfer to Miami where he proved to be a throwback lead blocker who created anticipation before his massive blocks. His ability to contribute on special teams will be determined, but even if he is just a lead blocker, he's good at what he does should make a roster because of it.\n-Lance Zierlein",
                    "Strengths": "To call him a dump truck filled with a load of power would be accurate. Extremely powerful. Set Miami weight room record with 381 pound power clean. Has enough flexibility in his lower body to sink and root out defenders as a lead blocker. Accelerates and explodes into contact as a blocker. Takes a crease and makes it a lane. Makes good reads and chooses his targets wisely. Does an adequate job of staying connected to his blocks. Showed some ability to catch the ball at Mars Hill College before he became a graduate transfer.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Will need to control his weight on the pro level as he has played much heavier in the past. Has to prove that he has value on special teams as a blocker and potential cover man. Will be a non-factor as a runner or on passing downs.",

Muhammad has the ability to compete for a roster spot as a return man and third or fourth running back, but teams will have to have a distinct plan for him as they move forward.\n-Lance Zierlein",
                    "Strengths": "Legitimate sprinter's speed with ability to blaze past flat-footed defenders. Possesses quality acceleration to get from first to second level. Runs tougher between the tackles than anticipated based on his stature. Capable pass catcher and return man. Has an opportunity to keep for a roster spot as a core special teams player.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Very slightly built with thin legs. Durability could be a concern on the next level. Despite his speed, he has no return touchdowns on special teams. Unlikely to be trusted in blitz pick-up due to his size.",

                    "Bottom Line": "Slightly undersized interior linemen with above average quickness and the overall athleticism to make plays on the move. Carrell needs to add good weight and improve his overall strength to stand up to bigger offensive linemen, but he has a shot to make a roster thanks to his athletic ability.\n-Lance Zierlein",
                    "Strengths": "Was durable and productive over his two seasons at Colorado. Very athletic for his size. Pad level is usually very good. Maintains a balanced, base with good width when engaging blockers. Plays with light feet and above average lateral quickness when springing down the line of scrimmage after a ball-carrier. Has closing burst to the perimeter to chase scrambling quarterbacks. Uses subtle, but strong hands to clear his frame of blocker's punch. Has expanded tackle radius due to reactive athleticism. Able to stuff cut blocks and avoid the trash near his feet.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Doesn't have a clean position fit. Is a little small for interior and lacks length as five-technique. Needs to improve his upper body strength to hold up inside. Doesn't always attack blockers with as much force as needed to take control of the rep. Gets reached on play-side running plays more than he should. Is a step slow to diagnose run direction. Very average as a pass rusher. Needs to learn how to win on the edges as opposed to occupying blockers.",

                    "Bottom Line": "Productive, three-year starter who has feasted on weaker offensive tackles with 28.5 tackles for loss over the last two seasons. O'Connor has adequate strength and an intriguing get-off as a rusher, but he still has plenty of work to do against the run and in supplementing his pass rush technique if he wants to make a team.\n-Lance Zierlein",
                    "Strengths": "Three-year starter who was named team captain twice. Productive upfield player with a nose for the ball. Forced seven fumbles over the last two seasons including five in 2016. Has a talent for the strip sack. Comes off the ball with solid upfield burst into his rush. Uses forward lean around the corner to generate momentum. Uses strong initial punch to set the edge against the run. Has upper body power to disengaged and attack running backs.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Straight line attacker with below average lateral agility. May struggle with sudden changes of direction and necessary counters. Can be too upright at the top of his rush allowing tackles to redirect him beyond the rush arc. Pass rush needs refinement including his hand usage. Missed all of 2015 with a shoulder injury.",

                    "Bottom Line": "Schreck needs to add more weight to his frame in order to take on additional blocking responsibilities on the pro level, but he shows a willingness to do the work. He's more of a move tight end than a matchup target or inline blocker, but he's got the ability to do a little of everything that is asked of him. It may take a little time, but Schreck has the potential to be a backup tight end who can add something to a roster.\n-Lance Zierlein",
                    "Strengths": "Solid height, weight, speed numbers for the position. Displayed quality explosion numbers at his pro day. Typically a hands catcher who will extend to meet the ball. Had just one drop last season to his 59 catches. Plays to his size after the catch with an ability to drag tacklers for additional yardage. Was a flexed out option, but does have quality experience as run blocker. Patient in his approach as a blocker and keeps his hands inside opponent's frame. Gives good effort to sustain his blocks on perimeter.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Lower half could use more muscle. Needs to do a better job of fighting through redirects and handsy linebackers in coverage. Is too upright into his breaks. Needs to improve his route running to increase separation out of his breaks. Doesn't always have 'catch-ready' hands when his quarterback is looking to put it on him quickly.",
