On the field, he is a strong relentless pass rusher who uses his hands to keep blockers at bay.  However, he is a bit of tweener at this point, as he does not have the bulk to be stout against the run and lacks the athleticism to play linebacker in a 3-4 defense.  Acho will win the interview and could be picked on Day 2 by a team impressed with his intelligence and character."

Lacks experiencing catching the football and pass blocking but has the makeup and skills to succeed in both areas.  Allen currently carries a late-round grade."
