                    "Compares To": "RODDY WHITE-Atlanta...Like White, Franklin has the valid speed to threaten the deep secondary, but is not the greatest route runner. He needs to be more elusive after the catch, rather than rely on his timed speed to help him escape. He will lose concentration at times and is prone to trapping the ball, but seems to work better on attacking the deep third of the zone than working in a crowd. He has a smooth release and gets into his route quickly, when he uses his hand to defeat the press, but does not do it all the time. He has courage underneath, but despite looking the part, he does not use his strength to stop defenders from knocking him around in a crowd. He has a verified learning disability and will need time to digest a playbook. Much like White, it will be a few years before this kid will settle into a routine at the next level, but with his speed a patient coach could unearth a nice second-day talent.",
                    "Negatives": "Has a confirmed learning disability that requires extra assistance with school work...Will need extra reps in practice due to poor mental retention...Has valid speed to stretch the field, but needs to refine his pattern running, as he rounds off his routes, especially double moves and slants (more a product of what the system asks from him)... Willing to compete for the ball in a crowd, but does not show the playing strength to be an effective receiver on short routes, as he will get knocked off shallow crossing routes by linebackers and drops a few balls due to a lack of concentration when working in a crowd (has courage, just tends to get distracted when he hears the defender's foot steps)...Will compete for the ball in a crowd, but not always, as he has pulled up on short balls in traffic when he thinks he has no chance of getting to it...Lacks enthusiasm and playing strength as an in-line blocker and gets warded off at the point of attack, but is adequate as a cut blocker in the second level...Has matured, but openly complained and was a bit of a problem to handle his first few years in the program (comes from a rough background and had a chip on his shoulder when he arrived on campus)...Has good cutting ability in the open, but on shorter routes he takes too long coming out of his breaks...When he keeps his hands active, he can ward off the jam, but when his chest is exposed defenders are quick to ward him off and knocked him off his route...Has the speed to elude, but needs to be more elusive in his patterns, as he tends to run right into a crowd...Has natural hands, but will revert to trapping the ball or letting it into his body...Needs to secure the ball better before turning up field to reduce costly turnovers.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has the rare sized frame teams look for - minimal body fat (7.2%), natural muscle thickness throughout, long limbs, large, soft hands, outstanding leaping ability, thick thighs and calves, tight waist, hips and abdomen and room on his frame to carry at least another 15 pounds of bulk with no loss in quickness...Has the sudden burst to get a clean release off the snap and valid hand strength to defeat the press...Smooth runner with excellent timed speed, showing the ability to drop his weight when making cuts, displaying good body control throughout his running stride...Shows good instincts and awareness on the field, quickly finding the soft areas to settle under...Called by QB Chase Daniel the team's most alert receiver, as more than 20 percent of his catches came after breaking off his routes and coming back to help when the pocket was pressured the last two years...Has really improved his competitiveness the last few years, displaying more fire than he did earlier in his career, displaying true courage and a desire to make plays after the catch, and will compete for the ball in a crowd...Took a while to adjust to college life and the staff felt that he had a bad attitude and complained a lot when he first entered the Missouri program, but has completely changed and has consistently improved his work in the weight room and on the practice field...Has become a vocal leader who will get in his teammates' faces...Has a good burst and shows good quickness after the catch, utilizing effective head fakes and wiggle to make the initial tackler miss...Possesses quick feet that allow him to change directions swiftly, as he has the balance to drop his pads and show crispness in and out of his cuts...Shows good quickness from scrimmage vs. press coverage, demonstrating a strong hand strike to surprise a lethargic defender...Has a very smooth release off the line, showing an ability to elude bump-and-run coverage with quick feet, good fakes and a sharp burst...Drops his weight well while making cuts and gets back to the ball very efficiently, doing a fine job of slipping underneath coverages and uses his body well to shield defenders from the ball...Demonstrates good field awareness and body control along the sideline, getting his feet down in bounds...Looks for the yard marker and takes good angles as a second-level cut blocker...Even with his valid speed, he doesn't really blow past defenders, but shows enough burst to stretch the field and is best when he can find holes in the defense and settle in...Displays good, soft hands and the ability to pluck high and away from his frame, as he can also catch the deep, over-the-shoulder balls with his hands extended away from his frame...Demonstrates good body control while adjusting to low balls and balls thrown behind him and has no problems sacrificing his body to go vertical (suffered a torn labrum stretching out for the ball vs. Iowa State in 2006, but says he will do it again, if needed)...Reacts well to the ball in flight and while he is not really a shifty receiver, he will pick up yards after the catch with head fakes and the valid speed to escape...Shows good toughness while battling for extra yards...Threatens the deep secondary consistently, as he has the timed speed to gobble up the cushion and get behind the opponent before the defensive back has a chance to recover...Willing to compete for jump balls or combat defenders in a crowd...Not really excited about blocking at the X's, but has good angle concept and field awareness to cut block.\r"

                "Overview": "Overshadowed most of his career by heralded teammates Chase Daniel, Martin Rucker, Chase Coffman and Jeremy Maclin, Franklin has caught the attention of professional teams with his team-first attitude, blazing speed and naturally soft hands. The nephew of former Cincinnati Bengals standout wide receiver Darnay Scott, Franklin credits Scott with inspiring him to pursue football.\r\nFranklin would go on to start 36 games during his career with the Tigers, seeing action as a slot receiver and at the \"X\" position. He placed his name in the school record books, as both his 143 receptions and 2,125 yards gained rank fourth in Missouri history.\r\nFranklin began his high school career at Beaumont High School, but transferred to Vashon High before his junior campaign, which had a better basketball program. On the football field, he earned All-State, All-Metro and All-League honors as a senior, as he was ranked 40th among the nation's wide receiver prospects by Rivals.com, who ranked him as the eighth-best overall prospect in Missouri.\r\nThat season, Franklin grabbed 37 passes for 907 yards and 17 touchdowns to help the squad claim the Class 4A district title.  As a sophomore at Beaumont High, he had 367 yards receiving and nine touchdowns and added four interceptions on defense, as he was named All-League. A solid basketball player who lettered in that sport at both schools, he was given a nickname of \"Helicopter\" by his friends for his high-flying aerial antics on the court.\r\nFranklin enrolled at Missouri in 2004, seeing action in 11 games at the \"X\" receiver position behind Brad Ekwerekwu. He managed just six catches, but they were good for 174 yards (29.0 avg) and a touchdown. He shifted to slot receiver in 2005, starting all but the Nebraska game. He gained 413 yards on 40 receptions (10.3 avg) with two scores and rushed eight times for 17 yards (2.1 avg).\r\nThe 2006 season saw Franklin take over at the \"X\" receiver position. He was well on his way to earning conference postseason honors, but he landed on his right shoulder making a first quarter dive at a pass vs. Iowa State, suffering a torn labrum that required surgery. The injury forced him to sit out the team's final two games, finishing third on the squad with 48 catches for 829 yards (17.3 avg) and six touchdowns. \r\nAs a senior, Franklin was named All-Big 12 Conference honorable mention. He started all 14 games at \"X\" receiver, coming up with a career-high 49 receptions for 709 yards (14.5 avg) and four touchdowns.\r\nIn 48 games at Missouri, Franklin started 36 contests. He ranks fourth in school history with 143 catches for 2,125 yards (14.9 avg) and 13 touchdowns. He rushed nine times for 9 yards, fielded one punt for no return yardage and scored 82 points."

                    "Compares To": "HAROLD CARMICHAEL-ex-Philadelphia...You might have to ask your dad who Harold Carmichael was, but Hardy is in the same mold -- a tall, lanky receiver with a great reach and excellent leaping ability whose jump ball skills will create nightmares for smaller cornerbacks. Those defenders generally get into lots of trouble trying to stop Hardy from getting to the jump balls, evident by the 10 pass interference penalties charged to those covering Hardy in 2007. Some say he is like the Giants' Plaxico Burress, but he lacks the bulk, strength and explosive burst that Burress brings with his game. Use him on fades or bubble screens and he is sure to move the chains, but he is going to have to dedicate a few hours to the weight room, as his lack of ideal strength could become an issue, especially trying to beat the jam.",
                    "Negatives": "Needs to add bulk and more muscle tone to his body, as he has the linear build of a basketball player...His lanky frame poses problems, as he struggles vs. the more physical cornerbacks to get off the line due to marginal upper-body strength in attempts to get a push off the jam...Not a sharp route runner, as he does take some soft angle cuts...Best on controlled or intermediate routes, as he lacks the timed speed to gobble up the cushion and get behind the speedy cornerbacks on deep routes (would be more effective if he shortened his stride coming out of his cuts)...Has had concentration problems, resulting in a fair share of dropped balls...Lacks aggression and desire as a blocker...Needs to show better awareness on corner and post routes as it seems he wants to turn and run  before properly securing the ball...Shows some wasted motion trying to accelerate and burst when running underneath routes...Has some character issues and one off-field problem that needs further clarification, and he must be upfront in interviews at the Combine... Despite his size and leaping ability, he only caught 79 of 144 balls thrown to him in 2007, as the opposition managed to deflect 21 of those passes.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has that rare-sized frame with an impressive combination of long limbs, excellent leaping ability and timing to high-point the ball...Has just adequate speed, but is deceptively quick getting into his routes...Needs to get stronger, but is a playmaker who uses his tall frame and long arms to get to a lot of off-target throws...Will struggle to defeat the press, but if he gets a clean release, he builds his acceleration steadily...Not the type that will separate after the catch, but can elude to get extra yardage...His height poses a great challenge for smaller defenders, especially on fades and post patterns...Gathers to make his cuts and while he lacks blazing speed, he is light on his feet...Moves well in space, showing smooth comeback running ability in the zone...Tough in a crowd, using his size to wall off and shield the ball from the defender...Sticks his foot in the ground to change direction and does a nice job of setting up the defender with good stutter-step moves after the catch... More of a shifty route runner than sudden, but he has loose hips and the juke moves needed to make the initial tackler miss...Quite effective on the bubble screen, as he uses his long arms well to look the ball in...Too tall to sink his pads as well as the other receivers, but uses his deceptive speed to generate movement...When he maintains good concentration, he is very effective at catching in a crowd...Does a good job of tracking the ball in flight while making proper body adjustments to get under the pass...Snaps off his route and comes back for the off-target throws...Has large, soft hands, plucking the ball out of the air with his long fingers properly extended...Has excellent arm extension to maintain position for the high passes... Like Keyshawn Johnson, he has the ability to keep his feet inbounds working the sideline and the flexibility to catch the over-the-shoulder passes...Runs with good body lean and while he won't win many open field foot races, he has the stride and stop-and-go action that allows him to suddenly freeze the defender after the catch...Shows a decent burst running the flash screen, but it is ability to adjust in stride that lets him get into position to make the catch.\r"

                "Overview": "James Hardy was a coveted basketball prospect. A 185-pound Elmhurst High School product arrived in Bloomington intent on taking part in IU's hoops legacy in 2004. After one season with that team, the lanky athlete decided to commit to the gridiron. By the time he decided to leave for the National Football League three years later, he had shattered the school's season and career receiving records.\r\nHardy is the only wide receiver in Indiana history to surpass 2,500 yards, 175 receptions and 35 touchdowns. He finished his career with 36 scores on 191 catches, good for 2,740 yards. He also made a significant contribution on the basketball team as a freshman. During the 2004-05 campaign, he played in 23 games, starting three times, as he averaged 1.7 points, 1.8 rebounds and 10.7 minutes per contest.\r\nHardy was a two-sport standout at Fort Wayne Elmhurst High School, where he was named All-SAC as a wide receiver after making 34 catches for 731 yards and 10 touchdowns as a senior. Following his final campaign, he was a Class 4A All-State selection by the Indiana Football Coaches Association. \r\nHardy is the all-time leading scorer in Fort Wayne high school history. He was a two-time recipient of the Tiffany Gooden Award, given to the most out-standing male or female player in The Summit Athletic Conference, as chosen by The Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette. \r\nHardy led the team to a Class AAA state runner-up finish in 2002-03 after averaging 23 points, nine rebounds and four assists. As a senior, Hardy averaged 27.3 points, 9.8 rebounds and 2.5 assists, as the team finished with a 16-8 record. He was rated the 78th-best prep basketball player in the nation on the Insiders.com Top 100 squad. \r\nAfter spending the 2004 football season with the scout team and the 2004-05 campaign with the basketball squad, Hardy concentrated strictly on football in 2005. He earned second-team All-Big Ten Conference honors, in addition to being a member of Rivals.com's Freshman All-American team. \r\nHardy started five of 10 games he appeared in at split end, missing the Michigan clash with a strained Achilles tendon. He led the Big Ten with an average of 89.3 yards per game receiving in 2005. His 61 catches rank third on the school's single-season record list, as he totaled 893 yards with 10 touchdowns.\r\nOn the field, Hardy had an equally impressive performance in 2006 as he did during his redshirt freshman season. But off the field, trouble followed. He was arrested on May 19 on charges of domestic battery and interfering with the reporting of a crime, after his girlfriend accused him of hitting her and the couple's infant child. \r\nHardy pleaded not guilty to the charges and later accepted a court's offer in Fort Wayne to settle his case through a pretrial diversion agreement. By accepting the program, he had to comply with the conditions of the agreement and pay court costs. He also apologized to his teammates and IU in his statement. \r\nThere were problems with Hardy and Indiana's late head coach Terry Hoeppner. After the second game of the 2006 season, the two met privately, resulting in the coach suspending Hardy for two games (vs. Southern Illinois and Connecticut). \r\nWhen Hardy returned to the lineup, he was rusty from his layoff and was flagged for critical offensive pass interference on the Hoosiers' opening drive of the Wisconsin clash, finishing with an eight-yard catch for the day. He soon got back into his rhythm, catching at least five passes in six of his last seven games, finishing with 51 receptions for 722 yards (14.2-yard average) and 10 touchdowns.\r\nAs a junior, Hardy received several All-American first-team honors, in addition earned All-Big Ten Conference accolades. He led the team and ranked second in the league, as he set school season-records with 79 catches for 1,125 yards (14.2-yard average) and 16 touchdowns.\r\nIn 36 games at Indiana, Hardy started 26 contests. He finished his career by hauling in 191 passes for 2,740 yards (14.4 avg) and 36 touchdowns. He also scored 216 points and recorded one solo tackle."

He's not a physical receiver, nor does he relish a role blocking. He still needs to refine his route running and will gather and drift in his routes. If used on controlled routes or underneath, he has the size to compete for the jump ball and uses his body control effectively near the sideline.

Uses his long arms to scoop low throws and, though he will trap some throws, he knows how to get into position to make the catch...Long strider with the body lean to fall forward to move the chains...Struggles to run away from speedy cornerbacks, but has developed some savvy to elude at times. \r"

He responded by starting the year with three straight 100-yard receiving games. By the time the season ended, he would become just the seventh player in school history to catch more than 50 passes (54) in a season and only the third Jayhawk to amass over 1,000 yards (1,014) receiving.\r\nHenry was an all-around athlete at Eisenhower High School. He earned a total of nine letters in football, basketball and track. He was named the school's Receiver of the Year in 2003 and 2004, adding All-Conference and All-Area honors.\r\nThe lanky 180-pound receiver was a late addition to Kansas' 2004 recruiting class, joining the team during fall camp after turning down scholarship offers from Texas Tech and Tulsa. He appeared in 10 games as a reserve, grabbing eight passes for 85 yards (10.6-yard average). \r\nWorking hard during the offseason, Henry showed up for 2005 spring drills with approximately 15 additional pounds of bulk on his frame.

He also recorded two solo tackles.\r\nAs a junior, Henry continued to increase his overall strength. The 205-pounder started 10 of 12 contests in 2006. He ranked third on the team, snaring 25 passes for 316 yards (12.6-yard average), scoring three times.

                "Overview": "In a program known for its running game, Malcolm Kelly might not have gotten as many opportunities as other lead receivers. \r\nHe made the most of the chances he did have, making the passing game another weapon in the Sooners' arsenal over the last three years from the split end position.\r\nDespite playing only three seasons at Oklahoma, he finished his career as the school's fifth-leading receiver with 144 catches. He also ranks second on the Sooners' all-time record list for receiving yardage (2,285), touchdown catches (21) and games with at least 100 yards receiving (nine). His 21 scoring receptions also rank tied for seventh in Big Twelve Conference history.\r\nAt Longview High School, Kelly was a three-time All-District first-team wide receiver, adding All-State accolades as a junior and senior. He was named first-team All-East Texas by the Texas Sports Writers Association. He received a five-star prospect rating from Scout.com and four stars from Rivals.com. Rivals.com also rated him sixth on their Texas Top 100 List. He was rated the best receiver in Texas by Scout.com and 13th in the nation by ESPN.com.\r\nKelly hauled in 29 passes for 638 yards (22-yard average) and nine touchdowns during his senior campaign. During his junior year, he was credited with 27 receptions for 826 yards (30.6 avg), including six scores.\r\nOklahoma won a recruiting war vs. LSU, Nebraska, Texas and Tennessee for Kelly's services in 2005. He was named to The Sporting News' Freshman All-American team as an honorable mention and All-Big Twelve Conference first-team. He started seven of 11 games, lining up for five contests at flanker before shifting to split end for the final two contests. The true freshman paced the Sooners with 471 yards on 33 catches (14.3-yard average), coming up with a pair of touchdowns.\r\nFirmly entrenched at split end, Kelly received second-team All-Big Twelve Conference honors in 2006. He led the team in receiving for the second straight year, coming up with a career-high 62 receptions for 993 yards (16.0-yard average) and 10 touchdowns. He also posted one solo tackle. He averaged 70.93 yards receiving per game, the fifth-best total in the league that year, but he had a concussion early in the year vs. Texas A&M and suffered knee cartilage damage vs. Boise State in the Fiesta Bowl and was limited in 2007 spring drills.\r\nKelly helped break in a new quarterback in Sam Bradford in 2007, as the receiver earned All-Big Twelve second-team recognition. He ranked second on the team, grabbing 49 passes for 821 yards (16.8-yard average) and nine touchdowns. He missed most of the Oklahoma State clash with a hip pointer suffered on the game's first play and for the second straight year, he made an early exit from the Fiesta Bowl with a leg contusion.\r\nIn 39 games at Oklahoma, Kelly started 34 times, including 29 at split end and five more at flanker. He finished with 144 receptions for 2,285 yards (15.9-yard average) and 21 touchdowns. He also recorded a pair of solo tackles."

Like Moss, if he has a clear path, he will torch the deep secondary and is known as a playmaker. The problem is, unless he gets more physical vs. the press and plays with better moxie going over the middle, Manningham looks like a classic boom-or-bust prospect.",
                    "Negatives": "Has a slight frame with marginal strength and struggles to maintain additional bulk...In previous attempts to put on weight, it has impacted his quickness, making him look sluggish coming out of the gate and into his routes...Always looking for the home run, which will lead to concentration lapses, resulting in drops of easily catchable balls (was successful in getting to only 72 of 142 passes thrown to him)...Shows little willingness to sacrifice his body and get to the ball in a crowd, as he is more conscious of the defender closing on him, resulting in several dropped balls (converted just 12-of-42 third-down plays he was involved in during 2007)...Had an off-field incident that might need further clarification...Passive blocker who prefers to just \"pester\" his man and does not make much of an effort to sustain blocks...Likes to cradle the ball and sometimes will try to turn and run before he has properly secured the pigskin (does not have fumble issues, but did have several costly drops in 2007 -- see Oregon, Michigan State, Wisconsin and Ohio State games)...Competes better when he knows he will be the primary target, tending to throttle down when not involved in the play (resulted in his being benched briefly early in the season and be cited by coach Carr for a less than urgent performance on the field)...Needs to improve his balance coming back for off-target passes (does not get down well enough to make shoestring catches)...Must time his leaps better and improve his jumping ability, as he will lose more than a fair share of battles going for the pass at its high point (had 20 passes deflected away from him in 2007)...Needs to improve his overall strength, as the more physical defenders have good success in pressing and rerouting him (relies mostly on his speed to elude)...Must display better courage when operating over the middle and he shies away from contact...Liability for the ground game, as he is very hesitate when asked to cut block, will not face up to an opponent and takes poor angles.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has adequate shoulder width and room on his frame to add more bulk, but only if it won't impact his quickness...Has exceptional speed and acceleration to suddenly burst off the snap and get into his routes (will struggle vs. a press)...Shows good sideline awareness and the ability to make the tough catch with his back to the quarterback...Can also surprise a second-level defender with his suddenness coming out of his breaks...Sharp pitter-patter route runner with a fluid change of direction...Plants and drives well on his routes and is alert to the stationing of deep coverage...Runs with very good agility and balance (fluid, natural motion) and is able to get to top speed instantly when he is not facing a strong jam...Has the body control to get in and out of his routes and is very elusive after the catch...Not the type that will go over the middle for the ball, but he is slippery trying to avoid tacklers...Very quick to see and adjust to the secondary's moves and has big-play ability after the catch...His straight-line burst allows him to consistently stretch the field...Creates a lot of separation on his own and can find space in the zone seams...Has the burst to separate deep separation and sideline body control to make acrobatic catches seem routine...Has a sudden burst out of his cuts and is known for making the off-balance grabs near the sidelines...Has the quickness to consistently beat defenders on deep routes...Makes most of his yardage after the catch, easily turning the defensive back on his routes while kicking into second gear to run away from his man...While he lacks the strength to escape the jam, he has the speed to elude...Able to drop his weight and show good body control in his short-area patterns and can get open deep due to his quickness coming out of the break...Has quick plant-and-cut ability and loves when the defenders give him even the tiniest of cushions...Shows smooth and fluid body adjustments while tracking the ball in flight...A liability when used on inside routes, but has the speed and suddenness to separate on the perimeter...Has good body flexibility to adjust to the ball in flight and, when he maintains concentration, he does a good job of looking the ball in and catching it with hands extended away from his frame...Has gazelle-like moves in the open field and though he lacks bulk to break tackles, he has the vision and elusiveness to make big plays...Shows good hip wiggle, shake and burst to take a defensive back out of his backpedal earlier than desired and has that game-breaking ability to stretch the field.\r"

                "Overview": "Mario Manningham is as smooth as his middle name -- Cashmere -- when it comes to running routes.\r\nThe slight-framed receiver had great success as the favorite target for Wolverine quarterback Chad Henne. Playing mostly at split end, he finished his career ranked fifth in school history for receiving yards (2,310), fourth in touchdown catches (27) and ninth for receptions (137). All but seven of his touchdown grabs have come from outside the red zone.\r\nAt Warren G. Harding High School, Manningham was a Parade All-American, first-team All-State, All-District and All-Conference selection as a junior and senior. He was rated 12th on the Detroit Free Press \"Best of the Midwest\" list and was a four-star prospect that was ranked the fifth-best receiver nationally and third-best prospect in Ohio by Rivals.com.\r\nCollege Football News rated Manningham as the sixth-best wide receiver and 43rd player overall in the country. He was named Prep Star's Dream Team as the sixth-rated receiver prospect in the nation and was named the seventh-best receiver prospect by Student Sports Hot 100 recruits.\r\nManningham started the last two years of his three-year career. He had 105 catches for 1,883 yards and 24 receiving touchdowns in his final two seasons and also tallied four interceptions at cornerback during his career. He had 52 receptions for 821 yards and 10 touchdowns during his senior season, including seven grabs for 251 yards and three scores vs. Glenville, as he clinched the team's victory with an interception and 50-yard return for a score in the waning moments.\r\nManningham caught 32 passes for 626 yards and 11 touchdowns as a junior and made 21 catches for 436 yards and three scores his sophomore year. He also lettered in basketball, earning honorable mention All-State his senior year. The three-year varsity letterwinner averaged 17 points as a senior after posting a career-best 21-point average his junior year, gaining All-Conference and All-District honors during his final two years.\r\nAs a freshman at Michigan in 2005, Manningham was a Freshman All-American honorable mention and Freshman All-Big Ten Conference choice by The Sporting News. The UM receiver was going to enroll at Ohio State, but the Wolverines wrested him away from his in-state team. He went on to catch 27 passes for 433 yards (16.0-yard average) and six touchdowns while starting three of 12 games at split end, sharing that spot with Steve Breaston.\r\nA partially torn medial collateral ligament and meniscus in his right knee vs. Michigan State required arthroscopic surgery in 2006, as Manningham started nine of 10 games in which he played. The Rivals.com All-American third-team pick finished third on the squad with 38 catches for 703 yards (18.5-yard average) and nine scores while lining up at flanker.\r\nManningham shifted back to split end in 2007, starting 11 of 12 games. He led the team with 72 receptions and led the Big Ten Conference with 1,174 yards (16.3-yard average), as he scored 12 times. He also rushed 19 times for 119 yards. \r\nWhile his 72 catches are impressive, the fact that he had 142 passes thrown to him, leaving 70 potential receptions on the field, drew the ire of former head coach Lloyd Carr, who said Manningham didn't play as well as he can.\r\nManningham was also suspended by the coaching staff for the Eastern Michigan game, for what Carr first cited as a violation of team policy. It was later revealed that the staff was made aware of an off-field incident on April 25. He was one of three people in a car registered to Manningham's father on a road from Ann Arbor to his home in Ohio. \r\nIn southern Monroe County, not far from the state line, an unmarked car pulled up behind the Cadillac. The sheriff's deputy searched the three young men and the car. The two passengers had a small amount of marijuana in their clothing. The deputy found 500-milligram tablets of Vicodin, a prescription pain killer and a controlled substance, in Manningham's pockets and a couple in his suitcase in the trunk. \r\nThe three young men were arrested and transported to a nearby State Police post. \r\nManningham was questioned about the pills. He said that after undergoing surgery in January, he had been prescribed Vicodin, but he had run out and borrowed a few from a teammate for his upcoming car trip. \r\nIn late October, prosecutor William Nichols announced he has decided no warrant against Manningham would be issued and he would not be charged with a felony for possession of Vicodin pills not specifically prescribed for him. He could have been charged with a felony.\r\nManningham closed out his career by starting 24 of the 34 games in which he played. He had 137 receptions for 2,310 yards (16.9-yard average) and 27 touchdowns, scoring 162 points. He added 176 yards on 31 carries and 17 yards on a punt return, amassing 2,503 all-purpose yards, an average of 73.62 yards per game."

He won the Class 3A track titles in the 100, 200 and 400 meters and long jump at the 2003 state meet, and set division records in the 100 meters (10.63) and 200 meters (21.64).\r\nDespite his impressive prep career, Nelson walked on at Kansas State in 2003. He competed on the scout team at strong safety over the next two years, but never got on the playing field. With the KSU receiving unit depleted by graduation, Nelson asked to move to that unit in 2005. \r\nHe was a second-team All-Big 12 Conference choice that year, leading the team with 45 receptions for 669 yards (14.9 avg.) and eight touchdowns, adding another score by recovering a blocked punt in the end zone for a score vs. Texas A&M. During the season, he became the first player in school history to catch at least one touchdown in each of his first seven games.\r\nA nagging left knee posterior cruciate ligament forced Nelson to miss quite a bit of early season practice time in 2006. He started nine of 13 games, managing to lead the squad with 39 catches for 547 yards (14.0 avg.), but just one touchdown. He also got to see some time at quarterback, completing one of two passes for 28 yards.\r\nThe consensus All-American shattered school and Big 12 Conference season records in 2007, hauling in 122 passes for 1,606 yards (13.2 avg.) and 11 touchdowns. He scored twice on five punt returns for 264 yards (52.8 avg.) and registered a school record 140 points. He hit on 2-of-4 passes for 45 yards and a pair of touchdowns, finishing with 1,863 all-purpose yards, an average of 155.25 per game.\r\nIn 36 games at Kansas State, Nelson started 32 contests. He ranks second in school history with 206 receptions for 2,822 yards (13.7 avg.) and is third in KSU annals with 20 touchdown grabs. He returned six punts for 267 yards (44.5 avg.) and three scores, as he also completed 3-of-6 passes for 73 yards and two touchdowns, adding seven tackles (6 solos) on special teams. He finished with 3,080 all-purpose yards, an average off 85.56 per game."

With his impressive physique, he could be an inviting target over the middle, as he will not hesitate to mix it up with a defender.

                "Overview": "Pound-for-pound, Thomas is one of the strongest receivers in college football. A well-built athlete with massive upper body muscle tone, Thomas not only has the strength to power through arm tackles, but also displays blazing quickness. He succeeded in a variety of roles for the Wolverines since the arrival of new head coach Mark Dantonio, who unearthed the junior's talents in 2007.\r\nAfter a promising freshman campaign at Coffeyville Community College, Thomas saw minimal opportunities to touch the ball as a sophomore at Michigan State. Once Dantonio arrived on campus, the coach quickly got to work on devising ways to use his receiver. \r\nBy the end of his junior campaign, Thomas not only set a school single-season record with 79 receptions and ranked second in the Big Ten Conference with 1,260 yards, but he also paced the league while ranking 11th in the nation with a 29.1-yard kickoff return average. He averaged 6.6 yards on 27 carries, finishing sixth in the NCAA ranks with an average of 199.23 all-purpose yards per game.\r\nThomas began his well-traveled football career at Huron (Ann Arbor, Mich.) High School. He transferred to Canton (Mich.) High as a junior, where he earned Detroit Free Press All-State (Division 1) honors in 2003. The second-team All-Metro choice by The Detroit News was also named to The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press All-West teams in 2003.\r\nThat season, Thomas intercepted six passes, returning one 54 yards for a touchdown vs. Livonia Churchill. He accounted for more than 1,000 all-purpose yards and 18 touchdowns, as he rushed for nearly 600 yards and had 17 receptions for 440 yards (25.9 avg).\r\nThomas enrolled at Coffeyville Community College, where he redshirted in 2004. In 2005, he ranked among the nation's top 20 junior college prospects, according to Rivals.com (No. 15) and Fab50recruiting.com. He earned second-team All-Jayhawk Conference honors as the led the Red Ravens in receptions with 33 for 674 yards (20.4 avg) and five touchdowns, finishing seventh in receiving yards in the NJCAA Region VI ranks (61.3 ypg).\r\nThomas totaled 1,161 all-purpose yards that year, ranking 10th in the region with an average of 105.5 yards per game. He returned 15 kickoffs for 339 yards (22.6 avg), adding three punt returns for 92 yards (30.7 avg), as he also gained 56 yards on five rushes (11.2 avg).\r\nIn 2006, Thomas enrolled at Michigan State. He appeared in 10 games, but managed only six receptions for 90 yards (15.0 avg) and one touchdown. He also blocked a punt that he recovered for a 17-yard return vs. Northwestern.\r\nThe second-team All-Big Ten Conference choice set the school single-season record with 79 receptions in 2007. He started all 13 games at flanker, as his 1,260 yards receiving rank third on MSU's annual record list. He had eight touchdown grabs, rushed 27 times for 177 yards (6.6 avg) and averaged 2.6 yards on seven punt returns. He attempted one pass and set a Big Ten single-season record with 1,135 yards on 39 kickoff returns (29.1 avg), as his 2,590 all-purpose yards set a school record.\r\nAfter his junior year, Thomas decided to leave MSU and applied for the 2008 NFL Draft. \r\n\"It's a done deal,\" his father, Dwight Thomas, said in an interview with the Associated Press. \"Coming off the season he had and looking at the senior corps of receivers, we felt like it was a prime opportunity for him to enter the NFL.\" \r\nThe elder Thomas said Dantonio was disappointed when informed of the decision. \"He tried to point out some reasons why he should stay for his senior year,\" Dwight Thomas said. \"I have a lot of respect for the man and appreciate what he's done for my son, but we just felt like this was the time for him to play in the NFL.\" \r\n\"We took some positive steps forward, looking to re-establish our program,\" Dantonio said. \"In one aspect, I feel like a failure as a coach because I didn't keep the team together. But on the other end of things, I feel like a success because he had a great year so he had that opportunity. We wish him the best.\"\r\nIn 23 games at Michigan State, Devin Thomas started 14 contests. He hauled in 85 passes for 1,350 yards (15.9 avg) and nine touchdowns. He also amassed 2,697 all-purpose yards. Including his time at Coffeyville College, he finished his college career with 118 catches for 2,024 yards (17.2 avg) and 14 scores. He rushed 32 times for 233 yards (7.3 avg) and totaled 127 yards on 11 punt returns (11.5 avg). He returned 54 kickoffs for 1,474 yards (27.3 avg) and piled up 3,858 all-purpose yards."

He seems to be more suited for the slot. He takes a rolling start off the snap rather than exploding off the line. However, he does shy away from contact at times, losing focus when he hears the defender closing on him. He shows good arm length to extend and pluck the ball outside his frame, but when he reverts to using his body to catch, he drops too many. He could have used another year of college football development. While he presents a nice target underneath for a quarterback, he must learn how to run crisp routes and improve his overall timing.",
                    "Negatives": "Has a very frail-looking frame with marginal strength, having to elude rather than a strong hand push in attempts to get a clean release vs. the press...Lacks explosion out of his stance and takes a bit of a rolling start and needs time to build his acceleration...Looks raw running routes deep and rounds his cuts...Tends to lose focus and drop passes that he shouldn't...Will throttle down when not involved in the play...Needs to do a better job adjusting his body going for the off-target throws and is not the most willing receiver going after the ball in a crowd...Has good size and leaping ability, but must improve his timing, as he loses more jump balls than he wins...Will get lazy and revert to body catching, resulting in drops of some easy throws...Must run with better aggression and does not have the leg drive or power to break tackles a receiver of his size should...Gives just a passive effort as a blocker and it is very rare to see him eliminate his man from the play...Sometimes runs his own pattern, breaking away from the design of the play...Has yet to prove that he has natural hands...Must do a better job with his hand placement, as he is too inconsistent using them to push off the defender in attempts to get open...Was suspended once and arrested once, leading to questions about his character...Seems to have lost his crisp cutting agility and explosive initial step he showed in high school (happened after having a metal plate and several screws placed into his surgically repaired right ankle)...Too often takes false steps before moving off the snap.\r",

                "Overview": "The arrival of new head coach Rich Rodriguez and the spread offense prompted Adrian Arrington to enter the NFL draft after just one season as a starter.\r\nArrington has had several roadblocks during his Michigan career. He missed almost all of the 2005 campaign after he suffered a broken right ankle in the season opener vs. Northern Illinois. He underwent surgery during which he had seven screws and a metal plate placed in his leg and it took him well over a year to recover from the injury.\r\nMidway through the 2006 season, Arrington was arrested on a misdemeanor domestic violence charge stemming from a fight with his girlfriend, the Detroit Free Press reported. Arrington's girlfriend, Jodi Hupe, told police they had an argument early on Oct. 13 after Arrington called her from a bar in Ypsilanti drunk and Hupe drove to pick him up. The Free Press reported the argument left Hupe with marks on her hands from keys, and that Arrington drove her car in an altered state, according to the police report. \r\nArrington continued to have problems at the university. Coach Lloyd Carr later suspended the receiver, along with two other players during 2007 spring drills due to disciplinary reasons. Carr said their return in the fall was possible but not probable. \r\nPrior to the start of 2007 fall camp, Carr brought Arrington in for a meeting. The receiver emerged from that visit as a member of the team again. \r\nAt Washington High School, Arrington was rated the fifth-best wide receiver in the country by ESPN's Tom Lemming. He was named to the Top 100 Dream Team and rated the 11th-best receiver in the country by Prep Star. Rivals.com rated him the top prospect in Iowa, giving him a four-star prospect grade. Max Emfinger rated him as the nation's sixth-best receiver and gave him a five-star prospect mark.\r\nArrington added first-team All-State honors from the Des Moines Register and the Iowa Newspaper Association. He was named the Gatorade Player of the Year for the state of Iowa as a senior and also earned first-team All-Conference and All-Metro honors. He was selected to play in the 2004 US Army All-American Game in San Antonio, Texas. As a junior, he received second-team Class 4A All-State and first-team All-Conference and All-Metro accolades.\r\nDuring his prep career, Arrington caught 100 career passes for 1,547 yards and 23 touchdowns while returning 24 kickoffs for 642 yards with one score and 38 punts for 442 yards with another touchdown. He intercepted 11 passes and made 95 tackles in his career on defense. He snatched 57 passes for 914 yards and 10 touchdowns as a senior, while also posting 29 tackles, three interceptions and two fumble recoveries.\r\nArrington grabbed 34 passes for 424 yards and five touchdown catches, along with 11 rushes for 11 yards and two touchdowns as a junior. He also made 38 tackles along with five interceptions that season. He had eight catches for 140 yards and three touchdowns along with 38 tackles and three interceptions as a sophomore, and also made one catch for nine yards as a freshman. In basketball, he was rated one of the top players in the Iowa class of 2004 and also lettered in track, where he was timed at a career-best 10.9 seconds in the 100-meters.\r\nArrington arrived on Michigan's campus as a 176-pound freshman in 2004, as the Wolverines won a recruiting battle for his services from Pittsburgh, UCLA and Iowa. He earned his first varsity letter, seeing limited action in eight games, as he caught two passes for 12 yards. The following season, Arrington suffered a right ankle fracture returning a kickoff in the season opener vs. Northern Illinois. His surgery would sideline him for the rest of the year.\r\nIn 2006, Arrington appeared in 13 games, starting at the inside slot position vs. Minnesota and Michigan State and at flanker vs. Penn State and Iowa. He ranked second on the squad with 40 receptions for 544 yards (13.8-yard average) and eight touchdowns. He also recorded one solo tackle in the Wisconsin clash.\r\nArrington was the recipient of the Desmond Howard Award in 2007, given to the team's top receiver.

                "Overview": "Professional scouts gush about the quarterbacks, running backs and wide receivers at Louisville, but Gary Barnidge is worthy of a little attention.\r\nIn his last two seasons as the full-time starter at tight end, Barnidge showed consistent skills as a receiver. His blocking needs work, but he accounted for 84 of his 98 career receptions and 11 of the 17 touchdown catches as a junior and senior.\r\nBarnidge followed in the footsteps of former Middleburg High School product and Louisville tight end Richard Owens, who played four years with the Cardinals. Barnidge played both tight end and defensive end, recorded 17 receptions and five touchdowns and was named to the Florida-Times Union Top 24 as a senior. \r\nBarnidge registered 65 tackles, 10 for a loss, three sacks, three caused fumbles, six fumble recoveries, eight quarterback pressures and one blocked kick that he returned for a touchdown that season. He also lettered in basketball, averaging 18.0 points per game.\r\nIn 2004, Barnidge enrolled at Louisville as a 215-pound tight end, turning down scholarship offers from South Florida, Louisiana-Lafayette, Mississippi and Florida. He started two of 12 games, and caught four touchdowns among his seven catches for 85 yards (12.1-yard average).\r\nAs a sophomore, Barnidge started five of 11 contests. He ranked seventh on the team with 17 catches for 240 yards (14.1-yard average), scoring twice. In 2006, Barnidge started all but the Middle Tennessee State game. He finished third on the team with 31 grabs for 511 yards (16.5 avg) and four touchdowns. He also performed well on the punt-coverage team making four solo tackles and causing one fumble.\r\nBarnidge was named All-Big East Conference first-team after a senior campaign that saw him generate 655 yards and rank second on the team with 53 receptions, including seven grabs for touchdowns. He again performed capably on special teams, causing a fumble while delivering six tackles (five solo), including two stops while playing briefly on defense.\r\nIn 47 games, Barnidge started 29 times. He caught 98 passes for 1,491 yards (15.2-yard average) and 17 touchdowns. He recovered an onside kickoff for a two-yard loss and recorded 10 tackles (nine solo) while causing two fumbles."

                "Overview": "Regarded as the \"most complete\" prospect at his respective position in the 2008 NFL Draft, Bennett combines excellent size, strength and quickness to excel not only as a clutch mid-range receiver, but also as a devastating blocker. A testament to his athletic skills was the fact that he became the first Aggie since Billy Bob Barnett in 1969 to letter in basketball and football during the same season.\r\nAfter two seasons with the hoops team at A&M, Bennett gave up basketball to concentrate on football. In addition to his duties on offense, he also appeared on the defensive line for several snaps during his senior year. He was joined on that unit by his older brother, Michael Bennett, Jr., a reserve defensive lineman for the Aggies.\r\nAt Taylor High School, Bennett was a consensus prep All-American selection. The three-year starter and a two-time All-District and All-Greater Houston choice at tight end was a member of Dave Campbell's Texas Football Super Team. He was a finalist for the Houston Touchdown Club Offensive Player of the Year  and earned first-team Class 5A All-State honors from the Texas Sports Writers Association after hauling in a team-high 42 catches for 487 yards and six touchdowns as a senior in 2004. He also grabbed four two-point conversion receptions that year.\r\nAs a junior, Bennett had 13 catches for 170 yards and two touchdowns and averaged 12.4 yards per catch during his sophomore campaign. He also lettered in basketball, picking up All-Greater Houston accolades in 2004-05. As a senior, he averaged 23 points and 8.2 rebounds per game.\r\nBennett enrolled at Texas A&M in 2005, turning down scholarship offers from Duke, Kansas, Louisiana State, Oklahoma, Texas and Southern California. He was a Freshman All-American selection by The Sporting News, as he started five of eleven games. He tallied eighteen receptions for 162 yards (9.0 avg) and three touchdowns while also recording one solo tackle.\r\nAfter his freshman campaign on the gridiron, he joined the Aggies' basketball team, seeing action in 26 games as a reserve forward. He averaged 1.9 points, shooting 12-of-46 from the field and 25-of-41 from the free throw line. He dished out twelve assists, turned the ball over seventeen times and had 40 rebounds, including eighteen off the offensive glass.\r\nBennett earned All-Big Twelve Conference first-team honors from the Dallas Morning News and was a semi-finalist for the Mackey Award, given to the nation's top tight end in 2006. He ranked second on the team with 38 receptions for 497 yards (13.1 avg) and scored three times. He also appeared in four games with the basketball team after the football season, averaging 0.5 points per game in thirteen minutes of action.\r\nThe junior tight end was having a banner 2007 season before suffering high ankle sprains (both legs) vs. Texas Tech that would sideline him for the Nebraska clash. He was named All-Big Twelve Conference second-team, as he led the team with 49 catches for 587 yards (12.0 avg) and four touchdowns. He also recovered a fumble and posted four tackles (2 solos) while pacing the Aggies with 67 knockdown blocks.\r\nWith the 2007 coaching staff having been dismissed, Bennett decided it was time to leave school and applied for the 2008 NFL Draft. \"I'm a complete player, I do it all,\" Bennett stated. \"I'm a playmaker and I always get the ball at the highest point. I'm also a great blocker. My only weakness is route running.\"\r\n\"Everything we received from the NFL as far as projections were what we wanted to hear,\" Bennett said. \"With the coaching situation it would be hard to come back for my senior season and get into a groove learning a new system.\"\r\nBennett started 23 of 36 games he appeared in at Texas A&M. He tied the school career-record for tight ends with 105 receptions (ranks tied for fifth overall), good for 1,246 yards (11.9-yard average), as his 10 touchdown grabs rank tied for eighth on the school's all-time record chart). He also recorded five tackles (3 solos) and recovered one fumble."

His suddenness off the snap ands hand technique made him an effective pass rusher and he could be in line for spot duty on both sides of the ball at the next level.\r\nDavis earned Prep Football Report and Super Prep All-American honors as a senior at Adrian High School. He was ranked among the nation's top 10 tight ends by ESPN.com's Tom Lemming (No. 4), Rivals.com (No. 7) and Super Prep (No. 8) lists and was named to Prep Football Report's, Super Prep's and Prep Star's All-Midwest teams.

He consistently graded out over 80 percent in his blocking assignments and had 25 grabs for 510 yards (20.4-yard average) and seven touchdowns as a junior.\r\nAs a true freshman at Michigan State in 2004, Davis appeared in 12 games as a reserve tight end, becoming the second family member to play for the Spartans. His brother, Josh Freeman, was a defensive end at MSU in 1995. His only reception, a 29-yarder, set up a touchdown drive vs. Illinois, as he added two solo tackles on special teams. \r\nDavis started four of 11 games as a sophomore in 2005, coming up with 15 receptions for 122 yards (8.1-yard average) and two scores, adding three solo tackles. Most people get to celebrate after a touchdown catch, but Davis could not remember his first career scoring grab, as he was knocked unconscious on the play vs. Notre Dame.\r\nIn 2006, Davis started six of eight games that he appeared in. He was arrested on Oct. 6 for a fight that resulted in a four-game suspension by the coaching staff. He missed the Michigan, Ohio State, Northwestern and Indiana games. He would go on to record three solo tackles and gain 125 yards with a touchdown on 12 catches (10.4-yard average).\r\nAs a senior, Davis earned All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention.

                "Overview": "It took the Longhorns coaching staff and even Jermichael Finley's teammates by surprise when the third-year sophomore announced after the 2007 season that he was leaving school for a chance to play in the National Football League in 2008. While he is one of the more athletic players at his position, the league's advisory board told Finley he projected as a fourth-round pick. \r\nWith a daughter at home and another child on the way, Finley decided it was time to start earning paychecks.\r\n\"The NFL is every football player's dream, and when my NFL grade came back, it was encouraging, and I felt like it was in my best interest to enter the draft,\" Finley said. \"I've worked really hard for three years at Texas to prepare for this, and I think I'm ready for the challenge.\" \r\nBased on his performance at the Combine, Finley is likely to fit in the back half of the draft. \r\nKnown for his athletic skills coming out of high school, he considered enrolling at the University of Arizona. UA was the only school to offer him a dual scholarship, hoping to entice him to the university to play both football and basketball. \r\nAt Diboll High School, Finley was a four-year starter at tight end and played defensive end, wide receiver, safety, punter and kicker. He owns the school records with 316 receptions, 30 touchdown catches and 2,217 receiving yards. He also punted for a 37.9-yard average, kicked off and played an average of 101 snaps per game. He was named District Offensive Player of the Year in football and District MVP in basketball as a sophomore, averaging 24 points and 20 rebounds as a senior for the hoops squad.\r\nFinley arrived at the University of Texas weighing 205 pounds in 2005, spending the season on the scout team. He learned the technique of playing tight end under the tutelage of former All-Big Twelve Conference selection and current New England Patriot David Thomas. Finley, who now wore Thomas' No. 16, put those lessons to use as a redshirt freshman in 2006 and established himself as one of the top Mackey Award candidates.\r\nIn 2006, he earned Freshman All-American honors, starting four of 13 games. He was the most productive freshman tight end in UT history, posting 31 catches for 372 yards (12.0-yard average) and three touchdowns, all tops on the Longhorns' freshman tight end chart. \r\nFinley received All-Big Twelve honorable mention as a sophomore in 2007. He ranked third on the team with 45 receptions for 575 yards (12.8-yard average) and two scores. His 45 grabs are the second-best season total by a Texas tight end and his 575 yards rank third on the tight end chart. He also recovered a fumble for a score and recorded a solo tackle.\r\nFinley started 17 of the 26 games in which he played at Texas. He ranks fourth on the school's career list for tight ends with 76 receptions and sixth with 947 yards (12.5-yard average), with five touchdown catches and another score on a fumble recovery."

Like Johnson, he is really more of a big possession receiver. He doesn't love to block and doesn't show great desire to combat for the ball in a crowd. He uses his body well to settle in the soft areas on the field and does a good job working back to the quarterback on broken plays. When he gets a clean release off the snap, he shows the light feet to get into his routes. Still, he needs to show better cutting agility out of his breaks. If your team has a physical blocker at this position and you're looking for a complimentary intermediate-range receiver, Keller could fill that role. If you are looking for a complete, physical blocker at the position, you might be looking elsewhere.",
                    "Negatives": "Has marginal size for the classic tight end position and is best used in a move-oriented (H-Back) formation to get the best out of his ability...Must totally revamp his blocking technique, as he spends too much time catching defenders with his hands and will generally get those hands outside his frame, allowing the opponent to make a quick move over his outside shoulder...Must do a better job of anchoring and running his feet when asked to block in-line, but he also does not possess the raw power to hold his ground firmly at the point of attack...It is not as if he lacks courage, but he does tend to shy away from contact going for the ball in a crowd...Does have concentration lapses catching the ball, as he gets off-kilter when he hears footsteps closing on the play...Has adequate hands, but would be much better if he would extend for the ball outside his frame better (lets the ball absorb into his body too much, resulting in quite a few drops when he double-catches)...Has good leaping ability, but needs to develop timing to win more jump balls (prefers to catch the ball in stride rather than reach and pluck it)...Better in the short area, as he has trouble tracking the ball in flight on deep routes (does not swivel his head well to look the ball in over his shoulder)...Also a poor cut blocker, as he fails to execute good angles to get out and neutralize second-level defenders...Can retain plays, but despite good academics and knowledge to play multiple positions, he needs more than a few reps to retain...Must improve his footwork, as he will take false steps in transition and sometimes breaks off his route too early...His weight-room strength fails to translate to the football field, as he generates just a passing hand jolt and will get held up by a strong press, as he does not get good hand placement in attempts to separate at the line of scrimmage...Has good timed speed, but runs a bit erect, lacking crisp cutting ability to come out of his breaks cleanly...Has had minor injury issues, but will play through pain (played with a shoulder tear for the second half of 2006, but still caught 37 passes in his final eight games after sustaining the injury)...Despite his quickness, he is not considered a deep threat that can challenge the secondary often (adequate cutting ability is the main culprit).\r",

                "Overview": "A semifinalist for the John Mackey Award, given to the nation's top tight end, Keller has come a long way since arriving on Purdue's campus as a 185-pound wide receiver in 2003. \r\nKeller goes down as one of the school's top tight ends and earned team Most Valuable Player honors as a senior, the first tight end to receive that honor since Dave Young in 1979.\r\nIt was sort of a natural process that brought Keller to Purdue, as most of his relatives had attended the university. His mother, Maureen, and grandmother, Linda Orr, are Purdue graduates. His grandfather, Dale Mulvey, played on the 1952 Purdue football team that won the Big Ten Conference championship. Brothers, Dwight and Drew, also attended Purdue. His great-grandfather, Robert P. Siskind, was an electrical engineering professor at the university. Purdue offered Keller its final scholarship in 2003 to keep him from signing with Toledo instead.\r\nAt Jefferson High School, Keller was named one of the top 50 receivers in the nation by Street & Smith's and added first team All-State as a senior. He was runner-up for the state's Top Receiver Award and a finalist for Indiana \"Mr. Football\" honors. He was also named Area Co-Offensive Player of the Year by the Lafayette Journal & Courier.\r\nAs a senior, Keller set state records with 113 receptions for 1,804 yards (16.0-yard average) and 22 touchdowns. He participated in basketball and track and field. He captured the state high-jump championship as senior, clearing 6'9\" in a steady rain, after finishing second his junior year with a personal best of 6'10\". \r\nThe lanky receiver spent the 2003 season with the scout team at Purdue. His body continued to develop in the weight room and he showed up at 2004 spring camp at a chiseled 235 pounds. While his new frame earned him a letter, he appeared mostly on special teams in nine contests, earning his first career start in the Ohio State game. He finished 2004 with only five catches for 102 yards (20.4-yard average), but two of those grabs were touchdowns.\r\nKeller continued his role as a reserve tight end and special teamer in 2005. A right knee sprain kept him out of the Minnesota game, as he saw action in 10 games. He grabbed 13 passes for 128 yards (9.8-yard average), finding the end zone three times.\r\nKeller cracked the starting lineup for 12 of 14 games in 2006. He earned All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention, finishing third on the team with 56 receptions for 771 yards (13.4-yard average) and four touchdowns. He had one solo tackles and gained 39 yards on three kickoff returns (13.0 avg). An right shoulder (AC joint tear) injury suffered in October would hamper him the second half of the season, but he toughed it out, playing in every game. After his junior campaign, he underwent surgery to repair the shoulder damage.\r\nAt 248 pounds, Keller was ready to establish himself among the nation's top tight ends in 2007. He was an All-American honorable mention by Pro Football Weekly, team MVP and All-Big Ten Conference second-team choice. He hauled in a career-high 68 passes for 881 yards (13.0-yard average) and seven touchdowns, also scoring on a fumbled rushing attempt while making three solo tackles and returning a kickoff 15 yards. He ranked fourth nationally among tight ends with an average of 5.23 receptions per game and fifth with 67.77 receiving yards per game. His 68 receptions are the second-most in school history among tight ends, while his 731 yards rank third. \r\nIn 46 games at Purdue, Keller started 26 contests. He hauled in 142 passes for 1,882 yards (13.3-yard average) and 16 touchdowns. He recovered a rushing attempt in the end zone for a score, posted four solo tackles and gained 54 yards on four kickoff returns, finishing with 102 points scored and an average of 42.09 all-purpose yards per game."

                    "Negatives": "Has good straight-line quickness out of his stance, but needs to refine his footwork, as he is too inconsistent with his kick slide to get back and mirror edge rushers (has a tendency to get up on his toes in pass protection, as the more physical defenders capitalize on this to rock him back on his heels)...Might be a better fit at right tackle or inside at guard, as he lacks the hip snap and lateral movement to get out in front and impact block for perimeter runs...Has a decent hand punch, but will sometimes revert to \"short arming\" and needs to be consistent with his arm extension and hand placement in attempts to sustain and finish his blocks...Because of his adequate lateral agility, he has problems when defenders cross his face...Though he can make downfield blocks, his lumbering running style makes him best at the point of attack, widening the rush lane rather than on pulls and traps...Loses some steam late in games and will revert to bending at the waist, causing him to narrow his base and struggle to maintain contact with defenders...Needs to improve his angles on the move, as he does not always locate his target when working in space...Slow at times to generate pop coming out of his stance, as he does not always get his weight out in front of him...Susceptible to spin moves and counters when he is slow to set his feet...When he gets too high in his stance, he can be rocked back on his heels when trying to prevent the bull rush, but does regain his anchor...Has had relative success facing smaller defenders, but in his last 23 games, his opponents have had a serious weight disadvantage vs. him (his main blocking assignment averaged less that 258 pounds and he faced only three defensive ends that weighed over 280 during that span)...Had his two worst performances in 2007 after being named an All-American, but he was also battling an ankle injury...Was suspended briefly for disciplinary issues early in the season.\r",

                "Overview": "It was short, but the college career for Anthony Collins at Kansas was productive.\r\nHe excelled playing left offensive tackle for a team that nearly played for the national title in 2007. Having just one year of football experience under his belt when he enrolled at the university, he would go on to start in two of his three campaigns with the Jayhawks, lining up at right tackle during his sophomore campaign.\r\nWith his recent success on the college gridiron, Collins decided to leave Kansas for the professional ranks, applying for the 2008 NFL Draft. \"I'm done with KU,\" Collins said in early January. \"I loved every minute of it. I enjoyed my time here. I enjoyed working under coach {Mark} Mangino. I felt like there was nothing else to prove. I felt like I need to get better at the next level.\"\r\nCollins said he hopes to be a first- or second-round pick, and is thrilled about joining KU junior Aqib Talib in declaring early for the NFL Draft. He said leaving early wasn't a hard decision for him. \r\nAt Beaumont Central High School, Collins played just one season of varsity football. As a senior, he started at strong-side defensive end. He earned Class 4A All-District and All-State honors, helping Central to a regional championship. He was also named to the Super Gold Team in 2003.\r\nCollins turned down scholarship offers from McNeese State, Southern University, Iowa State and Houston, enrolling at Kansas in 2004. He did not play that season, working as a defensive lineman on the scout team. Collins shifted to the offensive line prior to the 2005 season, appearing in eight games behind Matt Thompson at right tackle. He earned his first career start at that position vs. Missouri.\r\nAs a sophomore, Collins took over right offensive tackle duties. He helped the offense average 374.2 yards per game, as he earned Associated Press All-Big Twelve Conference honorable mention. He averaged 5.33 knockdown blocks (64 total) per game while playing in 12 games.\r\nIn 2007, Collins shifted to left tackle. He was a finalist for the Outland Trophy and garnered consensus All-American first-team accolades, despite sitting out the first series of the Toledo game due to a disciplinary issue and missing the Iowa State game with a right ankle sprain. He delivered 108 knockdowns with 15 touchdown-resulting blocks for an offense that generated 479.8 yards per game."

He is good on short pulls, but his legs will give out on long-distance runs. He made marked improvement at right tackle in 2007, where he did not have to be stationed out on the island all the time. Still, he lacks the size, bulk and balance you need to make the reach blocks from the outside. Look for Cousins' athletic promise to get him drafted earlier than his production dictates.",
                    "Negatives": "Has excellent athletic ability, but his playing performance lacks overall consistency...Needs to add at least another 25 pounds to his frame for a potential move to guard at the next level...Has room on his frame to add that bulk, but it could impact his rare timed speed...As good as his timed speed is, he fails to show that explosiveness late in games (feet will go out from under him on long pulls)...Best blocking at the X's or in the short area, as he will struggle with balance and redirection when having to go long distances...More of a waist bender and needs to play lower in his pads to prevent defenders from having success standing him up and pushing him back into the pocket...Improved his ability to take angles, but is more of a reach-and-grab blocker, as he doesn't use his hand strength to strike and recoil with force...Showed better urgency in his play as a senior, but was known for throttling down or failing to finish as a junior (would get frustrated and bail on the play when his initial move failed, resulting in his eventual benching for the second half of 2006)...Was more active with his hands as a senior, but still struggles to mirror and get placement when taking on speed rushers, making him a better candidate for an interior line position...Loses balance when he has to redirect and needs to keep his pads down and bend at the knees better when taking on the bull rush...Takes well to hard coaching, but needs a patient mentor, as he will more likely make his fourth position move (to guard) in four seasons...Despite his impressive timed speed, he lacks that initial step burst needed to fit on a defender...Must wheel his hips better when attempting to slide and needs to work harder trying to cave defenders once he lets his body go...Has good field smarts, but is not always quick to recognize games up front.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a wide frame with good chest muscles, long arms, wide waist and hips, but his hands are smaller than ideal...Has rare timed speed for his position, but needs to show it more consistently on the football field...Hard worker who has had to make more than several position moves during his career, but has been quick to grasp the concept of his new role, showing the ability to easily grasp a complicated playbook... When he keeps his pad level down and head up, he gets a good burst off the snap to gain movement off the ball (consistency is lacking, though)...Showed a better feel for taking angles working into the second level as a senior than he did previously...Also began to show a more aggressive nature, playing with more fire in his belly (no longer takes passive arm swipes and now works to finish)...Still needs to upgrade his hand punch and placement, but when he does uncoil his hands he can rock the defenders back on their heels...Still bodies up and tries to out-wrestle an opponent, but did a much better job of letting the action come to him as a senior rather than over-extend and lunge as his man... Was much more alert to stunts and twists as a senior than in the past, showing good torque to catch on contact...Has better quickness now in his pass set since he learned to play with a wider base...Not really explosive as a cut blocker, but has had good success generating short-area explosion needed to widen the rush lane...Works well with his guards on combo blocks, showing better body control on contact and the ability to sustain and drive until the whistle (better when working in unison with another blocker than in one-on-one matchups, making him a better fit at guard)...Has better equilibrium working at the X's than in space, but even though his knee bend still needs improvement, he did a better job reacting to counter moves in 2007 ...Better as an in-line blocker, as he has the ability to drive and generate the good base he needs to anchor...When he gets his hands on a defender (improving, but still inconsistent) he can control and adjust to counter moves...His anchor improved dramatically as a senior and will only get better if he improves his knee bend...Shows better ability with his cut blocks on second-level defenders now, as he has a good concept for taking angles and knows how to throw his hands to shock and jolt...Has the functional hip snap to adjust to moving targets, but needs to stay in control and wait for the action to come to him...With his long arms, he has done an efficient job of using them to engulf smaller defenders.

Even though his technique is raw, many experts feel that with patient coaching he could elevate his play at the next level, much like the Colts' Tony Ugoh did coming out of Arkansas after the 2006 season.\r\nBorn on the island of Jamaica, Cousins came to the United States as a teenager, bouncing from coast to coast, with stops in Brooklyn, New York and Fullerton, California. He never even saw a football game until his high school sophomore year, having played soccer as a child. With his rare timed speed and success on traps and sweeps, he could find himself moving again in the pros, with a potential shift to offensive guard.\r\nCousins lettered three times on the gridiron at Eastside Christian High School. He earned first-team All-CIF honors as a defensive lineman and was the team's Defensive MVP as a senior, splitting his time on both lines in addition to competing as a linebacker. That year, he collected 108 tackles with 10 sacks and two fumble recoveries. He had at least 10 tackles in five contests, including 22 vs. Liberty Christian High. He also posted four sacks in the Skyward Christian High clash.\r\nCousins added All-CIF defensive accolades as a junior, also seeing starting action as an offensive tackle. He was an honorable mention All-CIF defensive lineman as a sophomore, but also started on the offensive line. He earned All-Conference Southern Section and All-CIF honors in basketball and twice received school academic awards. \r\nIn 2003, Cousins enrolled at Texas-El Paso, competing on the scout team as a defensive tackle. He appeared in two games (wore jersey #72) as a reserve defensive tackle in 2005, recording a solo tackle in the New Mexico State clash. He was moved to the offensive line in 2005, appearing in eight games as the backup to Josh House at left offensive tackle.\r\nCousins replaced House in the starting lineup at left tackle in 2006. He manned that position for the first eight games, but was then replaced in the lineup after struggling with the pass rush. The coaching staff shifted him to right tackle in 2007 and saw a remarkable improvement in his play. He went on to earn All-Conference USA first-team honors, as he posted 78 knockdown blocks and graded 82.3 percent for blocking consistency, allowing just three sacks on 440 pass plays.\r\n\"His (Cousins) football background was very limited, then he was a defensive lineman for two years,\" offensive tackles coach Jeff Woodruff said. \"Offensive line experience, he didn't have a ton. Now he's gone from being not on the list to a first-day draft pick. \"He's so much improved over a year ago. He's playing with a lot of confidence now, being physical, being athletic. He's been a jewel to work with, a great kid who wants to be good and wants to do it right.\" \r\n\"He's got so much upside,\" head coach Mike Price said. \"He's not like a lot of guys who've played offensive line since Pop Warner. He doesn't have all the experiences like other offensive linemen. There's still plays Oniel hasn't seen, some pass rushes he hasn't seen. But he's tough, smart, talented, athletic, he can run, he has good feet, he's got everything except experience.\""

                "Overview": "Playing in the shadows of All-American offensive tackle Chad Rinehart, Keith actually developed into a better athlete than his more heralded teammate. The massive drive blocker with an incredibly long wing span and hands the size of baseball mitts has excellent quickness for a player his size.\r\nNeeding to dispel concerns about his character and work ethic, it was commonplace to see Keith be the first player at the team facilities in the mornings, working on a cardio program that kept his weight in check and helped improve his overall flexibility. \r\nBlessed with natural strength, he produced one of the better performances in the weight room at the NFL Combine, putting up 225 pounds 31 times. In a recent workout for NFL teams on campus, he clocked 4.98 seconds in the 40-yard dash and produced a 32-inch vertical jump with a 9'5\" broad jump. That is impressive for any athlete, much less one of his size.\r\nAt McAlester High School, Keith was rated the second-best player in the state of Oklahoma by Rivals.com in 2002, who also rated him the 20th-best offensive tackle in the country. He earned first-team All-State honors from the Daily Oklahoman and the Tulsa World in 2002.\r\nThat year, Keith tallied more than 70 pancake blocks, helping the team compile an 11-1 record on the way to playing in the state semifinals. The team also went 8-4 and reached the second round of the playoffs during his junior campaign.\r\nRecruited by Texas A&M, Florida and Nebraska, Keith enrolled at Oklahoma University in 2003, but left the left before the season. He enrolled at Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College that year, spending two seasons at the school, playing for the football team in 2004. That season, he garnered NJCAA All-American second-team honors.\r\nHaving left Oklahoma once, the Sooners coaches were a bit reluctant to let Keith return to the team in 2005, remembering the issues they had with him in 2003. Those character issues were again front-and-center that season, as he became increasingly frustrated about not playing. He was suspended and requested a release from the program, leaving Oklahoma without ever suiting up for the university.\r\nKeith transferred to Northern Iowa, where he was eligible to play in 2006. He played in a total of seven games, starting at right tackle in two contests, but a right knee bone bruise would sideline him for the rest of the year.\r\nAs a senior, Keith earned All-Gateway Conference first-team and Associated Press third-team All-American honors. He started 11 of 13 games at right tackle, grading 81.8 percent for blocking consistency, as he registered 71 knockdowns with 11 touchdown-resulting blocks.\r\nStill, his time at NIU was not without drama. He had an issue with the training staff after missing a rehabilitation workout in 2006. Tempers were soothed when it was revealed that the reason for his absence was due to the death of his grandmother. After a stellar performance at the NFL Combine in February, followed by an early March Pro Day workout that was just short of sensational, Keith's draft stock continued to soar.\r\nThen, in mid-March, Keith was arrested along with two other Northern Iowa football players. He was charged with rioting, disorderly conduct and interference with official acts in the incident at a local rental facility that can be used for private events. Officers from the Cedar Falls, Waterloo and University of Northern Iowa police departments, and the Black Hawk County Sheriff's Department responded to numerous fights in progress inside and outside the Main Event Center, in Cedar Falls, according to the Cedar Falls Police Department."

When he keeps his pads down and generates good hip roll, he creates good movement to create another line of scrimmage...Runs his feet well in attempts to finish blocks and knows how to use his size to wall off his opponent, doing a better job of maintaining inside leverage and readjusting back than most bigger blockers...Stays on his feet upon initial contact and can generated a strong punch with either hand rising out of his stance...Determined drive blocker with the natural strength to consistently drive through and knock down defenders, as he aggressively attacks his man until the whistle...When he extends and uses his hands to lock up and sustain, the battle is quickly over...Can slide his feet adequately in the short area (will struggle to adjust in the second level) and is not the type who will rely on his big frame to lean into a defender (loves to face up and maul rather than sit back and wait for the action.\r"

College Football News ranked Nicks as the sixth-best junior college offensive lineman in the country, and the 25th-best junior college prospect in the nation. Nicks is ranked No. 9 on the SuperPrep JUCO 100. Nicks chose the Huskers after also receiving offers from California, Washington, Wisconsin and Louisville. Nicks also threw shot put and discus for Hartnell.",
                "Overview": "The well traveled offensive lineman finally found a home with the Huskers, stationing himself at the demanding left tackle position as a senior, his only season as a starter. With his massive frame, long wing span and aggressive nature, it was commonplace to see defensive linemen engulfed by Nicks on a regular basis.\r\nFor a player of his size, he is quite effective at getting out in front on drive blocks. Some professional teams feel he might have to shift to right tackle at the next level to compensate for a lack of ideal foot speed to be isolated on the edge vs. speedy pass rushers, but in 481 pass plays during his final campaign, he allowed just one sack and one pressure.\r\nAt North Salinas High School, Nicks was a standout defensive tackle, playing at a mere 280 pounds. He earned All-County honors from the Monterey Herald and was a first-team All-Area choice. He added All-Tri County Athletic League first-team accolades and was named the league's Defensive Lineman of the Year in 2002.\r\nNicks enrolled at New Mexico State in 2003, appearing in five games as a reserve defensive tackle. He recorded three tackles with a stop behind the line of scrimmage and also recovered a fumble. He entered 2004 spring camp about to make the move to offensive guard, but academic problems forced him to transfer to Hartnell Junior College the following season.\r\nAt Harnell College, Nicks earned 2005 California Community College Football Coaches Association first-team All-American honors and Region II first-team All-California accolades as an offensive lineman while playing for head coach Larry Souza. Nicks also was named a third-team JC-Gridwire/JCFootball.com All-American, as he helped lead Hartnell to a 7-4 record and a conference championship. He received a four-star rating from Scout.com and Rivals.com, which listed him as the 35th-best junior college prospect in the country.  He also competed on the track team in the shot put and discus.\r\nNicks then enrolled at Nebraska in 2006, where he served as a valuable \"sixth man\" on the offensive line. He also performed on the PAT and field goal units. Late in the season, he earned a pair of starts vs. Colorado and Oklahoma at right tackle.\r\nNicks earned second-team All-Big 12 Conference recognition as a senior for the Huskers in 2006. He started 11 games at left tackle, coming off the bench vs. Kansas State after being suspended for the first quarter of that contest due to disciplinary reasons. Despite general struggles by the team, Nicks provided excellent pass protection as the Nebraska quarterbacks completed a school single-season record 296 passes. \r\nIn his only season as a starter, Nicks allowed just one sack and one pressure on 481 pass plays. He registered 76 knockdowns, coming up with key blocks on 14 touchdown drives as he finished the year with an 83.4 percent grade for blocking consistency."

He has excellent hand punch and upper body strength, but needs to get a strong lower base to anchor better vs. the bull rush. He simply flattens people when he shoots his hands into the defender and it is his hand usage that helps compensate for lower body strength deficiencies. With experience at offensive guard, he could convert to that position at the next level, as he is a bit tall for a center. Indianapolis had great success in converting Jake Scott to guard and there are a lot of similarities in body style between Scott and Richard. Few centers have a feel for coverages like he showed as a senior. Look for him to be a nice mid-round find on draft day with a high ceiling awaiting him in the NFL.",

Will recoil in a hurry when he keeps his hands inside his frame (hands are his best asset) and is also effective at finesse blocking, using his hands to turn and steer the defender...Has enough lateral quickness to slide either way and help out his guards with a second move (just a bit inconsistent changing direction vs. the power rush).\r"

Possessing great strength and toughness in the trenches, he is also a versatile blocker with experience at the guard position. \r\nNamed the team's Top Offensive Lineman the last three years, Richard has also excelled in the classroom, earning league academic accolades. He was also a semifinalist for the National Football Foundation's Draddy Award, nicknamed the academic Heisman, for his combination of academic and athletic performance.\r\nRichard was a dominating two-way tackle at Weston High School, earning All-State, All-Area and All-Conference honors as a senior. He served as team captain that year and lettered three seasons on the gridiron. The left offensive tackle registered 95 tackles with 12.5 sacks from the strong-side defensive tackle slot in his final year.\r\nRichard enrolled at Buffalo in 2003, as he became just the second player in Weston High annals to earn a Division I-A scholarship. He spent that season on the scout team, adjusting to playing center. The following year, he appeared in seven contests, earning starting assignments in the pivot vs. Akron and Miami (Oh.) while paving the way for a pair of 200-yard rushing performances.\r\nThe 2005 season saw Richard firmly entrenched at center, starting all 11 games. One of three offensive linemen to start every game, the team amassed 986 of its 1,119 yards rushing through the middle of its front wall. \r\nAs a junior, Richard served as team captain, as he was the recipient of the squad's 'U Believe' Award, given to the most outstanding offensive lineman, as well as the Dominic Grossi Award presented to the UB football player who has displayed athletic prowess, academic excellence and sportsmanship. He went on to post 79 knockdowns and grade 82.4 percent for blocking consistency while helping the team total 3,218 yards in total offense through 12 contests.\r\nRichard was named to The NFL Draft Report's 2007 Super Sleeper Team, adding second-team All-Mid American Conference honors.

                "Overview": "One of the strongest centers in the college game, Wallace boasts a 480-pound bench press, a 374-pound hang clean and a school record 740-pound squat. He combines a good blend of power and short-area explosiveness to be a violent blocker along the line of scrimmage. His combative nature in the trenches has old-time scouts comparing his style of play to former Buffalo Bills great Jim Ringo and Kansas City's Tim Grunhard.\r\nWith his upper body strength, Wallace has had considerable success in controlling defenders, showing the ability to instantly attack his opponent after snapping the ball. He also shows enough short-area foot quickness to mirror pass rushers when sliding back to protect the pocket. \r\nAt Cuero High School, Wallace was a standout powerlifter, advancing to the state finals in that sport. He was a versatile football player, competing at center, tackle and guard during his career, in addition to playing on the defensive front wall as a senior, where he recorded 45 tackles. He was a two-time Class 3A All-State gridiron selection and consensus Texas Top 100 choice. He registered more than 100 knockdown blocks in each of his junior and senior seasons.\r\nWallace spent the 2003 season redshirting and competing on the scout team at Texas A&M. He saw brief action in five games as a strong-side offensive guard during the 2004 season before taking over center duties the following campaign. \r\nIn 2005, he helped pave the way for one of the most prolific offenses in school history. That unit averaged 442.3 yards of total offense per game, which ranks second in Aggies annals. The team also rushed for 234.9 yards per game, which was A&M's best rushing effort since 1991.\r\nAs a junior, Wallace earned first-team All-Big 12 Conference honors after starting all 13 games for the Aggies. The team captain helped the squad generate 397.4 yards of total offense per game, including a league-best 206.8 rushing yards per game. He finished with 121 knockdowns and 11 touchdown-resulting blocks, but was also penalized seven times.\r\nWallace was a finalist for the Rimington Award in 2007, given to the nation's top center. His stellar offensive line play helped the Aggies rack up 4,883 yards of total offense (402.8 avg) and score 346 points (28.8 ppg). The All-Big 12 Conference first-team choice was also named the league co-Offensive Lineman of the Year, in addition to picking up Academic All-American accolades. He delivered 131 knockdowns and graded 83.85 percent for blocking consistency.\r\n\"Cody Wallace is a phenomenal football player and a phenomenal young man,\" Aggie offensive line coach Jim Bob Helduser said. \"He's been a pleasure, a joy and a blessing to work with for the past five years.

                "Overview": "An unheralded player with the versatility to play any position in the secondary, Charles Godfrey emerged as one of the few bright spots on the Hawkeyes' defense in 2007.\r\nFacing some of the best receivers in the country, his main pass coverage assignments accounted for just 15 receptions for 117 yards (7.8-yard average) and no touchdowns during his final season at Iowa.\r\nGodfrey flew under the radar for most of his college career, but the Iowa coaching staff regarded him as a vital cog in the Hawkeyes' defensive scheme. He began playing for the Hawkeyes as a reserve free safety, shifting to strong safety as a sophomore. With the departure of the entire Iowa secondary after the 2005 campaign, Godfrey shifted to right cornerback as a junior, starting at that position during his final two seasons.\r\nGodfrey earned first-team All-Greater Houston and All-Conference as a senior at Robert E. Lee High School, along with Class 5A honorable mention All-State. He was named Defensive Player of the Year as a senior and selected to play in the Global Junior All-Star Game and the Bayou Bowl. He led his team to an 11-2 record, as he recorded 90 tackles, two interceptions, six pass break-ups and two blocked punts as a senior. He also returned kicks and had a 31.5 yard average. \r\nThe brother of former Kansas State star quarterback El Roberson, Godfrey rejected a scholarship offer from the Wildcats to enroll at Iowa in 2004. One of three true freshmen to letter, he appeared 11 games behind Sean Considine (Philadelphia) at free safety, posting 10 tackles (seven solo) while recovering two fumbles.\r\nIn 2005, Godfrey shifted to strong safety, starting twice at that position while also filling in at free safety vs. Illinois. He registered 35 tackles (27 solo) with a stop for a loss in 11 games, as he also caused one fumble, earning Reggie Roby Special Teams Player of the Year honors.\r\nGodfrey shifted to right cornerback in 2006, but still excelled on special teams with the punt team. The team's Special Teams Hustle Award winner posted 83 tackles (61 solo), the third-best total on the team. He had two stops for losses, a forced fumble, one fumble recovery and two interceptions. He also broke up five passes.\r\nAs a senior right cornerback, Godfrey garnered All-American honorable mention and All-Big Ten Conference second-team accolades. He started all 12 games, ranking fifth on the squad with 65 tackles (42 solo) and a stop for a loss. He intercepted five passes and broke up nine others.\r\nIn 47 games at Iowa, Godfrey earned 28 starting assignments, with 25 coming at right cornerback, two at strong safety and one at free safety. He recorded 193 tackles (137 solos) with four stops for losses of six yards, three fumble recoveries and a pair of forced fumbles. He deflected 14 passes and gained 38 yards on seven interception returns."

                "Overview": "The long road to the National Football League continues to get longer for Ikegwuonu. More than a year after Jack and his twin brother, William, were arrested on residential burglary and criminal trespass charges, the two are still battling through the legal system to attain a resolution to their cases. The Badger cornerback had a subpar 2007 campaign on the football field that was the result of inconsistent play, legal distractions and injuries.\r\nHe later surprised the Wisconsin football staff by making the decision to leave school and apply for the NFL Draft. Once touted as the best cornerback in the college ranks, he saw his potential first-round projection continue to slide throughout his final year in Madison. \r\nNow, further clouding his professional future is a serious right knee injury he suffered working out while preparing for the NFL Combine. Ikegwuonu tore the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in his right knee during workouts in late January. Doctors indicate he will be forced to miss the entire 2008 season.  \r\nAccording to reports, Ikegwuonu also suffered damage to his kneecap. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported Ikegwuonu was pulling a sled in a drill designed to improve his speed when the injury occurred. He exploded out of a start and planted his leg when the knee gave way. \r\nIkegwuonu needed a strong performance at the NFL Combine, as well as in individual workouts, to ensure he would be selected in the first three rounds of the draft. \"I blame the agent for telling him to come out, when we told him to stay in,\" one NFL scout said.\r\nA local product, Ikegwuonu was a first-team All-State selection by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and Associated Press as a split end at Memorial High School. He added All-State honors as a defensive back by the Wisconsin Football Coaches Association. He was also an All-Midwest Region selection by Prep Star, adding All-Area accolades and Big Eight Conference Wide Receiver and Defensive Back of the Year honors in 2003.\r\nAs a senior, Ikegwuonu caught 38 passes for 1,000 yards and 15 touchdowns, while making 40 solo tackles and intercepting nine passes on defense. An All-Conference return specialist as a junior, he was a two-time team MVP. He also lettered in basketball and baseball and was an All-area and All-Conference centerfielder. He was also a member of the school's academic honor roll as a junior.\r\nIkegwuonu enrolled at Wisconsin in 2004, spending the season red-shirting as his brother enrolled at Northern Illinois. The following season, he shared left cornerback duties with Allen Langford, starting four of 13 contests. He earned Freshman All-American honorable mention, as he produced 26 tackles (23 solos) with two stops for losses and three pass deflections. He also returned one of three interceptions for a touchdown.\r\nAs a sophomore, Ikegwuonu was an All-American honorable mention and All-Big Ten Conference first-team choice. He switched to right cornerback, starting every game while also changing to jersey #6 from #27. He was suspended in December after his arrest, but quickly reinstated before the Citrus Bowl. He registered 41 tackles (35 solos) with 3.5 stops for losses, as he caused a fumble and recovered another for a touchdown. He broke up 11 passes and picked off two others.\r\nDespite an inconsistent 2007 season, Ikegwuonu earned first-team All-Big Ten Conference status. He started 13 games at right cornerback, but missed most of The Citadel clash with an upper thigh bruise and most of the Michigan State contests with flu-like symptoms and a migraine headache. He finished his final season with just 24 tackles (19 solos), an interception and 15 pass break-ups.\r\nIn 39 games at Wisconsin, Ikegwuonu started 30 times -- 26 at right cornerback, three at left cornerback and one at nickel back. He finished with 91 tackles (77 solos), 5.5 stops for losses of 20 yards and a forced fumble. He returned a fumble recovery 50 yards for a score and gained 89 yards with a touchdown on six interception returns. He also deflected 29 passes."

Both have been productive returners and Porter shows good ability as a gunner on special teams. Neither is known for tackling ability, or a desire to make plays vs. the run. Porter is rail-thin, but additional weight would take away his best quality -- speed. He lacks consistency recognizing the play as it develops and will never be more than marginal in run support.

                "Overview": "One of the nation's top playmaking defensive backs, Tracy Porter became the first player in school history to return a punt, interception and fumble for touchdowns in his career. \r\nThe team captain has always been known for his ball-hawking skills, but after years of reluctance to perform vs. the run, Porter showed good determination in stopping the run his final season.\r\nAs a senior, Porter became the first Hoosier since Mark Sutor in 1982 to record six or more interceptions in a season. He would close out his career with 16 interceptions, three short of the school record of 19 by Tim Wilbur (1978-82). Ever the opportunist, he amassed 413 yards on those interception returns, breaking the previous Indiana record of 360 yards by Wilbur. He also became just the third player in Big Ten Conference history to gain over 400 yards on interception returns, joining Jamar Fletcher of Wisconsin (459, 1998-2000) and Tom Curtis of Michigan (431, 1967-69).\r\nIt took a few years for Porter to warm up to playing football. At Port Allen High School, he was more noted for his basketball talent than for his football prowess. He played only two seasons of football during his prep days, but earned first-team All-District 3A honors as a senior and second-team laurels as a junior.\r\nPorter played quarterback, running back and wide receiver on offense and made 93 tackles, 11 interceptions (two returned for touchdowns) and 14 pass breakups as a cornerback during his senior year. He also returned two punts and two kickoffs for touchdowns, averaging 47.0 yards per kick return and 28.0 per punt return. He also started at point guard for the basketball team and clocked a personal best 10.4 in the 100 meters for the track team.\r\nPorter joined Leslie Majors as the only true freshmen to letter at Indiana in 2004. He was named to The Sporting News' Big Ten Conference All-Freshman Team. He started the first seven games at right cornerback before he was sidelined for the final four contests with a left shoulder injury (clavicle fracture). He posted 22 tackles (19 solo) with six pass breakups and also intercepted three passes, returning one for a touchdown.\r\nAs a sophomore, Porter started all 11 games, 10 at right cornerback, and in the season finale vs. Purdue, he shifted to strong safety. He delivered 48 tackles (42 solo) with a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. He picked off three more passes and also batted away six other throws.\r\nPorter added punt return duties to his resume in 2006. He was a second-team All-Big Ten Conference pick, starting all 12 games at right cornerback. He was in on 59 tackles (51 solos), as he recovered a fumble, caused another and knocked down eight balls. He had four interceptions and a 27-yard kickoff return while also blocking one kick. \r\nIn 2007 preseason camps, Porter excelled and the coaching staff felt that he had the ability to be the Big Ten's elite cornerback. Coach Bill Lynch was impressed by Porter's play and maturity and predicted a big year.\r\nIn 2007, Porter became the first Indiana cornerback since Mike Dumas in 1989 to earn All-Big Ten Conference first-team accolades. He shifted to left cornerback, ranking second in the league and tied for 18th nationally with six interceptions. He ranked tied for third in the Big Ten with an 11.0-yard average on 23 punt returns. He totaled 83 tackles (63 solo), with a sack and 5.5 stops for losses. He recovered two fumbles, returning one for a score and had four pass breakups.\r\nPorter started all 43 games in which he played at Indiana, lining up at right cornerback for 29 contests, at left cornerback for 13 games and once at strong safety. He ranks second in school history with 16 interceptions for a Hoosiers all-time record 413 yards in returns (25.8-yard average) and a touchdown. He recovered four fumbles for 147 yards in returns, including a score. He added 477 yards and a touchdown on 35 punt returns (13.6 avg) and had a 27-yard kickoff return. He finished with 212 tackles (175 solo), a nine-yard sack and 5.5 stops for minus-18 yards. He also caused two fumbles, deflected 24 passes and blocked a kick."

He has been a bit of a project with coaches working to prod Talib to mature, and he showed signs of maturation as a junior. Like Rolle, he does not have the timed speed you look for to handle the blazing receivers on deep routes and he does gamble more than he should (gives a big cushion), seeing more than 51% of the passes thrown his way get caught by the opposition last year (47-of-92). He needs to continue to show that he can play within the system and let his play do the talking on the field at the next level.

                "Overview": "One of the best shutdown cornerbacks in the collegiate ranks, Aqib Talib has shown marked improvement and dramatically improved his work ethic and approach to the game since he was suspended early in the 2006 season. \r\nA player who came to Kansas with a self-described poor work habits, Talib showed some signs of immaturity during his first season, when he redshirted.\r\n\"That was a very immature person as far as the workout schedule and everything,\" said Talib. \"I was just kind of immature and on my own schedule, like 'I'll get on the Stairmaster and not lift weights.' It was me not knowing what I had a chance to do. It was just me being very young and not thinking.\"\r\nAfter applying himself off the field, his play elevated him among the elite players in the game, going on to start 32 of his final 34 contests. In just three seasons, he recorded 162 tackles (126 solo) and deflected 43 passes. \r\nHis 13 interceptions rank second in school history, with a KU career record 322 yards in returns and a pair of touchdowns. His 322 return yards also rank second in Big Twelve Conference annals. To further highlight his \"new attitude,\" he also developed into an offensive weapon, as five of his nine receptions resulted in touchdowns.\r\nAt Berkner High School, Talib earned first-team All-District and All-City honors and was named the Defensive Back of the Year for Berkner as a senior. As a junior, he returned an interception for a 99-yard touchdown. In addition, he lettered in basketball and track.\r\nIn 2004, Talib turned down scholarship offers from Kansas State, Wyoming, Tulsa, Arizona and Baylor to enroll at Kansas. He spent the season competing on the scout team. He and Kansas offensive tackle Anthony Collins earned extra money cleaning stoves and refrigerators in dorms on campus.\r\nThe following year, Talib started nine of 11 games at right cornerback, earning Freshman All-American honors from Rivals.com and was named to The Sporting News' Freshman All-Big Twelve Conference team. Wearing jersey No. 28, he picked off two passes, deflected eight others and ranked sixth on the squad with 54 tackles (45 solo). Showing the strength to stack and control inside the box, he caused two fumbles, had four stops behind the line of scrimmage and recovered a fumble that he advanced six yards.\r\nDuring 2006 fall camp, Talib was suspended by the coaching staff. He returned to the lineup wearing jersey No. 3 for his final 10 games after sitting out vs. Northwestern State and Louisiana-Monroe. He would go on to lead the nation with 22 pass breakups, as he also intercepted six other throws. He posted 42 tackles (39 solo) with two stops for losses and a fumble recovery. He also saw his first action as a receiver, registering a 42-yard touchdown on his only reception.\r\nThe consensus All-American and unanimous All-Big Twelve Conference first-team pick was also a finalist for the Nagurski Award (National Defensive Player of the Year) and a semi-finalist for the Thorpe Award (nation's top defensive back). He registered 66 tackles (42 solos) with 3.5 stops for losses. From his left cornerback position, he posted 13 pass deflections and gained 195 yards with two touchdowns on five interceptions. He also snared eight passes for 182 yards (22.8-yard average) and four scores, adding 21 yards on a pair of punt returns.\r\nIn 34 games at Kansas, Talib started 32 contests. He produced 162 tackles (126 solos) with 9.5 stops for losses of 19 yards and one quarterback pressure. He recovered two fumbles, advancing one six yards and also had a pair of forced fumbles. He deflected 43 passes and amassed 322 yards with two touchdowns on 13 interception returns (24.8-yard average). He hauled in nine passes for 224 yards (24.9 avg) and five scores, returned two punts for 21 yards (10.5 avg) and carried once for a 6-yard loss."

                    "Compares To": "JACQUES REEVES-Dallas...In the NFL, the left cornerback needs to be a shutdown type, as he will generally face the opposition's best receiver. He also needs to be a physical tackler, especially in run force, something that Williams has yet to display. He is strong in man coverage and can run stride for stride with receivers on long routes. Like Reeves, he might bring better value as a key performer in sub packages. Even with his 16 interceptions, his hands are only adequate. What he does well is anticipate the receiver's progression through the route. He gets a good break on the ball, but is more of a drag-down tackler, like Cowboys' cornerbacks Reeves and Terence Newman.",
                    "Negatives": "Has just adequate strength and lacks ideal size, as he struggles to handle bigger and stronger receivers...Needs to generate a stronger hand placement, as lacks pop in attempts to jam the receiver at the line of scrimmage...Does not hit with authority and is more of a drag-down type than a wrap-up tackler...Shows willingness vs. the run, but lacks the sand in his pants to prevent blockers from washing him out of the play...Has good leaping ability, but needs to time jumps better, as he will stop his feet, getting up before the ball reaches its high point...Despite his 16 interceptions, he lacks natural hands and has converted a few more interceptions into deflections by not fielding the ball cleanly...Spends too much time trying to slip past blockers in run support and becomes a non-factor on the play (must stack and control better with his hands)...Not the type that can clog the rush lane when asked to come up and support...Has very good timed speed, but must show a more explosive second gear to help him recover...Can be fooled by double moves...A former tailback but doesn't always use his vision to locate a clear path on interception returns...Good at making plays in front of him, but struggles to keep his head on a swivel, which causes him to lose sight of the ball trying to make the over-the-shoulder grab.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a lean frame with room to carry at least another 10 pounds of bulk without the added weight impacting his quickness...Intense competitor who might lose physical battles, but it is not because of a lack of effort...Won't impact a ballcarrier with his drag-down tackle style, but he does a good job of staying in front of the runner, grabbing and holding on until help arrives...Intelligent athlete with very good hand-eye coordination, vision and ability to recognize the patterns as they develop...Is very smooth in his backpedal, staying low in his pads with excellent transition quickness...Uses that speed to get a jump on the route to break up plays...Has the body control, balance and adjustment skills to get to off-target throws...Has a solid work ethic and while not vocal, he has been a good leader-by-example type...Needs to use his hands better in attempts to jam, but when he doesn't fight the ball, he can look it in for a clean interception...Has the quick feet to compensate for a marginal hand punch (in attempts to reroute), as he allows little cushion and has the recovery speed to get back into the play on the rare occasions he bites on pump fakes...Maintains good position on the receiver throughout the route, along with the hip flexibility and knowledge of taking good angles to close in a hurry...Has loose hips and is a smooth open-field runner, doing a nice job of flipping and accelerating without having to gather coming out of his breaks...Seldom separates for long when he is locked on his coverage assignment...Keeps the action in front of him playing in the zone and has a good feel for handling the switch-off...Makes plays in deep coverage and shows solid ball skills, which could be even better if he improves his timing competing for the jump ball...Has the hips and body control to get good depth in his pass drops and flashes tremendous acceleration running down the sideline (must learn not to bite on double moves)...Will come up and support vs. the run, but is not strong enough to take on the bigger offensive linemen...Has not done it often, but he has very good burst through the wedge on kickoff returns...Not the type that eyeballs the backfield too long (won't bite on play-action)...Shows good knee bend and lateral movement working his way down the line and has the loose hips to open up and generate a quick short-area burst to close.\r"

                "Overview": "Overshadowed by teammate Mike Jenkins, Trae Williams has quietly gone about his business, but if you ask opposing offensive coordinators, they will tell you that it was Williams who they worried about the most. Part of what many experts called the best cornerback tandem in college, Williams and Jenkins were largely responsible for USF's defensive success for the last three years.\r\nWith bookend cornerbacks, South Florida ranked 16th in the nation in pass efficiency defense in 2005 (109.38 rating), improving to 11th in the country in 2006 (104.26) and eighth in the NCAA ranks in 2007 (105.27). The two defensive backs would start a combined total of 85 games during their time with the Bulls. \r\nWilliams proved to be one of the premier coverage defenders in the history of the university and Big East Conference. He ranks second in South Florida annals with 16 interceptions and holds the school all-time record with 219 yards and four touchdowns returns. The school did not join the Big East until 2005, but in three seasons, his 15 interceptions (one in 2004 while USF was in Conference USA) rank third in league history.\r\nAt Durant High School, Williams earned Class 5A All-State second-team honors. He added first-team All-County accolades from the Tampa Tribune, also picking up first-team all-Suncoast and All-County recognition from the St. Petersburg Times.\r\nKnown more for his offensive skills, Williams scored a school-record 22 touchdowns in 2002, including six on punt returns. He rushed for 1,355 yards with 10-plus yards per carry. Against traditional Polk County and state power Lakeland High, he carried 12 times for 178 yards and all four of his team's touchdowns in a Durant win. As a junior, he rushed for 550 yards and six touchdowns and also recorded 55 tackles as a defensive back. He played in the Hillsborough County All-Star Game, earning Most Valuable Player honors.\r\nWilliams turned down scholarship offers from Central Florida and Iowa State to enroll at South Florida in 2003. He was the recipient of the Golden Bull Award, given to the Bulls' top Scout Team player on offense, performing as a halfback for that unit.\r\nShifting to defense for 2004, Williams took over for an injured Mike Jenkins at left cornerback, starting eight contests, including the final seven games. He totaled 22 tackles (14 solo) with five pass deflections and returned an interception 37 yards for a touchdown. He also averaged 21.9 yards on nine kickoff returns.\r\nThe coaching staff shifted Jenkins to right cornerback in order to put the two talented defensive backs on the field together in 2005. Williams started every game at left cornerback, except vs. West Virginia. He collected 39 tackles (23 solo) with three pass breakups and two interceptions. He also returned three kickoffs for 63 yards (21.0-yard average).\r\nWilliams was named the team's Defensive Player of the Year as a junior, adding All-Big East Conference first-team honors. He registered 49 tackles (32 solo) and tied the school season-record with seven interceptions, tying for fifth on the Big East Conference record chart. He also batted away nine passes, blocked a punt and averaged 13.3 yards on three kickoff returns.\r\nDespite having a better season in 2007, Williams was selected to the All-Big East second-team. He had a career-high 55 tackles (47 solo), his first career sack and two stops for losses. He broke up 11 passes and intercepted six others, setting a school record and tying the Big East season mark by returning three of those thefts for touchdowns.\r\nIn 49 games at south Florida, Williams started 45 contests. He recorded 165 tackles (116 solo) with a one-yard sack and 2.5 stops for losses of five yards. He gained 219 yards with four touchdowns on 16 interception returns, adding a 13-yard return of a blocked punt and 300 yards on 16 kickoff returns (18.8-yard average). He deflected 28 passes and his total of 44 defended passes rank second in school annals."

When the Chargers moved him to linebacker, they found a dominant force that could also attack the backfield and pressure the pocket. If some NFL team takes that lesson learned by the Chargers and shows patience letting Avril develop at strong-side linebacker, they could be rewarded with a Phillips clone. There is no question that he has the speed to cover receivers in the short-to-intermediate area and if he's not getting pounded by offensive linemen that outweigh him by 50-80 pounds on every play, his level of play could rival that of Phillips and another former Boilermaker, Dallas' Anthony Spencer.",
                    "Negatives": "Undersized defensive end who converted from outside linebacker early in his junior year and lacks the bulk to face up to the bigger offensive tackles...Can beat a slower offensive lineman off the snap with his hand on the ground, showing a sudden burst, but if the lineman gets his hands locked on, he struggles to shed...Lacks the anchor to maintain ground vs. double teams and can be pushed back when trying to work inside (does have a nifty spin move in-line to beat a lethargic blocker)...Much more effective playing in space and on the move, as he gets absorbed too much by double teams working on the line of scrimmage...Can get the ballcarrier down along the outside, but needs to wrap and get in front of the opponent better, as he tends to grab or take a side (stronger runners like Ohio State's Chris Wells and Wisconsin's P.J. Hill had good success breaking his arm tackles)...Has the speed to impact the pocket coming off the edge, but his pass-rush moves are still raw and he needs to add to those array of moves (has a great spin move, but must be more forceful with his hands on club moves and show better shoulder positioning on rip moves)...Telegraphs his moves coming off the snap and when his hands get outside his frame, blockers can easily neutralize his counter moves...Not strong enough to plug the inside rush lanes as a defensive lineman...Will need time to re-adjust to playing linebacker (must refine his pass drop depth and open his hips quicker to come out of his breaks.\r",

Gives total effort in his chase and plays with his head up, showing good instincts to find the ball, especially vs. naked bootlegs...Better performer on the move than working through trash and has the balance to quickly redirect and close...Will generate better production standing up, but even with his hand down, if he gets a dip inside, a slower blocker can't recover...Smart player who will have no problem digesting a playbook at multiple positions (down lineman/strong-side linebacker/rush end)...Plays with good aggression and determination, despite being outweighed vs. every opponent...Plays until the whistle and builds acceleration nicely when attacking downfield...Puts in extra hours studying tape of the upcoming opponent and, while a leader by example, he will not hesitate to get vocal in the huddle...His best asset is his initial step off the snap, as he is quick to elude, dip his pads and redirect to plays underneath...Has a good feel for reading blocking keys and is usually in proper position, rarely biting on play-action...Attacks the point with good intent, even when he knows he will be washed out by the bigger blockers...Has good balance, staying on his feet and bounces up quickly when cut...Is quick to react to the play when he locates the ball and has the short-area quickness to spill inside, getting his hands up to deflect passes at the line of scrimmage...Takes good angles coming off the edge and shows good vision to locate the quarterback and flush him out of the pocket...Needs to use his hands more to ward off blocks, but is a slippery type with good avoidance skills on the move...Will sometimes run around blocks, but can stay square in one-on-one encounters...Uses his hands well to keep separation when he keeps them inside his frame...Scrapes to the ball well and has good press ability when playing over the tight end...Prefers using his swim move at the \"five\" technique to combat turn out blocks, but just needs to do it with better consistency...Carries his pads well, evident in Senior Bowl practices when he constantly chased down ballcarriers on the outside or challenged the QBs on naked bootlegs...Capable of getting very good production making plays from the backside, as he seems to work his hands better there in attempts to shed blockers and fall underneath...Good go-with-the-flow outside run container who can run, slide and move in space to make plays...Will flow too fast and overrun a few plays, but is quick to redirect...Keeps his feet and will sell out to get wide on a play (runs long distances to deliver the hit)...Not a hammer-type of hitter, but can run the field, hit and sell out, showing the body control to break down and wrap up (gets lazy at times and tries to take a side, but showed improvement in rectifying this as a senior)...You won't see too many misses or leaks when tackling, if he keeps his hands inside and pad level true...Shows good anticipation coming off the snap and, when he finds a clean rush lane, he will sell out, go airborne and do whatever is needed to pressure the pocket...Has a natural chop-and-swipe technique off the line, but uses his hands better vs. the run than as a pass rusher...Knows how to change and vary his speed when he breaks free from blockers...Covers ground and closes well from the backside better than he does in-line...Has a decent feel for the blitz and with his speed, he can bring the heat, thanks to good change-of-direction skills that make it difficult for slower linemen to block him.\r"

                "Overview": "Purdue has become very proud to be known as the \"Den of Defensive Ends.\" \r\nIn recent years, the Boilermakers' program has produced future NFL pass-rushing specialists Akin Ayodele (Dallas) Rosevelt Colvin (New England), Ray Edwards (Minnesota), Rob Ninkovich (Miami), Chike Okeafor (Arizona), Shaun Phillips (San Diego) and Anthony Spencer (Dallas). Many scouts feel that Cliff Avril will soon take his place with those former Boilermakers in terrorizing NFL quarterbacks.\r\nSome teams have projected Avril as a rush end, but due to his lack of bulk and size, he could shift back to strong-side linebacker. Much like Shaun Phillips, Avril relies on his impressive foot speed and ability to shed blocks on the move to be a constant nuisance in the backfield. Since moving to defensive end two seasons ago, Avril registered 30 of his 35.5 tackles behind the line of scrimmage and 12.5 of his 13 sacks from the left end position.\r\nAt Clay High School, Avril earned second-team All-State honors as a defensive end during his senior year, yet, he was rated the 37-best outside linebacker prospect in the nation by Rivals.com. He was named to the Florida Times-Union Super 24 team and twice earned All-Conference accolades.\r\nAs a senior, Avril led the team to an 11-2 record. That year, he registered 80 tackles, nine sacks and eleven stops behind the line of scrimmage. He also deflected four passes. In addition to competing on the gridiron, he lettered in basketball, track and field and weight-lifting. \r\nAvril enrolled at Purdue in 2004 and saw considerable action as a true freshman. He appeared in 12 games, starting four contests at strong-side linebacker. He was in on 36 tackles (23 solo), as he assisted on a sack and made three stops for losses. He also caused a fumble and batted away one pass.\r\nAvril played in 10 games as a sophomore, as a midseason back injury that was later diagnosed as a fracture, hampered him the rest of the year and forced him to sit out the Wisconsin game, in addition to being limited in spring drills the following year. He made 33 tackles (21 solo) with 2.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage while starting four contests in 2005.\r\nAs a junior, Avril made several changes, switching from jersey No. 85 that he wore his first two seasons to No. 32. He started the first four games at strong-side linebacker, but then shifted to left defensive end for the final 10 games. He went on to rank ninth in the Big Ten Conference with 15 stops for losses. He registered 84 tackles (51 solo), third-best on the team and tied for second on the Boilermakers' defense with six sacks. He caused two fumbles, recovered another and picked off a pass. He also deflected six other tosses.\r\nIn 2007, Avril was named first-team All-Big Ten Conference by The NFL Draft Report and second-team by the league's media. He started all 13 games at left defensive end, where he led the team and tied for tenth in the conference with 6.5 sacks. He again paced the Boilermakers with 15 stops behind the line of scrimmage, the ninth-best total in the Big Ten. He caused four fumbles, recovered three others and broke up five passes. He also returned an interception for a touchdown.\r\nIn 49 games at Purdue, Avril started 35 contests, with 12 starts coming at strong-side linebacker and the other 23 at left defensive end. He ranks 12th in school history with 13 sacks for minus-79 yards and finished 11th in Purdue annals with 35.5 stops for losses of 137 yards. He caused seven fumbles and recovered four others while also deflecting 12 passes. He intercepted two passes, good for 48 yards in returns, including one touchdown.\r\nAvril is the next Purdue pass rusher capable of making an impact in the NFL. He has great burst off the snap and because of his strength, hustle and strong hand play, he can be an effective 4-3 defensive end. \r\nDespite his burst off the snap, however, Avril isn't a natural pass rusher. He lacks creative moves and only 6.5 of his team-leading 15 tackles for loss this past season were sacks. Avril is a good enough athlete, however, to play in space, and has developed into a cerebral defender potentially capable of making the switch back to outside linebacker -- a position he played his first two seasons for Purdue."

                "Overview": "Playing for the Aggies has become a family tradition, as Chris comes from a long line of Texas A&M football players. His uncle, Dave Elmendorf, was a three-way All-American at A&M, earning honors in football, baseball and academics, and went on to an all-pro career in the National Football League with the Los Angeles Rams. Dave presently serves as the color commentator for A&M football games.\r\nIn addition to his uncle Dave (Class of '71), Harrington's two other uncles, Harry (Class of '70) and Patrick (Class of '71) Elmendorf attended Texas A&M and the first Aggie from his family was Chris' grandfather, Ed Elmendorf (Class of '38), who was on the football roster in the late 30s.\r\nA model of consistency and production, Harrington also showed tremendous toughness during his junior year. That season, he played throughout with a painful right shoulder rotator cuff tear, but still started all 13 games. He would go on to start 36 of 49 games he played in for the university, recording 156 tackles with 15 sacks and 25 stops behind the line of scrimmage.\r\nHarrington was an All-District and Class 5A All-State selection at St. Pius X High School, leading the team to the district and regional championship as a senior. That year, he recorded 50 solo tackles and chalked up seven sacks. He was nominated for ESPN's Army All-American Game and was named the 2002 Private School Player of the Year by Dave Campbell's Texas Football Magazine.\r\nAs a junior, Harrington earned first-team All-District and All-State honors as well as being named to Prep Star's All-Region squad. He recorded 76 solo stops and recorded 13 sacks. He added All-District first-team and All-State honorable mention as a sophomore and was a part of the 1999 State Championship squad. He was named to the school's honor roll all four years and listed in the Who's Who Among American High School Students. He was also a member of the student council. \r\nHarrington red-shirted in 2003 at Texas A&M. In 2004, he was the team's first reserve off the bench at defensive end. He posted 14 tackles (8 solos) in 12 games, adding a pair of sacks and three stops for losses, missing the Cotton Bowl with a hip flexor strain. As a sophomore, Harrington started the first four games at left defensive end before moving to right end for the rest of the schedule. He delivered 25 tackles (15 solos) with seven stops behind the line of scrimmage, including four sacks.\r\nBattling shoulder problems all year did not stop Harrington from earning first-team All-Big 12 Conference honors in 2006. He manned the right defensive end position for all 13 games, as he totaled 59 tackles (30 solos), including seven sacks and 10 stops for losses. He also broke up three passes and caused two fumbles. After the season, he underwent left rotator cuff surgery.\r\nHarrington played in 13 games, starting the final 12 at left end in 2007. The All-Big 12 Conference second-team choice delivered 58 tackles (22 solos) with a pair of sacks and five stops for losses. He also caused and recovered two fumbles and blocked a kick while generating four pressures."

A three-year starter for the Badgers, he has that long arm reach and aggressive nature to consistently defeat blocks to make plays working down the line. But where he excels the most is as a bull rusher, where he has an array of power moves to dominate the offensive guards and centers.\r\nHayden was one of the more highly recruited prep prospects coming out of Arrowhead High School, where he was named the state's Defensive Lineman of the Year by the Wisconsin Football Coaches Association and earned first-team All-State honors for second straight year as a senior. \r\nThat year, he registered 89 tackles, including 18 stops for losses and 11 sacks, as he also caused five fumbles and blocked two kicks.

He managed just one assisted tackle, but gained valuable experience, taking over for a graduated Jason Jefferson at right defensive tackle in 2005. He earned All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention, as he posted a career-high 56 tackles (29 solos) with 5.5 sacks, nine stops for losses and four pass deflections. He also recovered three fumbles and caused another.\r\nHayden started all 13 games in 2006, but had a subpar campaign. He managed just 27 tackles (16 solos) with four stops for losses. He bounced back as a senior, picking up All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention. He totaled 48 tackles (25 solos) with 4.5 sacks, two pressures and 8.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He also recovered three fumbles and deflected two passes."

He also sat out the 2006 season opener while trying to get academic clearance.\r\nWhen healthy and motivated, Iwebema has proven to be a capable defensive end. He is more effective containing the run than rushing the passer, but has been known to deliver bone-jarring hits on ballcarriers. He also uses his arm length, reach and leaping ability to excel on special teams, having blocked four kicks during his career.\r\nIwebema was rated the 35th-best defensive end in the country by Rivals.com as a senior at James Bowie High School. He was a first-team All-Conference and honorable mention All-State and a second team All-Conference pick as a junior. The team captain made 89 tackles and 15 sacks during his career. He posted 48 tackles, 10 sacks and 18 stops for loss as a senior, adding 30 tackles and four sacks as a junior. A three-year letter winner in football, he also lettered twice in track, performing in the discus. \r\nIwebema spent the 2003 season on Iowa's scout team. He backed up Derreck Robinson at right defensive end in 2004, appearing in 12 games. He finished his rookie campaign with just three tackles. With Robinson graduated, the sophomore took over right end duties in 2005. He produced 48 tackles (32 solo) with seven sacks and 10 stops for losses. He also caused two fumbles and blocked a pair of kicks, receiving first-team All-Big Ten Conference honors from the media.\r\nIn 2006, Iwebema was a preseason All-American pick, but managed to appear in only eight games, starting seven. He sat out the season opener vs. Montana due to an academic suspension and was forced to miss four late-season contests with a broken right collarbone. He managed to make 27 tackles (17 solo) with three sacks and three pressures, as he also caused one fumble and deflected a pair of passes.\r\nIwebema missed most of the Illinois game with a shoulder injury and sat out the Ball State clash with his second concussion. In 11 starts at right end, he posted 28 tackles (11 solo), 3.5 sacks, five stops behind the line of scrimmage and three pressures.

He lacks pass rush moves, relying more on a clean release from the outside or squeezing through the gaps to impact the pocket. Still, he has been productive vs. the ground game, and later in the draft he is worth a pick to see if he can develop into a starter at end or tackle. At worst, he will provide decent back-up depth.",

Will uncoil and wrap the ballcarriers in short-area pursuit...Has a nasty streak which is evident as he moves through trash ...More comfortable in a blue collar role, as he prefers to combat combo blocks rather than work the edge...Needs to develop better pass rush moves, but with his reach he can get a blocker off balance with an efficient rip move... When he does not get too tall in his stance, he is better scraping down the line to give chase vs. the ballcarriers...Has a good concept for taking angles that shorten his path to the quarterback...Needs to work on his timing, but his long arms could be an asset for special teams as a kick blocker.\r"

                "Overview": "After beginning his collegiate career as a tight end for the Eagles, Jones shifted to strong-side defensive tackle as a sophomore. He developed into one of the nation's top run stuffers, ranking fifth in the NCAA in tackles for losses as a junior. He continued to excel in the trenches as a senior while playing tackle and defensive end, finishing tied for seventh in the country with 19.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage.\r\nFor his career, Jones registered 50 stops for losses, ranking 16th all-time in Mid-American Conference history. Only Kenny Philpot (74, 1998-2001) registered more stops behind the line of scrimmage than Jones in Eastern Michigan annals.\r\nAt Lathrup High School, Jones enjoyed an outstanding prep career as a football and basketball player. He was named first-team All-Oakland Athletic Association as a senior, recording 27 tackles, six sacks, four forced fumbles and seven interceptions, three of which were returned for touchdowns. He also caught 25 passes for 395 yards and eight touchdowns as a receiver. The Detroit News named him the 44th-best player on the Blue Chip list in the state of Michigan, as he also added All-Metro North honors.\r\nJones started as a junior and senior on the school's basketball team. He led the hoops squad to the Class A regionals in 2003-04 after averaging 24 points, 14 rebounds, five assists and two blocks. He was chosen Most Valuable Player in the Motor City Roundball Classic, as he also garnered third-team Class A All-State pick as well as a first-team All-Metro North recognition. \r\nAs a junior, Jones was selected by the Detroit Free Press as a third-team Class A All-State, first-team All-Metro North and second-team All-Metro pick in basketball. The Southfield Observer & Eccentric named him to their All-Area hoops team and he was also named his squad's Most Valuable Player.\r\nAs a true freshman, Jones started three of 11 games he played in as a tight end for Eastern Michigan. He also saw action on the defensive line midway through the season, making one solo tackle while grabbing four passes for 12 yards.\r\nJones took over strong-side defensive duties the following season, earning Player of the Week honors twice. He made 47 tackles (28 solos) while ranking second on the squad with 6.5 sacks and 12 stops for losses. He also registered six pressures and a safety.\r\nThe coaching staff unleashed Jones on opposing ballcarriers in 2006, as he led the Mid American Conference and ranked fifth in the nation with 18.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage. The second-team All-MAC pick added four sacks and two pressures while finishing sixth on the squad with 57 tackles (29 solos). He also caused two fumbles.\r\nJones received All-American third-team and All-MAC first-team honors in 2007. He tied for seventh in the NCAA with a career-high 19.5 stops for losses, as he posted 70 tackles (43 solos), the third-best total on the team. He added 10 pressures as he recovered and caused a fumble while breaking up three passes and blocking a kick.\r\nIn 45 games at Eastern Michigan, Jones started 33 times on defense and three times on offense. He collected 175 tackles (101 solos) with 14 sacks for minus-101 yards and ranks second in school history with 50 stops for losses of 194 yards. He generated 18 quarterback pressures, recovered one fumble and caused three others. He deflected three passes, blocked a kick and registered a safety. He also caught four passes for 12 yards."

                    "Compares To": "PAT WILLIAMS-Minnesota...Anyone that remembers when Williams entered the league knows he was as raw as sushi. He developed into a Pro Bowl talent.  Rubin might not have the same success, but he is a physical, stay-at-home battler who is best when occupying multiple blockers. Because of his anchor and long arms, he is also rated as an offensive guard, as some team might feel they could see him develop into a pro player at that position.",
                    "Negatives": "Negatives...Needs to stay lower in his pads, as he can dominate and split double teams when he sinks his weight and fires low off the snap, but when he gets too tall and erect, he loses anchor and can be washed out of the play...Strictly a bull rusher, as he lacks suddenness or timed speed to generate long pursuit to haul down the quarterback...Does not demonstrate an array of pass-rush moves (will generally club or rip, but lacks spin and swim moves)...Best when parking at the line of scrimmage and waiting for the action to come to him, as he lacks the loose hips to get back into the action when he gets too aggressive and outruns the play...Has excellent power, but he needs to develop a better nutritional program and improve his stamina, as he will run out of gas and disappear late in games....Not the type that will chase down ballcarriers on the outside (does not have the speed), where he is slower reacting to the ball (does not seem to see outside runs as well as he does when working in-line)....Must be more consistent bending his knees and using his hands to get leverage.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a squat, but thick and wide frame with good chest and shoulder development, muscular arms, big thighs and thick calves with excellent arm length and large, powerful hands...Active and aggressive anchoring in the middle of the field, showing good efficiency in one-gap alignments, as he is a hard charger who might lack quickness, but will battle until the whistle...Has the strength and hand punch to defeat double-team activity...Not sudden off the ball, but consistently gets a jump on the offensive lineman with his short-area burst...Needs to do it more regularly, but when he plays at a low pad level, he is rarely knocked off balance...Fights and wins vs. combo blocks when he keeps his hands active...Will lose sight of the ball at times when engaged, but shows good urgency getting to it when he sees the play develop (struggles to locate outside running plays, but is much more effective working in-line)...Knows how to use his strength to control his gap and, when he generates quickness with his hands, he can shed and make the play...Very strong when he sinks his weight and anchors, as he easily combats multiple blockers...Showed improved arm and hand technique to shed blocks during his senior year...Delivers good force behind his hits, but needs to show better knee bend to get leverage...More comfortable as a bull rusher, as he has the functional short-area burst to penetrate (but lacks feet to seal the deal)...As a senior, he had much better technique when it came to replacing his hands and fighting to keep offensive linemen off his body (will get his legs taken out from under him when he does not keep his hands active)...Has adequate explosion, but works hard through trash to make tackles vs. the running play behind the line of scrimmage.\r"

                "Overview": "One of the few bright spots for the Cyclones in 2007, Rubin has been a dominant force in the middle of the field since taking over nose guard duties as a junior. He was regarded as one of the premier junior college players in the nation at Trinity Valley Community College before enrolling at Iowa State in 2006.\r\nRubin is still developing, but offers NFL teams the opportunity to mold this fireplug in the middle of their front wall. Some teams are eyeing him for a potential move to the offensive line, where he starred as a guard for Trinity College as a sophomore.\r\nRubin was a defensive lineman at Escambia High School, earning All-Conference and All-Area honors. He registered 8.5 sacks during his senior year, along with 54 tackles. He spent the 2004 season playing on the defensive line at Trinity College, moving to offensive guard in 2005. \r\nRubin was an All-Southwest Junior College Football Conference first-team pick and rated as the 73rd-best overall player in the junior college ranks by Rivals.com. He added All-American honorable mention, as he collected 90 knockdowns and eight touchdown-resulting blocks for an offense that generated 388.27 yards per game. The team boasted a 9-3 record and ranked seventh in the nation. They captured the Pilgrim Bowl, with a victory over Northeast Mississippi College.\r\nRubin was a late addition at Iowa State in 2006, joining the team just before the season opener. He saw limited action in the first three games before moving into the lineup at nose guard. In 12 games, he registered 34 tackles (18 solo) with a sack and four stops behind the line of scrimmage.\r\nAs a senior, Rubin was named to The NFL Draft Report's Super Sleeper Team. He added All-Big Twelve Conference honorable mention, starting all 12 games at nose guard. He delivered 42 tackles (24 solo) with 1.5 sacks and four stops for losses. He recovered and caused a fumble while also deflecting one pass."

                "Overview": "Thomas DeCoud, an athletic pass defender with the quickness to play cornerback, is known for his skills on special teams. \r\nWith excellent leaping ability and long arms, he blocked six kicks during his first two seasons with the Bears. Despite his lean frame, he has also proven to be a solid tackler in the box, relishing his role of taking on ballcarriers on outside running plays.\r\nHis versatility was invaluable at Cal, where he played every position in the secondary. With his ball anticipation skills and acceleration to close on plays in front of him, DeCoud might have found a home at free safety, earning a full-time job for the first time in his collegiate career at that position as a senior. He is known around the Pac-10 Conference for his athleticism and intensity. \"I've been hit by everybody on the team,\" Cal tailback Justin Forsett told the San Francisco Chronicle. \"When Thomas hits you, it's not something you want to remember.\"  \r\nDeCoud was a standout football and basketball player at Pinole Valley High School. He earned first team All-Alameda Contra Costa Athletic League accolades during a brilliant senior season in which he recorded 80 tackles and two interceptions at cornerback, and caught 23 passes for 600 yards at wide receiver. As a junior, he was awarded All-ACCAL honors in both football and basketball.\r\nThe 175-pound freshman spent his first season at California playing cornerback on the scout team in 2003. He spent most of the 2004 campaign on the special-team coverage units, appearing in 10 games as a reserve cornerback, finishing with nine tackles (six solos) and a fumble recovery. He also led the Pac-10 Conference with three blocked kicks, despite playing early in the year with a right ankle sprain suffered in fall camp.\r\nDeCoud shifted to free safety as a sophomore, playing in 11 games behind Harrison Smith. He continued to excel on special teams, again blocking three kicks. He also came up with 28 tackles (18 solos) with a stop for a loss, but was bothered early in the year by a hyper-extended right knee and a left thumb sprain that would require surgery during the 2005 season.\r\nDeCoud took over free safety duties, starting the team's first four games of the 2006 season before missing the Oregon State and Oregon contests due to a right knee sprain in the Arizona State game. He returned to action as a reserve behind Bernard Hicks, making 45 tackles (20 solos) with a stop behind the line of scrimmage and three pass breakups, earning Cal's Most Improved Player honors.\r\nAs a senior, DeCoud was named the defensive captain, picking up Cal MVP and All-Pac 10 Conference honorable mention. He started the first 12 games, registering a career-high 116 tackles (71 solo) to lead the Bears' defense. He added a sack with three stops for losses, as he recovered a fumble and caused two others. He also had an interception and four pass deflections."

Some teams are looking to possibly move him to safety, but I doubt if his pass coverage skills or lack of awareness playing deep in the zone is going to benefit him with that move. To play inside at the NFL level, he will need to bulk up, but his frame is very close to maximum growth potential. His marginal strength is another problem for playing middle linebacker. He is best served outside on the weak side. For all of his physical limitations, 463 tackles indicate he knows how to get to the ball.",
                    "Negatives": "Lacks ideal bulk and has marginal muscle tone, both in his upper and lower body regions...Needs to add more weight, but his frame is at maximum growth potential and will affect his speed, which is just adequate...Has good recovery ability, but will get quite reckless on the field and jump the snap at times, resulting in an offside penalty or a missed read...His marginal strength makes him a liability working at the line of scrimmage, as he is instantly engulfed by the larger blockers...Has some hip stiffness that forces him to throttle down when redirecting...Best when slipping under blocks to make the play, as he will often lose the battle if he tries to out-muscle the blocker...Still a work in progress with his instincts and ball anticipation skills, despite 463 tackles to his credit...Slow to adjust on the move...Lacks the sheer power needed to stack or control the offensive linemen...Has a low center of gravity and will tackle low, but when he does so, a strong ballcarrier or lead blocker can knock him back...Gets turned and driven back when trying to shoot the inside gaps...Needs to develop better hand usage taking on the blocker, as he short arms too much, especially when he should extend them to shed... Also needs to use his hands with more authority while trying to reroute the receiver...More of a reach and grab tackler and despite his lofty totals, he has a penchant for ducking his head before making the hit (sometimes loses sight of the ball carrier that way)...Lacks the fluid hip turn to get good depth in his pass drops and struggles to man up with the receiver, making this an area of concern for a possible move to safety at the next level... Must show better body control in his backpedal...Late to react to the thrown ball, but shows urgency to close once he locates it...Lacks route awareness and can be taken out of his cleats by the receiver's double moves...Best when he has a clear lane to the quarterback, as he struggles to adjust and flatten when closing on the pocket.\r",

Including bowl games, he registered 463 tackles during his career, the eighth-best total in NCAA major college history and the second-best among active players behind Central Michigan's Red Keith (465). No player in college had more total tackles (173) or averaged more tackles per game (13.31) in 2007 than the Buffaloes' weak-side inside linebacker.\r\nColorado, which recognizes only regular-season statistics, placed Dizon fourth on its all-time record chart. Only Barry Remington (493, 1982-86), Matt Russell (446, 1993-96) and Greg Biekert (441, 1989-92) produced more stops during their CU careers.\r\nIn 2007, Dizon became the first Buff defensive player to win Big 12 Conference Player of the Year honors and the first to garner league player of the year honors among Colorado defenders since cornerback Deon Figures earned the nod in 1992, the same year he won the Jim Thorpe Award as the nation's top defensive back. \r\n\"He is very deserving,\" head coach Dan Hawkins said. \"Good things happen to good people and he is one of those guys. He has had a tremendous season; he's played very well and been very productive. He has been very consistent and very solid, all the things I've said before. He shows up every day, he's a very humble guy, he plays hurt, great leader -- just very solid all the way around. He should be the Butkus (Award) guy as well.\" \r\n\"He's everything you want in a young man, everything you want in a football player. I just hope everybody votes right, because I know every scout who comes in here, bar none, says he's the best linebacker in the country,\" Hawkins stated.\r\nPhysically, the squat and powerful Hawaiian more resembles Mike Singletary, Tom Jackson and Sam Mills, among the many cerebral, fiery and undersized linebackers who had long NFL careers than he does Brian Urlacher, who fits the ideal prototype. \"Me being little, me being tiny, I've got the feet to make up for it,\" Dizon said. \"I've got the will, I've got the heart and everything you ask for in a small player to do a big man's job.\" \r\nAt Waimea High School, Dizon earned Prep Football Report and Prep Star All-West honors, earning second-team All-State and Kauai Interscholastic Federation (KIF) All-Star accolades. PFR ranked him as the 65th-best player in the region and the third-ranked running back, calling him \"potentially the top fullback on the west coast,\" and Rivals.com ranked him as the eighth-best running back prospect nationally. \r\nDizon was injured most of the regular season his senior year, rushing once for a 12-yard touchdown run but catching nine passes for 250 yards and three scores in just over two games. As a junior, he rushed 150 times for 1,157 yards and 13 touchdowns, and caught 15 passes for 175 yards. He started at linebacker on defense and was in on 75 tackles. He also handled some of the punting chores.\r\nDizon also lettered four times in basketball (forward), where he was a three-time Player of the Year/Island (KIF), as well as a three-time honorable mention All-State performer.  He also lettered three times in track (sprints, the 100-meter KIF champion as a junior), and once in soccer.\r\nPerhaps due to his senior high school injury, Dizon was only recruited by Colorado. The linebacker's school, Waimea High, is on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, the westernmost high school in the United States. There were only 20 players on Dizon's high school team, almost all of whom played offense and defense. CU linebackers coach Brian Cabral, who has been at Colorado the last 18 years, is a native of Kailua, Hawaii, and got a tip from a high school coach about Dizon. Without seeing Dizon in person, Cabral sent him some information about Colorado's summer football camp. \r\nEvery summer the Dizons would travel from Kauai to New York (Jordon's mother's hometown), usually laying over in Denver. So the summer after Jordon's junior year in high school, the family decided to spend a few extra days in Denver and have Jordon attend Colorado's camp. Colorado offered him a scholarship shortly thereafter. \"No one knew who I was,\" said Dizon. \"Colorado was the only school to recruit me. I was at a small school on an island in the middle of the ocean. It was luck of the draw. I went to the camp and met the right people. I didn't even play football my senior year because I got hurt. But Colorado stood by the scholarship offer.\"  \r\nIn 2004, Dizon enjoyed one of the finest seasons by a true freshman in school history, as he was CU's first true frosh to be recognized as the Big 12 Conference's Defensive Newcomer of the Year (Associated Press) and the Defensive Freshman of the Year (league coaches) awards. The Sporting News and Rivals.com selected him as a second-team Freshman All-American, he earned honorable mention All-Big 12 honors and led all freshmen in the conference in tackles with 82 (51 solo). That also established a CU true freshman record as he bettered the old total by some 15 stops (it was the second-most tackles posted by a frosh, redshirt or true, missing a new mark by just four).\r\nDizon lined up at weak-side inside linebacker as a sophomore, moving from the outside linebacker spot. He registered 61 tackles (42 solos) with three sacks, seven stops for losses and four pressures. He also broke up a pass and added three special team tackles to garner All-Big 12 Conference honorable mention.\r\nAs a junior, Dizon started 11 games at inside linebacker, coming off the bench after the first series vs. Nebraska. He ranked tied with Mississippi's Patrick Willis for sixth in the nation with an average of 11.42 tackles per game. He led the Buffs with 137 tackles (80 solos), adding four sacks, two pressures and 11 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He recovered two fumbles, caused another and delivered 17 third-down stops.\r\nIn 2007, Dizon became the first Colorado defender since Matt Russell in 1996 to earn consensus All-American first-team honors. He was a unanimous All-Big 12 first-team pick and league Defensive Player of the Year. During the regular season, he posted 160 tackles (120 solos). Including the Independence Bowl, he registered 173 hits, leading the nation with an average of 13.31 tackles per game. He had 19 third-down tackles, along with four sacks, 11 stops for losses and eight pressures. He also had the first two pass thefts for his career, returning one for a touchdown.\r\nIn 48 games, Dizon started 46 times, averaging 9.17 tackles per game, as he collected 440 hits (293 solos) with 12 sacks for minus-97 yards, 35 stops for losses of 137 yards and 15 quarterback pressures. He caused three fumbles, recovered two others and deflected nine passes while participating in 2,547 regular-season snaps. He gained 79 yards with a score on two interceptions and posted 48 third-down stops, the second-most in school history."

He has the speed to give good chase along the perimeter, but does have some hip stiffness in transition that prevents him from staying on the hip of a receiver on deeper routes. He lacks toughness off the field, as he lets minor injuries affect his play and will not play hurt. His marginal production in the opposition's backfield is a concern. He certainly looks the part with his chiseled body. Like Beck, his ability to play all three linebacker positions will provide a team with depth, but before he's regarded as a potential starter, Gooden will have to show more fortitude challenging blockers and attacking the backfield.",

                "Overview": "Considered the most dominating defensive player in the state of Florida during his days at St. Thomas Aquinas High School, Tavares Gooden had a respectable, yet unspectacular career at Miami until he shifted to middle linebacker as a senior. Hampered by an assortment of injuries during his first three seasons with the Hurricanes, he bounced from weak-side to strong-side linebacker until he found a home in the middle.\r\nGooden is cut from the same cloth as past Miami linebackers -- a cat-quick defender who is very physical with his hands, using them well to maintain separation from blockers. Few defenders display the lateral pursuit skills that Gooden has. He is also an explosive tackler who consistently drags ballcarriers to the ground.\r\nRegarded as one of the state's top players as a junior and senior at St. Thomas Aquinas High School, Gooden was a two-time Class 4A All-State selection, adding first-team All-Broward honors at defensive end in 2002. Considered the most dominating defender in Florida, he was rated the nation's sixth-best linebacker by Allen Wallace's Super Prep and was named a Super Prep All-American.\r\nGooden was rated the sixth-best outside linebacker in the nation by Tom Lemming's Prep Football Report and was a member of the Rivals100 National Top 100 squad, in addition to receiving Super Southern 100 honors from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The Orlando Sentinel Florida Top 100 pick was also a second-team selection on the Fox Sports Net All-South Team.\r\nAs a senior, Gooden registered 87 tackles, 12.5 sacks and three forced fumbles. He added 26 tackles with four sacks and eight stops for losses as a linebacker and also saw action as a fullback during his junior campaign. He also excelled in track. He was the 2002 state champion in the discus at 181'0\" (had a personal best of 197 feet) and added personal-bests of 20'1\" in the long jump and 6\"8\" in the high jump.\r\nGooden enrolled at Miami in 2003, choosing the Hurricanes over scholarship offers from Ohio State, Oklahoma, LSU and Tennessee. He played in 13 games behind D.J. Williams at weak-side linebacker, coming up with 10 tackles (six solo).\r\nGooden took over weak-side linebacker chores for the first nine games of the 2004 season, but saw limited action in the final three games due to a left shoulder injury. He would still finish third on the team with 68 tackles (28 solo), a sack, 5.5 stops for losses and five pressures. He also deflected three passes.\r\nIn 2005, Gooden shifted to strong-side linebacker, making a pair of tackles in the season opener vs. Florida State. He dislocated his left shoulder in that contest and was granted a medical redshirt. He returned to start four of eleven games at strong-side linebacker in 2006, missing the Maryland and Virginia contests due to a concussion. He would produce 36 tackles (23 solo) with 2.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage, three pressures and a trio of pass breakups.\r\nGooden made his third move within the linebacker unit in 2007, taking over in the middle. He led the team with a career-high 100 tackles (60 solo), including three stops for losses, an interception and three pass deflections."

                "Overview": "Regarded as the best receiving fullback in college football, Jacob Hester did a stellar job playing halfback during the Tigers' national championship march in 2007. \r\nHester was capable of filling almost role coaches asked. As a freshman and sophomore, he was mostly a blocker on offense, but he also made a name for himself as a fierce tackler on kick-coverage units. \r\nAt Evangel Christian High School, Hester was regarded as the state's top fullback, earning Louisiana Class 5A Offensive MVP honors in 2002. A member of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Super Southern 100 team, he led his team to a pair of state titles. He rushed for 868 yards on 182 carries and 22 touchdowns en route to the Class 5A state champion-ship game in 2003, as he also made 47 catches for 523 yards and four scores.\r\nAs a junior, Hester rushed for 1,593 yards on 222 attempts with 24 touchdowns to spearhead the Eagles to the state title in 2002. He also caught 24 passes for 311 yards and two touchdowns.\r\nAs a true freshman at Louisiana State, Hester started vs. Georgia while appearing in 11 games for the offense in 2004. He managed just 123 yards on 20 carries (6.2-yard average) and 21 yards on two catches (10.5 avg). Where he made a name for himself was on special teams, delivering nine tackles (five solo).\r\nHe continued to excel on the coverage units in 2005, twice being named the Tigers' Special Teams Player of the Week. He started vs. Arkansas and appeared in 13 games on offense, totaling 114 yards with two touchdowns on 25 attempts (4.6-yard average). He snared 11 passes for 63 yards, returned a short kick five yards and fielded one punt for an 11-yard return. He picked off a pass for a 22-yard return vs. North Texas, blocked one kick and registered 11 tackles (five solo).\r\nWhether lining up at halfback or fullback, Hester went on to start all 13 games in 2006. He led the team with a paltry 440 yards on 94 carries (4.7-yard average), running for six touchdowns. He finished fourth on the squad with 35 receptions for 269 yards (7.7-yard average) and three scores, adding seven special teams tackles (six solo). Just minutes after LSU beat Arkansas on Nov. 24, Hester proposed to his girlfriend outside War Memorial Stadium. They married in the summer prior to his senior year.\r\nHester garnered All-Southeastern Conference second-team honors in 2007. He took over halfback duties full-time, rushing for a career-high 1,103 yards and 12 touchdowns on 225 attempts (4.9-yard average). He caught 14 passes for 106 yards (7.6 avg) and a score, as he also posted eight tackles (4 solos), causing a fumble that he recovered on special teams.\r\nIn 51 games at Louisiana State, Hester started 29 contests. He carried 364 times for 1,780 yards (4.9-yard average) and 20 touchdowns, fumbling just once during his career. He gained 459 yards with four scores on 62 receptions (7.4 avg), five yards on a kickoff return, 11 yards on a punt return and 22 yards on an interception return. He registered 35 tackles (20 solo) with a fumble recovery, a forced fumble and one blocked kick.\r\nHester made a big impression on scouts during practices at the Senior Bowl. San Francisco 49ers coach Mike Nolan said he would highly recommend Hester to anyone -- and maybe himself. \r\n\"He's an interesting guy,\" Nolan, the coach of the South team for the Senior Bowl game, said at a press conference following the last full practices for both teams. \"Those kinds of guys typically play. They play for a good while, and they help teams win a lot of games.\" \r\nHester's versatility and \"it\" factor made him a cult figure in Baton Rouge. \r\n\"Sometimes you're hoping a guy is that kind of guy when you really don't know,\" Nolan said. \"But what I've seen in college of him, a couple of things tell me that he will be that guy. Number one, I believe he was a key player on the national championship team. I would be shocked if he's not a damn good NFL player for that reason alone. I don't care what they say, I'll be shocked if he's not a damn good NFL player.\""

Brandon was a defensive back on the 1997 roster and older brother, Ed, was a defensive end at BYU from 1993-98 in between serving on a church mission. But scouts feel that their youngest, Brian, will be the son to take his game to the next level as an NFL Draft pick.\r\nBrian is a natural playmaker who showed marked improvement during his senior year. An intense offseason workout program saw him shed more than 15 pounds of bulk, helping increase his stamina and quickness on the field. With his instincts and athleticism, scouts feel he could be a nice fit as a weak-side linebacker. With his field vision and quick reactionary skills, some teams are also looking at beefing him back up for a possible move to middle linebacker.\r\n\"Kehl is just a flat-out player. He is one of those guys who is always around the football and is a ball hog and makes a lot of plays,\" BYU coach Bronco Mendenhall said. \"I have talked to some people out there and they tell me one thing about this guy, he is not only an athlete but he has got a mind that is absolutely unreal and football is important to him.\"\r\nKehl earned Salt Lake Tribune first-team All-State honors as a senior at Brighton High School. He added academic recognition with a 4.0 grade-point average that gained him a spot on the Academic All-State team.\r\nThe three-year letter-winner led his team to an 11-1 record and a Region II championship as a senior, garnering team MVP accolades. He also earned second-team All-Region and Region II MVP honors and as a junior.\r\nRecruited by Utah, Oregon, Utah State, Harvard, Yale, Penn and Idaho State, Kehl enrolled at Brigham Young in 2002. He posted 14 tackles (6 solos) in 11 games as a reserve right outside linebacker before embarking on a two-year church mission to Toronto.\r\nWhen he returned to the gridiron in 2005, he competed in 11 games as the key backup to Justin Lvettgrodt at right outside linebacker. He collected 30 tackles (15 solos) with a stop for a loss, as he also recovered and caused a fumble. He also blocked a punt that he recovered for an 11-yard advancement.\r\nKehl earned All-Mountain West Conference honorable mention and Academic All-MWC honors as a junior. He took over weak-side outside linebacker duties, ranking third on the squad with 70 tackles (35 solos). He added three sacks with eight stops for losses and recovered a fumble. He also broke up six passes.\r\nA trimmer Kehl garnered All-Mountain West Conference first-team accolades as a senior. The team captain finished second on the squad with a career-high 91 tackles (52 solos), adding four sacks and 11.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage, in addition to causing and recovering a fumble. He deflected four passes and had an interception in three consecutive games, returning one for a touchdown.\r\n\"Last year (2006) I didn't watch as much film as I could have, and I would have had a better year of more success had I done that,\" Kehl said. \"One of the things I did to add to my game this year is a higher study of film -- of myself, of my own mistakes and my own successes, and also of my opponents so I can attack their weaknesses.\""

He also holds the Badgers' all-time record by making 145-of-148 extra point attempts.\r\nThe 2007 Lou Groza Award semifinalist, given to the nation's premier place-kicker, Mehlhaff also garnered All-American first-team honors as a senior. A three-year starter who handled all field goals and extra-point attempts, Mehlhaff was a major reason the opposition consistently had poor field position. In handling kickoff chores, 123 of his attempts were touchbacks and 160 of those kicks were returned for a 19.75-yard average, none for touchdowns.\r\nMehlhaff was a decorated kicker during his time at Aberdeen Central High School. He was rated the premier place-kicker in the prep ranks by Rivals.com, earning All-American first-team honors from Ridell and second-team accolades from USA Today.

His body is well-built, but there is still room for additional growth without having the added weight impact his overall quickness.

                    "Positives": "Well-built athlete with very good muscle definition, long arms, good bubble and thick thighs and calves...Has a tight abdomen, broad shoulders and good chest thickness...Makes plays all over the field due to his above-average speed, ball-reaction skills and size to come up and generate good pop on contact when playing in the box...Plays special teams and gives total effort until the whistle...Reacts quickly in run support and has a punishing hand punch, using his arms properly to keep blockers off his feet...Decisive to diagnose, accelerates quickly to run alleys and is very instinctive closing on the ball, displaying loose hips in his plant-and-drive motion...Skilled deep coverage defender who has very quick feet and when he stays low in his backpedal, he shows fluid motions turning and running in transition...Has outstanding agility and balance closing on plays along the perimeter...Might get a bit wild and reckless attacking the ball, but he never slows down trying to close on the ballcarrier and is very effective at impeding the runner's forward progress by attacking the outside leg with consistency...Good team player who sets the tempo for the defense with his aggressive style of play...Has very nice short-area quickness to mirror the moves of receivers and refuses to allow any underneath cushion...Anticipates the action, showing proper timing and leaping ability tracking the ball in flight...Self-starter type that pushes others in the training room...Will compete throughout the play and has good strength to make the tackle in the box, using his arms well to get off blocks quickly to squeeze the rush lanes...Decisive ball skills and though he eyeballs the backfield at times, he is not the type that will get suckered out of position easily...Makes quick decisions, showing very good route recognition and feel staying with the receiver on long routes...Flexible athlete with the feet and explosion to stay stride-for-stride in man coverage, but is best when making plays in the open field...Can sink his hips and bend his knees to turn easily on the ball and often keeps a hand on his man through route progression...Settles in nicely dropping off in the zone, handling the switch-off with ease...Very decisive covering underneath and when he gets a good read on the quarterback, he can jump the play...Can cover a lot of ground chasing the ball in flight and has the second gear to recover when he falls behind...Will springs into his tackles and is very active staying in the receiver's face...Solid wrap-up tackler who shows good adjustment agility to break down and fit in the open...Has the hip snap to explode behind his tackles ...Extremely active in run support, especially when he uses his hands to play off blocks, as he is developing into an exceptional force-and-strike type...Quick to react and come downhill, as he has the size to take on and play off blocks (has improved his angles when making plays in traffic)...Even when he runs around blocks, he has the burst to close...Goes low in his stance and extends his arms to secure and wrap the ball carrier...Very comfortable working in the short area, doing a nice job of preventing the hooks and crossing patterns from developing...Turns his hips easily and gets his head around quickly on deep routes...Disruptive blitzer who gets aggressive when flushing the quarterback out of the pocket and shows consistency when closing.\r"

                "Overview": "By becoming the ninth safety to earn All-American honors, Kenny Phillips carries on the school's tradition of producing elite defensive backs. \r\nBurgess Owens was the first Miami safety to garner All-American recognition (1972) and it was nine years before the next one was selected in Fred Marion (1981). Bennie Blades was the school's first-time All-American safety (1986-87) and Ed Reed matched that total in 2000-01. Sean Taylor (2003) and Brandon Meriweather (2005) soon followed with their postseason honors. \r\nThe coaching staff called Phillips a player with the build of Sean Taylor and the knowledge and quickness of Ed Reed. With that combination, along with physical play that could rival that of any Hurricane linebacker, NFL scouts took notice.\r\nBeing regarded as the best safety in the game is nothing new with Phillips. While attending Carol High School he was rated the best safety in the prep ranks, earning USA Today Defensive Player of the Year honors as a senior free safety. The Parade All-American and Prep Star Top 100 Dream Team selection was also a member of the USA Today All-USA High School Football team and rated the nation's best safety prospect and 12th-best player regardless of position by Rivals.com.\r\nPhillips was ranked as the best safety and the 10th-best overall prospect by Scout.com and the top prospect in Dade County by the Miami Herald. He ranked as the best prospect in the state by the Orlando Sentinel, the second-best overall prospect in the country by the Tampa Tribune, and the 10th-best overall player by Tom Lemming. He was also a member of the Florida Times-Union Super 75 squad and played in the prestigious Army All-American Bowl.\r\nHe intercepted 16 passes during his career and, as a senior, he finished with 84 tackles, six interceptions, three fumble recoveries, four defensive touchdowns and three punt returns for touchdowns. As a junior, he delivered 54 tackles and seven interceptions, returning two of them for touchdowns, including a 100-yarder. As a sophomore, he made three interceptions and also competed in basketball and track.\r\nIn 2005, Phillips enrolled at Miami, choosing the university over scholarship offers from Tennessee, Florida State and North Carolina State. He earned Freshman All-American and All-Atlantic Coast Conference honors from The Sporting News, Rivals.com and College Football News. He started the final 11 games of the year at free safety, replacing an injured Anthony Reddick. He ranked third on the team with 67 tackles (40 solo), adding three stops for losses, two quarterback pressures, two pass breakups, a fumble recovery and an interception.\r\nAs a sophomore, Phillips received third-team All-American honors from Rivals.com and was a second-team All-ACC choice, even though he missed the final three regular-season games with a broken thumb. He was one of eight Miami players selected to the 2006 ACC Academic Football Team and was named the team's Defensive Back of the Year. He made 54 tackles (39 solo) with six stops behind the line of scrimmage in ten games, starting at cornerback, free safety and strong safety. He also picked off four passes and deflected six others.\r\nAs a junior, Phillips was named All-American first-team by The NFL Draft Report, adding All-ACC first-team accolades. He started all 12 games at free safety, ranking second on the team with 82 tackles (54 solo). He registered six stops for losses and caused three fumbles. He also deflected five passes and came up with a pair of interceptions.\r\nPhillips announced after the 2007 season that he will enter the 2008 NFL Draft as an underclassman. Phillips was advised by Miami head coach Randy Shannon to return for his senior season should he not be projected to go in the top 15, but he conceded it would be tough to turn away from a first-round projection. \r\n''I definitely agree that if you're [projected] in the top 15 you should go,'' Phillips said. ``It's not every day that guys get the opportunity to live out the dream and play in the NFL.''"

                    "Compares To": "REED DOUGHTY-Washington...Barber played with alertness and urgency as a senior, so it might be a case of maturing later than expected. He is still a better defender when a play is in front of him than in man coverage and does not have great read-and-react skills. He has adequate playing speed and a marginal burst to recover, but does a good job of handling short-area receivers. His play on special teams will get him his roster spot, but he needs to continue to mature and display a solid work ethic, as he's cut quite a few corners in the past and needs to shed the \"lazy\" label.",
                    "Negatives": "Lacks the second gear and timed speed to handle receivers one-on-one on deep routes...Earlier in his career, his motor and work ethic ran hot and cold, but as he matured, he bought into the program, doing the little extras to get better...Has adequate change-of-direction agility and a marginal burst when attempting to recover when a receiver gets behind him...Struggles in the classroom, more out of laziness, but his low Wonderlic score is of concern...Better reacting to plays in front of him, but is slow to read hats and needs to be more alert to double moves...Has good strength, but ballcarriers can break his tackles when he takes a side rather than positioning to wrap and secure...Tends to get a little sloppy tackling in the open field, preferring to do most of his hitting in closed quarters...Sometimes allows too much cushion for receivers on deep routes and then lacks that sudden burst to get back to his man without overextending and lunging...Seems lost while trying to recover after the receiver gets by him...Takes poor angles in pursuit, taking himself out of the play as he will then get overaggressive to compensate (best when he angles and has a clear lane to pursue)...While possessing adequate quickness, he seems to lack that explosive initial step and top-end speed needed to handle assignments in the deep zone...More aggressive in run force, but must keep his hands active to prevent big blockers from getting into his chest...Gets too high in his stance, taking extra steps in transition...Will gather some when having to change direction, lacking suddenness...Despite four INTs as a senior, he lacks natural hands and ball skills, tending to trap the ball more often than extending for it.\r",
                    "Positives": "Positives...Has a well-built frame with broad shoulders, good upper-body muscle tone, especially in the chest and arms, tight waist, good bubble and tapered thighs and calves...Showed marked improvement hustling to the ball as a senior, as he had stretches where he would throttle down and disappear in games earlier in his career...Hard worker in the weight room, but did not show that same work ethic in the classroom...Finally advanced into the mode of watching game tape to prepare for his upcoming opponent, something he did not do his first few years in the program...Has adequate quickness coming out of his backpedal, but is more active and aggressive in run force...Has enough quickness to mirror short-area receivers, showing good explosion coming out of his breaks...Has developed a decent feel for the zone and is aware of the direction of the ball in flight...Has the functional closing burst needed to shrink the gap on the receivers in deep routes...Gets out of his backpedal sharply and is effective on switching off in the zone...Lacks fluid hip swerve and flexibility when turning, but somehow manages to put his body in front of the receiver to prevent the pass...Extends well for the ball in traffic...Fills the hole with force in run support...Has adequate pop when going low to make the wrap-up tackle...As a senior, he did a better job of reading backfield activity, doing a good job of reading the quarterback to get a jump on the ball...Times leaps well and his added bulk as a senior allowed him to win a fair share of jump-ball battles vs. bigger receivers...Uses his hands well to fend off blockers when closing on outside run plays...Gets his head turned to track the ball in flight, and is especially solid when trying to get a jump on screens...Needs a free lane when attacking the backfield on the blitz, but has developed a good feel for taking angles...Added to his resume on special teams, using his elevation well to block a few punts the last two years...More of a downhill player than one who will excel in the deep zone, but has the upper-body strength to make impact hits in space...Stays low in his pads to flow down the line and string out plays...Has enough strength to come up an play nickel linebacker in Cover-2 schemes.\r"

Dominique Barber's father, Marion Barber Jr., and brother, Marion Barber III (now with the Dallas Cowboys), both starred as running backs for the Gophers.\r\nAnd after limited playing time during his first two years at the university, Dominique Barber continued to uphold the family tradition, leading the team in tackles (100) in his final season.\r\nMinnesota generally redshirts incoming freshmen, but like his father and brother before him, Barber was on the field as a true freshman. He began his Gophers' career as a strong safety, moving to free safety as a sophomore and junior. His career came full circle as a senior, shifting back to free safety, where he became the third member of his family to attain All-Big Ten Conference status.\r\nBarber was rated as the 42nd-best player at his position in 2003 by Rivals and selected for the Super Prep Midwest Team, which ranked him as the nation's 58th-best player during his senior year at Wayzata High School. He was a Prep Star All-Midwest Region choice and named All-State and All-County his senior season at defensive back. He was an All-Area and All-Conference selection his senior season at running back.\r\nIn his final campaign, Barber had one interception, which he returned for a touchdown. He rushed for 911 yards on 138 carries with nine scores, while also recording 25 catches for 288 yards and three touchdowns. He also lettered twice in hockey and once in baseball.\r\nBarber was one of only three true freshmen to letter at Minnesota in 2003. He played in nine games, making four tackles (two solo) while breaking up a pass. He shifted to free safety as a sophomore, appearing in 12 games. He collected 13 tackles (10 solos) and blocked the first of three kicks during his career.\r\nIn 2006, Barber moved into the starting lineup at free safety, earning All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention. He blocked two kicks on special teams, picked off four passes and deflected four others. He finished fifth on the squad with 74 tackles (47 solos), as he recovered one fumble and caused two others.\r\nAs a senior, Barber's shift to strong safety saw him lead the team with 100 tackles (71 solo), picking up second-team All-Big Ten Conference honors in the process. He had one sack, 5.5 stops for losses and a forced fumble. He recovered three fumbles, advancing two for 53 yards and a touchdown, as he also broke up eight passes."

                    "Positives": "Lacks bulk on his lean frame, but shows good muscle tone, adequate bubble, good arm length, natural hands and tapered thighs and calves...Split high with good leg length, as his lower body looks and runs like a sprinter's...Has just adequate strength to fight for tough catches, but shows the sudden burst to elude in the open field...While he has sprinter's speed, it is not like that of a normal track man, as he has a rapid stride with quick feet and the lateral agility to get in and out of a crowd with his flexible torso and hips that lets him adjust on the move...Highly motivated and intense player who works to finish and is not afraid of contact, but needs to tone down his emotions (gets caught up in trash talk and is taken out of his game when he spends too much time jawing with an opponent)...Gives a good effort in the training room and is an intelligent athlete who knows how to game plan for his upcoming opponent...Can be a vocal leader when he needs to and can handle tough coaching...Shows outstanding explosion off the snap with excellent get-off speed...Quick-twitch type who might struggle vs. a strong press, but has the lateral agility to set up the defender and get the opponent out of his backpedal earlier than desired...Has a good rolling burst to his break point, doing a nice job of lowering his pads throughout the route's progression...When he sinks his pads, he is very fluid accelerating out of his breaks...Runs posts and slants cleanly and has a good understanding for stems, sticks and leverage (must improve transition)...Avoids defenders and works back to the pocket when the quarterback needs to scramble...Finds and sits in soft areas, waiting for the reception and has the rare speed to close the gap on off-man coverage, as he does a good job of extending and gaining a step for the over-the-shoulder grabs...Very creative on the move with fluid hips. He needs work on his transition cuts, but he can run past defenders on deep routes...Has good ability to extend and pluck the ball outside his frame, especially on off motion and swing routes...Will round routes at times, but has the ability to create separation after the catch...Holds on to the ball after the collision and, while he will not hesitate on routes coming inside, he will lose focus when he hears the defender's feet...Is a true threat to challenge the deep secondary, but in 2007, Cal quarterbacks could not get the ball to Jackson consistently...Has the body control to make adjustments to the ball in flight due to his torso flexibility and adjusts fluidly to off-target throws...Slides to catch the ball within the framework of his body and has good body control to adjust to off-target throws...Has the ability to make the hard plant, allowing the defender to slide by and then burst around his opponent to gain extra yardage after the catch...Does not back down and can drop his weight in front of a defender, but is just a marginal blocker.\r"

                "Overview": "DeSean Jackson declared for the 2008 NFL Draft on January 15, and it's safe to assume the only team in the Pac-10 Conference disappointed to see him go is Cal. \r\nIn three seasons at the university, the talented athlete terrorized his opponent every time he touched the ball -- as a receiver, punt returner and even on the occasional running play -- finding the end zone 29 times in 36 games.\r\nJackson almost didn't make it to California. He seriously considered enrolling at Southern California instead, but a late face-to-face meeting between the former Long Beach Poly High star and Bears head coach Jeff Tedford sealed the deal. Their extremely close relationship would later make Jackson's most difficult decision -- to leave school for the NFL, even harder to make, but the coach is convinced that his star pupil is ready to star at the next level.\r\nAt Long Beach Poly High School, Jackson was considered one the premier wide receivers in the nation. The Parade Magazine All-American was named the 2004 Glenn Davis Award winner by the Los Angeles Times as Southern California's Player of the Year and was a two-time member of the famed Long Beach Press-Telegram \"Best in the West\" first team.\r\nESPN.com's Tom Lemming rated Jackson as the fourth-best wide receiver in the country, Prep Star selected him an All-American and a member of its Dream Team Top 100 players, and Calhisports.com voted him the 2004 Mr. Football State Player of the Year. Super Prep ranked him 21st in its Elite 50 players in the nation and the fourth-best player in the state of California. Rivals.com rated him the third-best player in the Golden State area.\r\nJackson was Most Valuable Player of the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio, as he had seven receptions for 141 yards and passed for a 45-yard touchdown in leading the West squad to a 35-3 victory in a game that featured 80 of the nation's top players. He also sparkled in the Cali-Florida Bowl game, posting five catches for 145 yards and one score. \r\nAt Long Beach Poly, Jackson flagged down 60 passes for 1,075 yards for the CIF Southern Section championship team. He scored 15 touchdowns, eight of which covered at least 60 yards, including two on punt returns. In the CIF title game, he was a last-minute replacement on defense and responded with two interceptions, one of which he returned 68 yards for a touchdown to help fuel Long Beach Poly's 21-6 victory over Los Alamitos High. As a junior, he hunted down 43 passes for 821 yards and 11 touchdowns in earning first-team All-State accolades. \r\nInvolved in a heavy recruit war among California, Southern California, Florida, Florida State, LSU, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Arizona State, Jackson enrolled at California, Berkeley in 2005, but there was concern he'd never play. In high school, Jackson hit .380 and stole 20 bases his senior year and he was considered the third-best all-around athlete in the Major League Baseball draft prospect pool in 2005 by Baseball America. Teams knew it would take a huge signing bonus to keep Jackson away from football, so they passed.\r\nAs late as his 2006 season at California, Jackson was still having thoughts of playing baseball. \r\nIn 2005, Jackson became the first incoming Cal player to win the Glenn Davis Award since running back Russell White captured the award for Crespi High School in 1987. Jackson took over flanker duties for the Bears, starting 10 contests, as he sat out the Washington State clash with a shoulder injury. He had a decent freshman campaign, totaling 698 all-purpose yards. He caught 38 passes for 601 yards (15.8-yard average) and seven touchdowns, adding 48 yards on eight carries (6.0-yard average). As a preview of things to come in 2006, Jackson's only punt return produced a 49-yard touchdown vs. Sacramento State in his collegiate debut.\r\nAs a sophomore, Jackson was a consensus All-American and unanimous All-Pac 10 Conference first-team choice. He captured the inaugural Randy Moss Award as the top return man in the nation, leading the NCAA with 18.2 yards per punt return, as he ranked second in the Pac-10 with nine receiving touchdowns. He set school and Pac-10 records for season (four) and career punt return touchdowns (five) with a 95-yarder vs. Arizona. \r\nJackson had four 100-yard games and registered 28 plays of 20 or more yards. He hauled in 59 passes for 1,060 yards (18.9-yard average) and gained 19 yards on five carries. He amassed 455 yards on 25 punt returns and 38 yards on two kickoff returns, piling up 1,572 all-purpose yards.\r\nIn 2007, Jackson was bothered by a badly sprained left thumb and was forced to wear a cast in practices and was heavily taped during games. He also suffered a deep thigh contusion vs. Washington that would force him to sit out the season finale vs. Stanford. He still earned American Football Coaches Association All-American first-team honors. He was a second-team All-Pac-10 pick as a receiver and punt returner.\r\nDue to the injuries, he produced 762 yards and six touchdowns on 65 receptions (11.7-yard average). Jackson gained 132 yards with a score on 11 carries (12.0 avg) and returned only 12 punts for 129 yards (10.8 avg), including a 77-yard touchdown. He finished his junior campaign with 1,023 all-purpose yards.\r\nIn 36 games at California, Jackson started 34 games at flanker. He hauled in 162 passes for 2,423 yards (15.0-yard average) and 22 touchdowns. He carried 24 times for 199 yards (8.3 avg) and a score and also attempted one pass. On special teams, he gained 633 yards with six touchdowns on 38 punt returns (16.7 avg), 38 yards on two kickoff returns and recorded five solo tackles. He finished with 3,293 all-purpose yards, an average of 91.47 yards per game. For his career, he recorded 52 plays of 20 yards or more (23.0% of his 226 touches)."

                    "Compares To": "CARLOS ROGERS-Washington...Like Rogers, there is no questioning Jenkins' speed -- he can stay with any receiver on deep routes. However, like Rogers, he is not a good tackler and tends to shy away from lending run support. Jenkins has some hip stiffness that is evident in transition and marginal hands to make the interception. He will bite on pump fakes and doesn't have great ball anticipation skills. He might be a better fit at free safety, as his best assets are his quickness, making plays in front of him and generating a good press. Quite a few publications list him as the best cornerback prospect for the 2008 NFL Draft. If he is indeed the best, NFL receivers could be salivating. He is a fine athlete, but isn't ready to star at the next level.",
                    "Negatives": "Needs to show better anticipation skills, as he does a good job of handling the receiver but eyes the backfield too long and bites on misdirection and pump fakes...Has very good timed speed, but needs to generate looser hips, as he looks tight in that region when trying to transition...Has just adequate change-of-direction agility and does not always explode out of his turns to get on the hip and mirror the receiver...Might be a better fit for free safety, due to his good closing burst vs. plays in front of him. His adequate athletic ability makes him appear a bit slow when trying to break on the ball in flight...Lacks natural hands and good arm extension to pluck the ball at its highest point, as he had more than a few pass deflections that should be interceptions...Shows some hesitation breaking on the ball and lacks that natural feel to get a good break on the ball and anticipate routes...His best asset is his ability to press and reroute the receivers at the line, but as aggressive as he is with the pass catcher, he does not like coming up in run support, preferring that others make the tackle in tight areas...Must improve his upper-body strength, as he lacks pop on contact and is not really a solid wrap-up tackler (more of a collision-type tackler and ballcarriers can escape when he takes a side...Tends to sit back and wait for the play to come to him rather than get in an opponent's face and initiate contact...Must learn to keep his pad level down more often, as he gets too erect in his backpedal and when his base narrows, he fails to get a clean break out of transition...Has to develop a better feel for the ball in flight, as it is rare to see him jump many patterns...Has the second gear to recover when beaten, but if he would open his hips quicker, receivers won't be able to gobble up his cushion as much as they do...Has to develop better hand placement, as he has run into trouble with pass interference penalties (had a string of at least one penalty in five of six midseason games in 2007)...Has the functional strength to get the ballcarrier down, but must show more aggression and force behind his tackles... Has a bit of a hop in his footwork that needs to be corrected...Perhaps due to adequate ball recognition skills, he doesn't take good angles to close in run support and must keep his hands inside his frame or he struggles to shed blocks when asked to plug the rush lanes...Has one off-field issue, but the coaching staff vouches for his good character and work ethic...Considering his senior season was not a dominant one, he made what might be a costly decision by refusing to attend the Senior Bowl at the last moment.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a well-built frame with good upper-body muscle tone, tight waist and hips and good lower-body thickness...His best asset is his press coverage skill, as he has had good success in impeding the receiver's route progression...Hard worker in the training room and on the practice field, as he is more of a quiet leader-by-example type, but spends lots of his time mentoring the younger players and is a potential coaching candidate in the future...With his press ability and speed closing on plays in front of him, he could bring more value as a free safety (has Brian Dawkins-type qualities), as he does have experience at that position from his high school days and as a freshman at USF...Times his leaps well and has that long reach to get over and around the receiver to deflect the pass when in the trail position (does get a bit reckless, leading to pass interference calls)...Has adequate balance and body control going after off-target tosses...Is a little tight in his hips, but he has that explosive second gear to recover and the leaping ability to battle the taller receivers in jump-ball situations...Good special-teams performer who shows patience letting his protection set up and the burst through the seams to take the ball long distances...Is sometimes late to turn on the ball, but he has the quick feet and exceptional burst to recover...Lock-down cornerback who can generate strong hand swipes in attempts to reroute...Even with his hip stiffness, he has good acceleration and turnover on his breaks and, when he keeps good position on his man, he does a good job taking angles to cut off the play...Gets high on his heels in his backpedal, but does not stay in it for long...Not the quickest at recognizing routes, but when he does, he shows good urgency to close (much better awareness vs. plays in front of him)...It doesn't always translate on the field, but he does have the timed speed to make plays at the opposite end of the field...When he gets into proper position, he can defend vs. the pass, as he gets very good elevation to reach and deflect the throw at its highest point...Likes to tackle to the side rather than squaring up, but he has the functional strength to impact vs. smaller opponents.\r"

                "Overview": "Regarded as one of the nation's premier shutdown pass defenders, Jenkins teamed with Trae Williams to give the Bulls an outstanding cornerback combination. \r\nAlong with free safety Nate Allen and strong safety Carlton Williams, South Florida's secondary combined for 131 starts at USF.\r\nThe Bulls ranked eighth in the nation in passing efficiency defense (105.27 rating) in 2007 after ranking 11th nationally in 2006 (104.26) and 16th (109.38) in 2005, thanks largely to the performance of their right cornerback. Jenkins improved his draft stock, showing professional scouts that his blazing speed could also be used as a kickoff returner. On the first kickoff return for 2007, he set a school record with a 100-yard touchdown return vs. Cincinnati.\r\nJenkins was a standout safety at Bradenton Southeast High School, earning Super Prep All-American honors. He was rated the 27th player in Florida by the Orlando Sentinel's Bill Buchalter, and he was named first-team All-Gridiron by Sean Alveshire (FloridaKids.net), who picks the top players in the state regardless of their school's classification.\r\nThe first-team Class 3A All-State choice, Jenkins was selected by the Sarasota Herald Tribune as its Defensive Player of the Year. He was the District Player of the Year in 2002 after he recorded 42 tackles, two interceptions, one caused fumble, one fumble recovery, two blocked punts and two blocked field goals. He also played running back and led the team with 859 yards and 11 touchdowns that year.\r\nJenkins was heavily recruited by Florida, Florida State and Louisiana State, but decided to enroll at South Florida in 2004. He started three of the team's first four games at left cornerback, including the season opener vs. Tennessee Tech, but an ankle sprain forced him to sit out vs. Army and kept him from returning to the starting lineup for the rest of the year. He finished his first season with 27 tackles (19 solo), two forced fumbles and nine pass deflections. He also blocked a punt that he returned four yards.\r\nIn 2005, Jenkins shifted to right cornerback, starting all 12 games. He earned All-Big East Conference second-team honors, as he produced 38 tackles (33 solo) with a stop for a loss and two forced fumbles. He returned a punt 27 yards, intercepted two passes and broke up five others.\r\nJenkins had a sub-par junior campaign, starting the first 12 games at right cornerback, but played as a reserve vs. East Carolina in the Papajohns.com Bowl. He made just 27 tackles (18 solo) with a forced fumble, a fumble recovery and an interception. He batted away fifteen passes and gained 27 yards on two kickoff returns.\r\nDuring 2007 spring camp, Jenkins was arrested for misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest without violence after a fight erupted outside a bar he was attending a party for former USF linebacker Stephen Nicholas. Despite not being violent, police used a taser Jenkins and he was briefly suspended from the team.\r\nHe returned for fall camp, reclaiming his right cornerback spot, and went on to earn All-American and All-Big East Conference first-team honors. He recorded a career-high 41 tackles (31 solo) with four stops for losses. He intercepted three passes, deflected 12 others and averaged 30.4 yards on seven kickoff returns, including one touchdown.\r\nIn 48 games at South Florida, Jenkins started 40 contests, including 37 at right cornerback. He registered 133 tackles (101 solo) with six stops for losses of 26 yards and one quarterback pressure. He caused five fumbles and recovered another. He also broke up 41 passes and had six interceptions for 41 yards in returns. He gained 240 yards with a score on nine kickoff returns (26.7-yard average) and 31 yards on two punt returns, as he also blocked one kick."

What might scare off a few teams is that he showed up weighing 186 at the NFL Combine, but several weeks later at Kent State's Pro Day, he checked in at 177.

One of the fastest defensive backs in this class, he has become a true game-changer from his spot in the defensive backfield.\r\nNot only does Williams possess excellent quickness and leaping ability, pound-for-pound, he is one of the strongest tacklers in the league. He has earned \"Elite Flash\" status for prowess in weightlifting, speed and agility over the last two winters.\r\nWilliams was an All-State selection as a senior at Booker T. Washington High School. He also earned All-Region and All-Tidewater accolades. The two-time All-District pick lettered three times in football as a defensive back and also saw time as a receiver. As a senior, he had 10 interceptions and scored 10 touchdowns.\r\nIn 2003, Williams enrolled at Kent State. He redshirted, earning team Outstanding Defensive Scout honors from the coaching staff. The following season, he started five games at left cornerback, recording 27 tackles (16 solo). He broke up four passes and picked off two others, returning one 99 yards for a touchdown vs. Iowa, a school record. He also blocked a punt.\r\nAs a sophomore, Williams started all eleven games at defensive halfback. He posted 63 tackles (41 solo), fifth on the team, as he caused and recovered a fumble. He broke up nine passes and intercepted four others while also delivering a pair of stops behind the line of scrimmage.\r\nWilliams started 10 of 12 contests at defensive halfback in 2006. He totaled 62 tackles (40 solo) and was used more on the blitz, coming up with three sacks, six stops for losses and two pressures. He tied for the national lead by causing five fumbles, recovering four while also deflecting four passes. He had four interceptions, returning one for a score and averaged 20.3 yards on six kickoff returns.\r\nAs a senior, Williams earned All-Mid American Conference second-team honors. He missed the Temple game and the second half of the Northern Illinois clash with a shoulder sprain suffered making a tackle vs. NIU. He produced a career-high 93 tackles (70 solo), ranking second on the team. He added 6.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage, recovering two fumbles and causing another.

                "Overview": "Branch possesses exceptional range and good ball skills in the secondary, but he made a name for himself as a kickoff returner in 2007, establishing school records while leading the Big East Conference with an average of 28.89 yards per return. Regarded as the fastest cornerback in college football, his ability to compete for the ball in flight and make plays in run support could see him shift to free safety at the next level.\r\nThe only Connecticut player to ever return two kickoffs for touchdowns in the same season, Branch was the most experienced defensive back on the squad last year. Since taking over right cornerback duties as a junior, he has grown into his leadership role and the staff feels he could one day make an ideal coach, as he makes the extra effort to mentor and work out with the team's younger players.\r\nBranch attended Cicero-North Syracuse High School, where he earned second-team All-State, All-Central New York and All-Area honors as a tailback and outside linebacker for the Northstars. He also excelled in track, and was the recipient of the Gatorade New York State Track Athlete of the Year Award after winning the 2004 National Indoor Track Championship in the 60 meters (6.82). He finished first in the state in both the 100 and 200 meters as a senior, setting a school record with a 10.60-second clocking in the 100-meter dash.\r\nBranch was expected to accept a scholarship to local Syracuse, but opted to enroll at Connecticut instead. He played mostly on special teams in 2004, but became the only true freshman to start a game that year, taking over left cornerback duties for the Georgia Tech game. He recorded at least one tackle in every game, except vs. Pittsburgh, finishing with 20 tackles (12 solos) while averaging 20.0 yards on ten kickoff returns.\r\nIn May, 2005, Branch was one of five Connecticut football players arrested after an incident in which the window of a motor vehicle was shot out. The driver's-side window of a vehicle driven by a 55-year-old woman was shot out by a pellet gun as two vehicles passed each other in a parking lot, and the suspects fled the scene in a white sport utility vehicle, the police said. A few minutes later, the police located the suspects and the vehicle. They were all charged with possession of a weapon in a motor vehicle and released after posting $750 bond. \r\nBranch spent the first part of the 2005 campaign playing in reserve. He took over right cornerback duties at midseason, starting the final five games and his next 30 contests in the lineup. He produced 42 tackles (21 solos) with an assisted sack, four pass break-ups and two interceptions. His play in the secondary helped the team rank sixth in the nation in total defense, allowing just 297.18 yards per game.\r\nIn 2006, Branch registered 79 tackles (47 solos) with four stops behind the line of scrimmage for the Big East Conference's second-ranked secondary that gave up 178.5 yards per game. He caused and recovered two fumbles, broke up four passes and also picked off another.\r\nEven though he led the Big East and ranked 13th nationally with an average of 28.89 yards per kickoff return, scoring twice, Branch was only named a second-team All-Conference choice in 2007. He gained 780 yards on 27 attempts, as his two touchdown returns set season and career records at Connecticut. He ranked fifth on the team with a career-high 89 tackles (53 solos), including three stops for losses, a forced fumble and 10 pass deflections.\r\nIn 48 games at Connecticut, Branch started 31 contests. He recorded 224 tackles (133 solos) with an assisted sack for minus-4 yards and 7.5 stops for losses of 32 yards. He caused three fumbles and recovered two others, advancing one 8 yards. He posted 18 pass deflections and three interceptions for 15 yards in returns. He also returned 37 kickoffs for 980 yards (26.5 avg) and a pair of touchdowns."

Both have a very good ability for placing their kicks inside the 20-yard line. Outside of Scifres, no one in the NFL can match Brooks' hang time (just needs to be more consistent). Look for Brooks to be the first punter taken in the draft. It's fitting that he won the Ray Guy Award in 2007, as Guy has been a family friend and mentor.",

Has good athletic skills, adequate strength and timed speed, yet did not register any tackles in his role as the safety valve on the coverage units...Seems a bit reluctant to get involved in contact as a tackler, preferring to let others handle that job...Has handled just punting duties throughout his college career and can't be considered even an emergency fill-in as a place-kicker or kickoff specialist.\r",

Hard worker in the weight room (one-of-the-guys type who does not have a typical kicker's mentality) and has been a fine example and leader for the team's younger players...Has the timed speed to get down field and support the coverage unit (seems to shy away from contact, though)...Is always very well prepared for his upcoming opponent, putting in the extra hours in the film room studying the punt returner's tendencies...Makes good mental adjustments on the field and thrives in pressure situations, doing a good job of blocking out any distractions on the field...Has the leg strength to explode into the ball on contact, as his punts accelerate at a very fast pace, getting good rise to prevent blocks...Fields the ball cleanly and has the large, soft hands, along with timing and leaping ability to adjust to poor snaps...Has the ability to launch very long kicks on a steady basis (57 for 50 yards or more the last two years, an NCAA record)...Has a very respectable catch-to-kick timing of 1.25-1.28 seconds, showing no wasted motion in his follow-through, getting the ball of quickly...The ball comes off his foot sharply, demonstrating excellent follow-through and extension to get a very good rise on his kicks...Very effective at getting the ball right down the middle of the field and showed marked improvement with his angles on pooch punts as a senior compared to 2006 (sideline placement is starting to become his specialty)...Is rarely affected by poor weather conditions and knows how to kick into the wind for distance...Poised under pressure and will not let a bad kick affect his performance...Also contributes as a holder for field goals and placements.\r"

                "Junior College": "Brooks enrolled at Georgia Military College, spending two years punting for head coach Bert Williams...Averaged nearly 40 yards per punt over his two seasons.",
                "Overview": "This time, the Ray Guy Award voters got it right, as Brooks was the recipient of the 2007 award after finishing as a finalist in 2006. It was appropriate that he was named to the award, as many in the industry feel that he is the finest punter to play at the collegiate level since Ray Guy himself. Ironically, Guy has been a family friend and Brooks' mentor.\r\nAlong with kicker Travis Bell, Brooks gave the Yellow Jackets the best kicking tandem in the ountry. Boasting a 40.66-yard net average, the Tech punter ranked fourth in the nation with a 45.52-yard gross punting average in 2006, As a senior, he finished fifth nationally with a 45.06-yard average and a 40.58-yard net average.\r\nBrooks' career average of 45.31 yards per punt attempt set an Atlantic Coast Conference all-time record and is the fourth-highest average in NCAA annals. His 57 punts for 50 yards or longer over his last two seasons set another NCAA mark. No punter in college football has been able to amass a net-yard average that the Tech athlete accomplished (43.4 avg).\r\nLittle was known about Brooks before he arrived at Georgia Tech as a transfer in 2005. He lettered three years for head coach Barney Hester at Tattnall Square Academy, where he helped lead the team to the 2001 GISA state title. He was also a basketball standout, averaging 18 points per game and setting the school record for career three-pointers. \r\nAfter graduation, Brooks enrolled at Georgia Military College, spending two years punting for head coach Bert Williams. He averaged nearly 40 yards per punt over his two seasons. \r\nIn 2005, he joined the Tech program, sitting out the season while performing on the scout team.\r\nBrooks wasted no time garnering national media attention for his towering punts at Tech in 2006. He earned All-American and All-Atlantic Coast Conference honors, in addition to being a finalist for the Ray Guy Award. He punted 79 times for 3,596 yards (45.52 avg) with 35 attempts that were downed inside the 20-yard line. He had 33 kicks returned, but the opposition managed just 164 yards, with no return longer than 18 yards, as he posted a 40.66-yard net average. He also had 27 of his punts go for 50 yards or longer.\r\nAs a senior, Brooks captured All-American and All-ACC first-team accolades, to go along with winning the Ray Guy Award. He amassed 2,929 yards on 65 attempts (45.06 avg), placing 33 inside the 20-yard line. He had 30 punts for 50 yards or longer, two shy of the NCAA single-season record. The opposition called for 21 fair catches and returned only 19 of his punts for 111 yards (5.8 avg), with none longer than 14 yards. That gave him a 40.58-yard net average.\r\nIn two seasons at Georgia Tech, Brooks shattered school and conference career records with an average of 45.31 yards on 144 punts for 6,525 yards. He had 20 kicks go for touchbacks and 68 attempts that were downed inside the 20-yard line. The opposition called for 30 fair catches and returned 52 other kicks for 275 yards (5.29 avg), finishing with a 40.63-yard net average.\r\nBrooks put on a sensational show during Senior Bowl practices that NFL coaches are still raving about. Brooks stepped into his first punt of the day during Tuesday's session and sent it sailing. As the ball continued to fly past the other sideline and then over the head of Tampa Bay head coach Jon Gruden, Gruden simply looked up at the ball and asked, \"Is that serious?\" \r\nThe fact is, punts like those are not only serious for Brooks, but they have become routine. \"Durant is a great talent,\" 49ers head coach Mike Nolan said. \"I don't think teams are going to be able to sit around and hope he falls to them.\" \r\nAfter Tuesday's practice featured the length of Brooks' punts, Wednesday focused more on directional and pooch punting drills. With the NFL scouts already aware of his leg strength, Brooks proved he could consistently down the ball inside the 10-yard line. \"Everyone knows that Durant can kick the ball a good ways, but what's underrated is how incredible his hang time is,\" one scout said. \"When you're trying to punt the ball inside the 20 it's all about hang time, and Durant does it better than anybody.\""

With Army loosening its military requirements, he will be allowed to play NFL ball in 2008, rather than sit out a few years.

                "Overview": "Bruce Davis is a high-energy, talkative pass rusher who will more likely move to outside linebacker at the next level. \r\nKnowing Oakland Raiders' owner Al Davis' affection for legacies, putting Bruce in silver and black isn't out of the question. Bruce Davis, Sr., was a member of two Super Bowl championship teams, playing offensive tackle with the Raiders (1979-87) and Houston Oilers (1987-89) after earning varsity letters from 1975-78 with the UCLA Bruins.\r\nHaving patterned his style of play after Miami's Jason Taylor, Bruce Davis Jr. showed during Senior Bowl practices that he might still be raw playing linebacker, but also displayed the athleticism and urgency in his play to do whatever it takes to get to the quarterback consistently. Despite giving up more than 50 pounds to opposing offensive tackles, Davis ranked second in school history with 29 quarterback sacks and third with 42.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage.\r\nAt Clear Creek High School, Davis received a six-star prospect rating from Max Emfinger's recruiting service and earned All-American accolades, in addition to being ranked 19th among the nation's defensive ends, according to Tom Lemming. He added Super Prep All-American and All-Southwest/Texas honors, as that recruiting service rated him the 20th-best overall prospect in the state.\r\nThe Prep Star All-American selection added All-Greater Houston area and All-League recognition as a senior. That season, he recorded 65 tackles (50 solo), 12 quarterback sacks and 17 stops for losses. As a junior, he registered 32 tackles, including eight sacks. He also lettered in track, competing in the long jump.\r\nDavis originally agreed to attend the University of Arkansas, but later changed his mind and enrolled at his father's alma mater. During the 2003 season, he redshirted as a defensive end for the Bruins. The following season, Davis started the team's first two games at right defensive end, sharing that position with Justin Hickman and Brigham Harwell the rest of the year. He posted 17 tackles (11 solo) with 2.5 sacks and broke up one pass.\r\nDavis shifted to strong-side linebacker prior to the 2005 campaign. Due to injuries, he also competed at defensive end that year. In 12 contests as a reserve, he was in on 28 tackles (17 solos) with a pair of sacks and six stops for losses. He also caused a fumble and showed his coverage skills by deflecting four passes.\r\nBack at right defensive end, the coaching staff unleashed Davis while moving Hickman to the left side. Both of those players ended up with the team and Pac-10 Conference lead, while ranking fourth nationally with 12.5 sacks, the third-best season total in school annals. \r\nDavis ranked second in the league with 17.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage and produced 47 tackles (35 solos) while causing three fumbles and recovering two others. Even though he earned first-team All-American honors from College Football News, the league's coaches only selected him to the All-Pac 10 Conference second-team.\r\nAs a senior, Davis garnered All-American second-team and All-Pac-10 first-team honors. He started all year at right end, pacing the league while ranking ninth nationally with 12 sacks. He led the Bruins with 15.5 stops for losses, as he caused two fumbles and recovered another. He broke up nine passes and registered 45 tackles (32 solo).\r\nIn 50 games at UCLA, Davis started 28 contests at right defensive end. He recorded 137 tackles (95 solos) with 29 sacks for minus 170 yards and 42.5 stops for losses of 229 yards. He posted five quarterback pressures and deflected seventeen passes. He caused six fumbles and recovered three others, returning two for a total of 20 yards."

He is an intriguing prospect who played his collegiate career as a 4-3 defensive tackle, but proved in postseason competition that he could also develop into an efficient \"five-technique\" defensive end in a 3-4 alignment. \r\nInjuries limited Dotson during his first three seasons at Arizona. He battled through neck, ankle, shoulder and hamstring issues. Fully recovered as a senior, he produced 6.5 of his 10.5 career sacks and nine of the 14.5 stops he recorded behind the line of scrimmage as a Wildcat.\r\nDotson has athletics in his family. His grandfather, Leon Bedford, played football at Southern University. His father, Lionel, was a basketball player at the University of Houston. His uncle, Vance Bedford, played football at Texas and a year for the St. Louis Cardinals and is an assistant coach at Florida.\r\nAt Dobie High School, Dotson was a Texas Top 100 pick by all three major metropolitan dailies, the Dallas Morning News, Houston Chronicle and Fort Worth Star-Telegram. He added Super Prep All-Southwest, Rivals100 Top 25, Prep Star All-Midlands and Texas Nifty 150 (Max Emfinger) honors.

He also received the U.S. Marine Corps Award for distinguished athletes.\r\nDotson arrived at the University of Arizona in 2003, but was granted a medical hardship after he suffered a neck injury in fall camp. He started six of the seven games he played in during 2004, lining up at right defensive tackle. He produced 19 tackles (seven solo) with three sacks and 3.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage.\r\nAs a sophomore, Dotson missed the Stanford contest due to an ankle sprain, starting four of 10 games he appeared in at right tackle. He managed 21 tackles (10 solo), but did not record any stops for losses. He broke up three passes, recovered a fumble and caused another.\r\nA left shoulder injury and hamstring tear sidelined Dotson for the final two games of 2006 vs. Oregon and Arizona State. He started the first 10 games at right tackle, posting 31 tackles (15 solo), a sack and two stops for losses. He also caused a fumble.\r\nDotson's shoulder issues continued through fall camp, but he went on to start every game in 2007, earning second-team All-Pac-10 honors. The right tackle delivered 50 tackles (36 solo), as he led the team with 6.5 sacks and ranked second on the squad with nine stops behind the line of scrimmage.

                "Overview": "A dominating presence in the middle of the field, most of Florida State's success in stopping the run in recent years has been with Fluellen clogging the rush lanes. Much of the Seminoles' failures on defense were the result of their defensive leader being on the sidelines with a left elbow hyperextension in 2007.\r\nCalled by ESPN as one of the \"Ten Seniors to Watch\" in 2007, Fluellen started just five times due to his injury, but proved to be a defensive force as opponents averaged just 1.74 yards per carry on plays directed at him the last two seasons. His consistency on the field caused the coaching staff to state that he is equal or better than two recent first-round draft choices who played on the FSU defensive line, Brodrick Bunkley (Philadelphia) and Travis Johnson (Houston). \r\nFluellen was rated a three-star prospect by Rivals.com as a senior at Cartersville High School. That service also rated him the 28th-best defensive lineman in the country and gave him Georgia Top 50 status. He excelled as a two-way tackle and held the team record with a 345-pound bench press.\r\nAs a senior, Fluellen registered 93 tackles, adding 11 sacks. He posted 88 tackles, 10 sacks, six forced fumbles and scored two touchdowns during his junior campaign.\r\nAt Florida State, Fluellen red-shirted in 2003. He appeared in 12 games in 2004, as he saw action mostly with the special teams or late in games on defense. He finished with six tackles (4 solos), a stop behind the line of scrimmage and two pass deflections.\r\nAs a sophomore, Fluellen took over left defensive tackle duties, starting every game, except vs. The Citadel, sitting out that contest after suffering a left biceps muscle strain vs. Miami. He posted 26 tackles (8 solos) with three sacks, 7.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage and a quarterback pressure.\r\nIn 2006, Fluellen was the recipient of the team's Bill McGrotha/Spirit Humanitarian Award. He started all 13 games, lining up at left defensive tackle for the first two contests before shifting over to nose guard for the balance of the schedule. He ranked seventh on the team with 28 tackles (16 solos) that included an assisted sack and eight stops behind the line of scrimmage.\r\nFluellen was named to several preseason All-American and All-Atlantic Coast Conference teams, in addition to earning a berth on the Bednarik Award Watch List (nation's top defensive player) in 2007, but managed to start only five games, missing three entire contests with his elbow injury. He still managed to come up with 21 tackles (10 solos), including two sacks, one pressure and a pair of pass deflections."

While opposing offenses challenged Fontenot often rather than work on Cason's side, and Fontenot turned the steady activity into impressive production -- 174 tackles (130 solo), seven interceptions and 25 pass breakups -- starting all 46 games in which he played for Arizona.\r\nFontenot was a three-way threat at Humble High School, seeing action as a running back, cornerback and return specialist. He earned All-Texas Class 5A honors after leading the team to 10 consecutive victories in the regular season and an 11-2 record through the state semifinals as a senior.

He finished his final season with 40 tackles, three interceptions and four pass deflections.\r\nAfter redshirting in 2003 at Arizona, Fontenot moved into the starting lineup at field cornerback in 2004, going on to start his next 46 contests. He earned Freshman All-Pac-10 Conference honors from The Sporting News and was named Pac-10 Player of the Week after returning a fumble recovery 33 yards for a score vs. Washington. He posted 46 tackles (34 solo) with two stops for losses and caused a fumble. He had a total of three fumble recoveries, as he also deflected four passes and picked off two others.\r\nAs a sophomore, Fontenot missed spring drills after undergoing right knee arthroscopic surgery. Fully recovered by the fall, he totaled 51 tackles (36 solo), third-best on the team. He had two interceptions with six pass deflections and even got to carry the ball once, but it was for a three-yard loss.\r\nFontenot was bothered by a right shoulder injury in 2006, undergoing arthroscopic surgery after the season. His tackle totals fell to a career-low 37 (31 solo), including two stops for losses, as he also deflected eight passes. He continued to man the field cornerback position in his final season, delivering 40 tackles (29 solo) and an interception. He also had seven pass deflections and assisted on a stop for a loss."

                "Overview": "A gifted athlete who has excelled on the football field and the classroom, Goff had an opportunity to leave school early for the NFL last year, but decided to return to school. It turned out to be a great decision, as he elevated his draft stock into the early rounds with another stellar campaign in 2007, thanks largely to his dedication during the offseason in Vanderbilt's renowned training program. \r\nRegarded as of the top track athletes in the nation during his high school days, Goff never played middle linebacker until arriving at Vanderbilt. One of the highest academic achievers in the state of Massachusetts, he was chosen to attend John Hopkins University's gifted and talented student program as a teenager. He was a member of the National Honor Society during his high school days and has garnered Academic All-Southeastern Conference honors.\r\nOn the field, the Vanderbilt staff regarded Goff as their \"most complete\" player. He became just the 10th player in school annals to lead the team in tackles in consecutive seasons, posting 93 hits in 2006 and 113 more in 2007. With their two-time team captain back playing for them in 2007, Vanderbilt improved from being ranked 74th in the nation in total offense in 2006 to 16th nationally in 2007, allowing just 325.25 yards per game.  \r\n\"Jonathan gives us great effort and tries his very best every play to do what we coach him to do, and he does it full speed,\" Vanderbilt head coach Bobby Johnson said. \"He's a very, very fine football player. You know when he goes out there he's going to play well. He does everything. He is good in his pass drops. He is good against the run. He's the kind of guy who just goes out and makes plays for you.\"\r\nGoff's mother, Gwendolyn Tyre, who was the first African-American law clerk on the Georgia Supreme Court, forbade him from playing until he attended St. John's Prep. He went on to become a three-year starter and captain for the Boston area power. He started at safety and receiver as a sophomore, safety, receiver and quarterback as a junior, and tailback and outside linebacker as a senior.\r\nGoff helped the team post undefeated regular season records in 2001 and 2002. He rushed for 920 yards for 104 attempts in 2002 and also passed for nine touchdowns and ran for 642 yards as junior quarterback. The two-time All-Conference selection added Prep Star All-East honors as a senior, he also started for the basketball and track-and-field squads and was one of the state's top track performers, bests of 11.0 (100 meters) and 151 feet (discus throw). \r\nIn 2003, Goff enrolled at Vanderbilt, but spent the year with the scout team. He started the final four games of the 2004 season at middle linebacker, recording 38 tackles (27 solos) while also causing one fumble. Firmly entrenched in the middle, he would go on to start \r\n10 games at that spot in 2005, despite being limited in the preseason after he suffered a partial knee ligament tear in spring camp. He ranked third on the team with 63 tackles (47 solos), a sack and three stops for losses.\r\nOver the next two seasons, Goff would earn All-Southeastern Conference second-team honors both years, serving as squad captain. He registered a team-high 93 tackles (67 solos), 2.5 sacks and six stops for losses as a junior. He also caused two fumbles and picked off a pass.\r\nThe 2007 season saw Goff added All-American honorable mention to his resume. He paced the Commodores with 113 tackles (67 solos), the fourth-best total in the SEC, as he also added three sacks, 6.5 stops for losses and six pressures. He picked off two passes and deflected five others.\r\nIn 46 games at Vanderbilt, Goff started 38 contests. He collected 307 tackles (202 solos) with 6.5 sacks for minus-45 yards, 15.5 stops for losses of 67 yards and 13 quarterback pressures. He caused three fumbles, deflected nine passes and gained 12 yards on three interception returns. He also blocked one kick."

He was part of the school's academic cheating scandal that saw 36 football players ruled ineligible for postseason action. With just 66 tackles to his credit over 32 games, his resume does not give professional teams much to base their evaluation on. \r\nConsidering his pedestrian performance at the NFL Combine, Guion might have been better served returning to school in 2008.

He appeared in eight games on defense and two more on special teams as a true freshman in 2005, earning his first career start vs. The Citadel at left defensive tackle. He went on to post 10 tackles (3 solos) with a pair of stops for losses.\r\nGuion appeared in 12 games in 2006, seeing limited action early in the season before taking over left defensive tackle chores for the Seminoles' final five games.

He has also shown the same accomplishments in the classroom, having graduated in December 2007 with a 3.0 grade point average, earning Dean's List and Academic All-Big Ten Conference accolades.\r\nAfter playing on offense and defense as a true freshman, he went on to start every game at right cornerback the last two seasons. During that time, he deflected 21 passes and intercepted three others. After a stellar performance at the 2008 NFL Combine, King proved that athletically, he is more than ready to take on the daunting task of playing professional football at the young age of 20.\r\nPlaying for Penn State seemed to be a natural thing to do for King, whose step-father, Terry Smith, played as a wide receiver for head coach Joe Paterno and the Nittany Lions for 1988-91. Smith would coach King during his playing days at Gateway High School. The youngster announced on the night of Nov. 15, 2004 that he would enroll at Penn State, arriving on campus in January 2005. \r\nShortly thereafter, King began contacting other premier players across the nation who were considering Penn State, asking them to join him to help PSU win Big Ten Conference and national championships. Within days of King's announcement, other top prep players began giving Paterno their commitments, including Derrick Williams, the nation's top-rated player. Before he finished \"campaigning,\" King and fellow Gateway High tight end Jon Ditto were joined by 13 other prep prospects from Western Pennsylvania to wear a Nittany Lions uniform. \r\nKing was rated the nation's top cornerback and the top player in Pennsylvania at Gateway High School. He played in the U.S. Army All-America Bowl, was the 2004 Gatorade Pennsylvania Player-of-the-Year and a first-team All-State selection by numerous media outlets. He shared the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review Player-of-the-Year honor and was a member of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Fabulous 22 and the Harrisburg Patriot-News Platinum 33 squads. He was co-winner of the Mercury Award, presented annually to the top player in Western Pennsylvania, and was a Parade All-American.\r\nKing led the team to an 11-2 mark in his senior season and the Western Pennsylvania District 7 Class AAAA title game. He rushed for 1,902 yards and 33 touchdowns on 208 attempts, and also had nine receptions for 180 yards and three scores. Defensively, he collected 25 tackles and an interception. As a junior, King rushed for 1,763 yards and 29 touchdowns. For his career, he carried the ball 544 times for 4,519 yards, the third-highest total in District 7 Class AAAA history, and scored 59 touchdowns. King also was an accomplished sprinter on the track-and-field team for two years. \r\nA Freshman All-American selection by The Sporting News as a multiple-position true freshman in 2005, King started five of 12 games as a slot receiver/split end, in addition to seeing reserve duty at right cornerback. He delivered 11 tackles (9 solos) with two pass deflections. He gained 227 yards on 18 carries (12.6 avg), 126 yards with a pair of touchdowns on 10 receptions and 40 yards on three kickoff returns (13.3 avg).\r\nWith the graduation of Anwar Phillips, King concentrated on right cornerback duties in 2006. He totaled 30 tackles (22 solos) with six pass deflections and an interception. He earned Academic All-Big Ten Conference and second-team All-Big Ten accolades.\r\nKing's 2007 season was actually two-phased, as the first-team All-Big Ten Conference pick started the year showing excellent coverage skills, allowing 18 catches for 227 yards (12.6 avg) with no touchdowns through the first six games. He did not allow any receptions vs. Illinois and Wisconsin. The second half of the campaign saw him struggle considerably, as he was charged with 490 yards and six touchdowns on 32 grabs (15.3 avg). He finished the year with 49 tackles (36 solos), 15 pass deflections, two interceptions and a fumble recovery while starting all 13 games."

                    "Compares To": "DAVID BARRETT-New York Jets...Like Barrett, Lee is the type of player a team might put in the lineup, but only if it has few other options. He is certainly not a playmaker and don't be fooled by his four interceptions in 2007 (three came on throws right to him), as he lacks field awareness and is fooled more on the field than a child at his first magician's show. Lee just does not have the burst, range or fluid hips to mirror receivers on deep routes and gets fooled often by double moves and pump fakes. Outside of his duties as a gunner on special teams, he brings little value to the draft table.",
                    "Negatives": "Does no always play up to his timed speed, as he lacks fluidity coming out of his backpedal and fails to generate an explosive burst to recover when a receiver gets behind him...Takes slow, choppy steps in his pedal and stays too tall in his stance, preventing him from opening his hips to turn and run on the ball...Plays too tentative, allowing a big cushion while hesitating to come up and try to press the receiver at the line of scrimmage...Despite his success intercepting the ball as a senior, he lacks natural hands, letting the ball into his body rather than extending for it...Also has poor timing and despite his good leaping skills, his lack of awareness to the ball in flight prevents him from getting vertical in attempts to compete for the jump ball...Has marginal plant-and-drive agility that results in him failing to mirror receivers on patterns...Slow to recognize the ball and will generally get a late start in attempts to close...Gets fooled often by a savvy receiver, as he always bites on hip wiggle/shake and double moves...Tries to compensate for his poor mirror ability by grabbing at his opponent, which leads to a rash of pass interference calls...Does not have the closing speed to recover when a receiver eats up his cushion...Can close on plays in front of him, but needs to show more courage when playing in the box, as he shies away from contact...When a blocker gets into his body, he has poor hand usage to combat and struggles to disengage...Lacks sideline range, as his stiff hips prevent him from closing with any urgency on perimeter plays...Needs to improve his eyes and awareness playing in the zone, as a quarterback can take him out of the action because he generally bites on misdirection and pump fakes...Needs more than a few reps to retain and will struggle trying to digest a complicated playbook.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a track man's body with lean muscle definition, long limbs and very good timed speed, but struggles to open his hips and turn fluidly on the ball, which negates some of his quickness...Shows good body control making plays in front of him, but has a choppy backpedal which causes him to false step in transition...Has average leaping ability, showing good explosion going up for the ball, but must do a better job timing his leaps (fails to get to the ball at its high point due to poor timing)...Keeps position and anticipates breaks and cuts well when asked to handle man coverage in the short area, but must flip his hips better when trying to mirror on deep routes...Sees routes develop better when playing the zone, showing adequate three-step reactions and timing in his pass drops, but will bite on pump fakes...Takes good angles coming off breaks on deep passes, but must do a better job when trying to high point the ball....Best asset is his straight-line speed, which gets him downfield in a hurry as a gunner on special teams to break up the wedge...Has good upper body strength, but it would be even more effective if he learns how to use wrap-up technique (ankle bites too much when tackling)...Well-built athlete, but with his stiff hip issues and adequate hands, he might be a better fit as a safety than on the corners...Showed in limited opportunities that his speed and straight-line burst could be very effective serving on kickoff returns.\r"

                "Overview": "This late bloomer intercepted just one pass in his first 41 games at Auburn, but found being a pass thief to his liking as a senior. During a five-game midseason span, he pulled in four interceptions for the Tigers in 2007. Two of those thefts set up Auburn touchdowns and another led to a field goal.\r\nNot known for his tackling ability, Lee managed to put together a string of making at least one tackle in his final 20 contests. He also added to his resume by taking on kickoff return duties as a senior, averaging 25.8 yards per return.\r\nAt Christopher Columbus High School, Lee earned Super Prep All-Dixie and Florida Times Union Super 75 honors. He was named one of the top five cornerbacks in Florida by the Florida Times Union and received second-team All-Dade County honors.\r\nLee started at free safety during his last two seasons. He recorded 70 tackles, five broken up passes, three interceptions, two fumble recoveries and two blocked kicks. He returned one interception 75 yards for a touchdown and also returned 14 kickoffs for 256 yards, including one for an 85-yard touchdown. He also competed in track, winning the state championship in the long jump with a leap of 23'10\". \r\nLee red-shirted in 2003 at Auburn. He appeared in 12 games as a reserve cornerback in 2004, posting 14 tackles (12 solos) with a stop for a 2-yard loss and a pass break-up. He took over right cornerback chores as a sophomore, starting the first five games, but after coming up with just seven tackles as a starter, he spent the rest of the season as a reserve, finishing with nine hits (7 solos) and three pass deflections.\r\nLee shared right cornerback duties with Jonathan Wilhite, starting four of 12 games he played in. He totaled 25 tackles (15 solos) with a stop for a loss, coming up with his first career interception. He also caused a fumble that he recovered and advanced 20 yards for a touchdown.\r\nAs a senior, Lee earned All-Southeastern Conference second-team honors. He averaged 25.8 yards on 11 kickoff returns and started all season at right cornerback. He was in on a career-high 55 tackles (40 solos), ranking sixth on the team.

                    "Compares To": "MICHAEL BOLEY-Atlanta...Adibi's quickness and range will get him drafted earlier than his production, as was the case with Boley. While an inside linebacker in college, he will probably have to shift to weak-side linebacker in the NFL. He is not the most instinctive locating the ball to play in the middle and lacks good hand placement and punch to separate from blocks at the strong-side spot. He does have the loose hips to get depth in pass drops, and could make the move to strong safety. Reminds some of former Florida State linebacker Michael Boulware, who was drafted and converted to strong safety by the Seahawks. He's improved his overall bulk, but despite good weight-room numbers, he has yet to translate that strength to the football field. Still, Boley was not exactly a strongman himself when he entered the league, but developed into a solid weak-side linebacker.",
                    "Negatives": "Has added needed bulk to his frame, but has just adequate upper-body muscle development and smooth arms...Despite his weight-room strength, power does not always translate to the playing field and he needs to attack the ball with better pop on contact rather than arm tackle...Does not have the hand strength needed to reroute tight ends and backs in the passing game...Has good field vision, but is a bit slow reading and reacting to the play and must be quicker in his diagnostic skills...Gets tied up often when trying to engage the larger blockers and needs to be more active with his hands in attempts to shed...Even when he gets into position and stays low in his pads, he fails to generate enough force behind his hits to drive the ballcarrier back...Has to work on his tackle technique, as he does not always attack the outside leg of the ballcarrier and spends more time grabbing at the runner rather than driving through with his hits...Has good lateral agility, but needs to be more alert to his surroundings, as he will trip over bodies on the ground rather than side-stepping the trash...Better fit as an outside linebacker, where his speed would be put to better use, as he also struggles to sift through traffic when playing in the middle...More suited for weak-side than on the strong-side...Needs a free lane in order to pressure the pocket, as he gets ping-ponged often trying to shoot the inside gaps and he lacks the anchor to sit and clog the rush lanes...Must develop better counter moves and keep his hands inside his frame better when trying to disengage from blocks...Must be more alert to pre-snap movement and the cadence of the snap to reduce his off-side penalties...Gets a bit reckless in his pursuit and, while he has good foot speed, he takes false steps and needs to throttle down a bit to redirect when he outruns the play...More of a drag-down, ankle-biter as a tackler than one with classic wrap-up technique.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a tight midsection, very long arms, with a good reach and natural hands to extend and catch the ball outside his frame...Has improved his overall bulk, but still has room on his frame for more weight without having it impact his quickness...Has very good hip flexibility and change-of-direction skills, getting good depth on his pass drops for a potential shift to weak-side linebacker or strong safety...Lacks the strength to play in the middle or on the strong side, but will combat at the point of attack...Has a sudden first step and balance to slip past and avoid blockers in traffic...Plays with good football intelligence and awareness but needs to read the snap count better to prevent penalties...Plays until the whistle and shows toughness taking on bigger blockers...Has a motor for pursuit and downfield involvement, demonstrating the lateral movement and change-of-direction agility to flow from sideline to sideline...Leads by example and can handle hard coaching...Instinctive player who finds a way to the ball, as he can get to the line with suddenness, taking on the inside run with his shoulder downhill...Might be a bit slow at times to see the play develop, but once he locates the ball, he closes with good urgency...Is much better reading hats and tracking the ball when aligned outside than when working through trash inside...Slips blockers on plays that flow away from him and recognizes and reacts quickly to runs to the outside...Works through traffic aggressively, flashing lateral quickness, along with the quickness to cover tight ends and receivers in the slot...Struggles to shed when blitzing inside, but has the burst coming off the edge to generate backside pursuit...Can get covered up by the bigger blockers when playing inside, but shows good intent playing off blocks to make plays in space...Has improved his recovery ability, whereas he used to overrun and lose leverage on outside plays...Takes good angles and is quick to close when he gets a clean lane to the ball...Runs to the ball well and plays with good effort...Not a strong face-up tackler, but has had success taking a side in his chase...Has the body control to fit in space...Demonstrates the burst to close and times leaps well to break up passes...Has the flexible hips and quick feet to mirror a receiver's breaks...Has loose hips to flip with speed to get deep and cover the middle of the field...Possess the natural hands to make plays in front of him and shows good ball skills to make the interception...Has the speed to mirror receivers on deep routes and shows the feet to stay tight with the opponent working underneath...Focuses on the quarterback's eyes during his pass drop, using his quickness to get proper depth...Has a feel for his area in pass coverage, with the range to cover the field, as he shows alertness in zone coverage, reacting quickly to throws...Uses his quickness and speed to squeeze the edge on blitzes...Has the speed to chase and close on the move...Solid on the punt unit and uses his speed to be a solid contributor on the coverage squads.\r"

                "Overview": "An invaluable performer for the Hokies throughout his career, Xavier Adibi joined Vince Hall in forming one of the best linebacker tandems in college football. The duo would go on to record 695 tackles, 20 1/2 quarterback sacks, 60 stops behind the line of scrimmage and 52 pressures during their time together at Tech.\r\nWith his excellent range and quickness, Adibi will probably shift to outside linebacker in the NFL. Alert when playing zone coverage, Adibi gets excellent depth on his pass drops, and a team could choose to convert him to strong safety.\r\nAt Phoebus High School, Adibi was named an All-American by Prep Star as a defensive lineman and an All-American by Super Prep as a linebacker. The 2002 AAA first-team All-State selection by the Associated Press as a defensive lineman, he also earned first-team and Defensive Player of the Year honors on the 2002 AAA coaches All-State team. He received VHSCA All-Eastern Region and Newport News Daily Press All-Star Team honors as a defensive lineman as a senior. He was also a three-time Daily Press All-Star.\r\nAdibi was rated the 12th-best player in the Mid-Atlantic region and the top prospect in the state of Virginia by Tom Lemming's Prep Football Report. He was ranked the best player in Virginia by The Roanoke Times and rated the fourth-best linebacker in the nation and the premier player in Virginia by Super Prep. He added first-team All-Region accolades, along with picking up first-team AAA Coaches and Associated Press All-State recognition at defensive end as a junior.\r\nAdibi helped his team to back-to-back Group AAA championships, leading a Phantoms' defense that held opponents to fewer than five points a game. He finished with a team-best 13 1/2 sacks and 100-plus tackles, including 31 for loss as a senior, as he also rushed for 575 yards and 11 touchdowns at fullback.\r\nAdibi enrolled at Virginia Tech in 2003, spending the season on the scout team and was a member of the traveling squad, as his brother, Nathaniel, starred as a defensive end for the Hokies. Xavier Adibi got on the field for seven games as a reserve inside linebacker in 2004, missing six contests after he underwent surgery to repair a torn right biceps muscle, an injury suffered in the season opener vs. Southern California.\r\nHe would finish the season by posting 25 tackles (21 solo), two sacks and 4 1/2 stops for losses. He also caused a fumble and intercepted a pass. In 2005, Adibi took over right inside linebacker chores. He finished fourth on the squad with 69 tackles (28 solo) in 13 games, also coming up with three sacks and seven stops behind the line of scrimmage. He deflected four passes and picked off two others, returning one 25 yards for a touchdown.\r\nAs a junior, Adibi received All-Atlantic Coast Conference second-team honors. He ranked second on the squad with 82 tackles (29 solo) in 13 contests at right inside line-backer. He delivered three sacks with 6 1/2 stops for losses, five pressures and three forced fumbles. He recovered a fumble for a touchdown, gained 49 yards on three interception returns and broke up three passes.\r\nWith Vince Hall injured for part of the season, Adibi handled the leadership role on the nation's fourth-ranked defensive unit. He led the team with a career-high 115 tackles (55 solo), adding three sacks and a team-high 12 stops for losses. He also caused a fumble, deflected five passes and intercepted two others, returning one for a touchdown. That performance earned him All-American and All-Atlantic Coast Conference first-team honors.\r\nAsked about his breakout 2007 season, Adibi responded, \"Plays are happening very slowly for me. I can read much, much quicker before the snap. My run-pass read is much quicker than it's ever been. I am just getting off the ball and getting into my pass drops and getting to the line and getting into my gaps faster. I am feeling real free right now.\" \r\n\"He's got great speed,\" said Virginia Tech defensive coordinator Bud Foster. \"That's the first asset. He's physical. He's got the ability to be a complete linebacker. That means they don't have to take him out after first or second down. Besides his ability, he has a good football IQ. I think they will like that. He knows how it works and will be a good team guy.\""

                "Overview": "Blessed with incredible speed, Donnie Avery is difficult for cornerbacks to catch once he reaches a clearing. \r\nAvery, clocked at 4.2 seconds in the 40-yard dash, put his quickness to good use during a breakout performance in 2007. He led Conference USA and ranked fourth in the nation with an average of 112 receiving yards per game, while his averaged of seven catches per contest also led the league and ranked 14th nationally.\r\nIn addition, he shattered school and conference records during his final campaign with 346 yards receiving in the Rice contest, becoming the first player in C-USA annals to gain over 300 yards receiving in a game. His 427 all-purpose yards in that game also set new league and Houston records, topping his own record set two weeks earlier with 350 yards vs. East Carolina.\r\nAt Hastings High School, Avery was a unanimous first-team All-District selection as both a wide receiver and return specialist during his final season. He helped lead the team to the district championship and an 11-3 record, hauling in 36 passes for 502 yards and two touchdowns to lead the District 19-5A receivers in 2002. He also returned 13 punts for 399 yards and three scores, as well as seven kickoffs for 345 yards and one touchdown, in addition to rushing 16 times for 175 yards and two scores.\r\nAvery turned down scholarship offers from Kansas State, Tennessee, Texas Christian, New Mexico and Kansas when he decided to enroll at Houston in 2003. He competed on the scout team that year, moving into the starting lineup for all 11 games in 2004. \r\nHe finished fourth on the team with 18 receptions for 293 yards (16.3-yard average) and two scores, adding 343 yards on 18 kickoff returns (19.1 avg). He also returned three punts for 28 yards (9.3 avg) and registered seven tackles (four solo) with a stop for a two-yard loss. For his efforts, he was selected to the Freshman All-Conference USA squad.\r\nAs a sophomore, Avery started eight of 12 contests. He ranked third on the team with 44 receptions and second with 688 yards (15.6-yard average), including five touchdowns. He also produced five solo tackles. Eight of his catches were for 20 yards or longer.\r\nIn 2006, Avery appeared in 14 contests, earning 12 starts. He ranked second on the Cougars with 57 catches for 852 yards (14.9-yard average) and five touchdowns, as 12 of those grabs were for gains of at least 20 yards. He totaled 113 yards on six kickoff returns (18.8 avg) and amassed 965 all-purpose yards.\r\nAvery earned All-American second-team honors as an all-purpose back from The NFL Draft Report. He was a consensus All-Conference USA first-team choice as a receiver and second-team pick on special teams. He paced the Cougars with a career-high 91 catches for 1,456 yards (16.0 avg) and seven touchdowns. Seventeen of his catches were for at least 20 yards, as he also returned 15 kickoffs for 424 yards (28.3 avg) and a score. He recorded two solo tackles and generated 1,880 all-purpose yards.\r\nAvery started 42 of 50 games at Houston. He became the third player in school history to gain over 3,000 yards receiving, as he caught 210 passes for 3,289 yards (15.7-yard average) and 19 touchdowns. He had 41 catches for 20 yards or longer and returned 40 kickoffs for 896 yards (22.4-yard average), including one score. He added 28 yards on three punt returns (9.3 avg) and recorded 14 tackles (11 solo) with a stop for a two-yard loss. He amassed 4,213 all-purpose yards, an average of 84.26 yards per game."

                    "Compares To": "JEFF BACKUS-Detroit...Baker is a strong, physical straight-line blocker who is best when working in-line. He struggles with second-level defenders because he lacks ideal lateral range, but is a good mauler who sustains blocks and widens the running lane. He has enough initial quickness off the snap to gain advantage and plays flat-footed, demonstrating the hand punch to shock and jolt his man. He needs to be quicker with his hands, as he is too inconsistent with cross-face counter moves and, when he gets too tall in his stance and narrow in his base, the defender has some success in pulling him off balance. Finishing his blocks is an area in which he could improve, but Baker is a good mauler with the hand strength to dominate in one-on-one situations.",
                    "Negatives": "Can lock on and control his man at the line of scrimmage and runs with a normal stride, but will struggle to adjust to movement working into the second level...Not used much on traps and pulls, as he takes poor angles in attempts to neutralize linebackers...Needs to keep his feet when working in space, as he will overextend at times in attempts to engage a moving target...Balance is much better working in-line, as he gets his base too narrow when having to move long distances...Has a strong hand punch, but his hands are not quick, causing him to have problems adjusting instantly to counter moves (especially cross-face action)...Will sometimes get his hands outside his frame, resulting in wild whiffs in attempts to sustain...Crosses his feet at times when trying to retreat in pass protection and is susceptible to speed moves off the edge...Just an adequate student, but does show good coverage recognition skills on the field...For a player with his impressive strength, he needs to generate a strong hand jolt with better consistency...Plays with good effort, but needs to stay on blocks longer...Relies more on power than technique, lacking the true explosion you would want from someone his size coming off the snap...Needs to improve his footwork a bit, as he seems hesitant redirecting to inside moves...Will punch and jab at defenders rather than trying to push off.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a tall frame with solid overall muscle development, good arm length, wide hips and thighs, good lower-body thickness -- especially in the thighs and calves -- big, strong hands and room on his frame to add at least another 20 pounds of bulk without a negative impact...Has good quickness off the snap, running with a normal stride and builds his acceleration nicely...Has the initial step to gain advantage off the ball and will generally play on his feet when stationary, showing good balance to slide and re-adjust in pass protection...Knows how to sink his weight and drop his pads to generate a strong anchor...Hits the defenders instantly coming off the ball, delivering power behind his arm swipes...Gains position and sustains blocks when he plays with a wide base and arms extended...Has the leg drive to steer and pin the defender, but needs to be more consistent with his knee-bend...Can gain position working in-line when he keeps his pad level down and shows decent explosion when generating cut blocks...Plays a bit bent at the waist, but has the upper-body strength to jolt and control his man...Once he gets his hands on an opponent, the battle is over...Uses hands properly to turn the defender, as he is very quick to set and extend, delivering a forceful jab and punch on the pass rusher...Better gaining position on in-line blocks than on the move, as he aggressively works to control and widen rush lanes...Has enough agility to make the reach block, doing a solid job of walling off on screens...Alert to stunts and the blitz, working hard to maintain a low base, using his long arms to extend and lock into the defender...Competes and works hard in the weight room and shows good communication skills to work well with the offensive guard in picking up stunts with ease...Shuffles his feet well setting up in pass protection but lacks sustained quickness...Can quickly redirect a defender when he gets his hands on him, as he throws those hands with very good timing to press and keep the defensive end at bay...Compensates for a lack of ideal lateral movement by playing flat-footed when trying to recover in his kick-slide...While he might struggle with fast movement in the second level, he does a good job of blocking when his man is directly in front of him.\r"

                "Overview": "The Trojans' front wall anchor at the demanding left offensive tackle position, Baker has battled injury problems the last two years. When healthy, he dominated in the trenches and was pretty good while playing through pain. \r\nEven though he missed three full games and a good portion of two others in 2007, he became only the third three-time All-American first-team selection in school history. The first to accomplish that feat was linebacker Richard Wood (1972-74), followed by quarterback Matt Leinart (2003-05).\r\nBaker comes from a family with strong sports tradition. His uncle, Ben Baker, was an offensive lineman at Duke, playing tackle for the Blue Devils from 1969-71. His father, David, is the commissioner of the Arena Football League and formerly played basketball at UC Irvine and then professionally in Europe. \r\nAt Tustin High School, Baker earned Super Prep, Prep Star, Student Sports and Tom Lemming Prep Football Report All-American first-team honors, adding second-team accolades from USA Today. He was also chosen to the Prep Star Top 100 Dream Team, The Sporting News Hot 100, Tom Lemming Top 100, Super Prep All-Farwest, Prep Star All-West, Tom Lemming All-West and Long Beach Press-Telegram Best in the West first-team squads.\r\nIn addition, he garnered Tacoma News Tribune Western 100, Orange County Register Fab 15, Cal-Hi Sports All-State, All-CIF Southern Section, All-CIF Division VI, Los Angeles Times All-Star and Orange County Register All-Orange County first-team recognition as a senior offensive and defensive lineman in 2002. That season, he recorded 34 tackles with 2 1/2 sacks on defense, helping Tustin advance to the CIF Division VI semi-finals.\r\nAs a junior, Baker collected Cal-Hi Sports All-State Underclass second-team, All-CIF Division VI, Los Angeles Times All-Orange County and All-League first-team honors. He also competed in the weight events for the school's track team.\r\nBaker enrolled at Southern California in 2003, spending the season performing as an offensive guard on the scout team. The following season, he shifted to left offensive tackle, starting 13 games. He was named to the Football Writers, The Sporting News, Collegefootballnews.com and Rivals.com Freshman All-American first-teams, adding All-Pac-10 Conference second-team while collecting 74 knockdown blocks. He was also named the team's Offensive Lineman of the Year, the first freshman to be honored as such as a Trojan.\r\nIn 2005, Baker continued to elevate his play. The CBS SportsLine.com All-American first- team choice added third-team recognition from the Associated Press and Rivals.com. He collected first-team All-Pac-10 Conference first-team accolades and was named the team's Co-Lifter of the Year. In 13 games, he delivered 103 knockdowns, including a dozen touchdown-resulting blocks, despite playing the final month of the regular season with a bone chip in his left knee.\r\nAs a junior, Baker shared team Lifter of the Year and Offensive Lineman of the Year honors. He was a first-team All-American pick by the Football Writers Association, The Sporting News, CBS SportsLine.com, Associated Press and the Walter Camp Football Foundation. He was again selected to the All-Pac-10 Conference first-team, helping the offense average 385.46 yards per game. He graded 85.85% for blocking consistency, posting 109 knockdowns, including 14 touchdown-resulting blocks.\r\nAfter having left knee surgery in January, Baker was slowed early in the season by a cracked rib that he suffered during a mid-August scrimmage prior to the 2007 season. He sat out games against Notre Dame, Oregon State and California and saw limited action vs. Oregon after he strained his hamstring vs. Arizona. He still garnered All-American first-team honors from the Walter Camp Foundation and was an All-Pac-10 first-team pick. He again shared USC Offensive Lineman of the Year Award honors, as he produced 88 knockdowns and 12 touchdown-resulting blocks."

                    "Compares To": "FRED ROBBINS-New York Giants...Like Robbins, it took several years before Balmer was able to become a steady contributor. For three seasons at North Carolina, Balmer showed marginal work ethic and there was too much inconsistency in his play. The new UNC coaching staff ignited a passion in his play, but you have to wonder if it is the start of good things to come or just a one-year wonder driven by the prospect of going to the NFL. He needs to develop better lower-body strength, as he struggles vs. double teams, but when he keeps his pads down, he is effective at shooting the gaps and generating pursuit in the backfield. He has a strong hand punch to shock and jolt blockers, evident by his solid play in containing the run in 2007.",
                    "Negatives": "Has to continue to develop his lower-body strength, as he was efficient vs. isolated blockers as a senior, but struggled to hold his ground vs. double teams...Had a solid senior campaign, but his lack of overall consistency and urgency in his play earlier in his career (looked lethargic late in games) makes one wonder if 2007 was his \"coming out party\" or a fluke...Has some versatility to get a few snaps at defensive end, but he lacks the ideal explosion and flow to the ball to come off the edge and generate long pursuit (much better taking angles and penetrating in-line)...Has worked hard to keep his pads down, but when he is stood up at the line, he leaves his chest exposed and lacks the leg drive to slip off blocks when the offensive linemen generate movement...When blockers get into his chest, they can drive him off the ball and away from the rush lanes with good success...Much more conscious of keeping his hands within his frame as a senior, but when he swings wildly, he is incapable of playing off blocks...Best when shooting the gaps vs. a free lane, as he does not have the lower-body power to push the pocket consistently (lacks steady explosion when facing blockers and is somewhat slow trying to disengage vs. the double team, as he needs to anchor better to prevent from getting uprooted out of the holes vs. running plays directed right at him)...Must also work on refining his leverage vs. angle and down blocks...Concentration tends to drift and this can result in him being late coming off the snap...Consistency has been lacking from his game, but it is sometimes hidden by his raw talent...When he plays high off the snap in pass-rushing situations, blockers have good success locking on low to ride him out...Has good lateral agility, but will not use it all the time, as he tends to not pursue the ball for distance...Gives up the battle early with the blocker if his initial move does not work...Has developed better work habits, but must be monitored, as he needs to be prodded to do the little extras in the training room and practices...Improved in these areas as a senior, but is still a work in progress.\r",

Hand punch has become one of his better assets, using it well to push and collapse the pocket...More efficient when he drops his weight and stays low in his stance, as he is much better in his attempts to redirect vs. in-line plays, showing enough acceleration and surge to close on the quarterback (nimble moving his feet when flashing from the backside)...Fires low off the snap and maintains balance well while stacking up the inside running game (good on stunts)...Has a much better understanding of blocking schemes as a senior and showed little hesitation diagnosing the plays to string the action wide...Times his jumps to disrupt the pocket...Has developed strong rip moves to penetrate, locate and flush out the quarterback...Generates a forceful bull rush when he drives with his legs and executes hand swipes to create a surge off the snap...His change-of-direction agility has improved to the point that he can come back fast from the low blocks to jump up and make the tackle...Hits through the blocks, wraps and secures the ballcarrier when tackling, as he displays a good short-area closing burst and also has functional quickness for some long pursuit...When he anchors and plays flat-footed, he is effective at getting into position to make the tackle...Has adequate range and lateral quickness to close on the ball...Seems more comfortable when utilized in a slant stance, showing enough vertical quickness to make plays to his side.\r"

                "Overview": "Regarded as the premier defensive lineman in his area coming out of high school, Kentwan Balmer finally lived up to his vast potential as a senior with the Tar Heels. \r\nThe former defensive end was shifted to defensive tackle as a junior, but it was not until the arrival of coach Butch Davis that Balmer excelled on the football field. Davis took the talented youngster under his wing and Balmer surpassed his cumulative statistical production from his first three seasons during his final year.\r\nBalmer earned All-Area and All-Conference honors as a junior and senior at Weldon High School. The 2003 Area Defensive Player of the Year helped the team produce three shutouts in their first six games that year. He posted 113 tackles, 12 sacks, eight pass breakups and six fumble recoveries his final campaign. As a junior, he registered 103 tackles, 11 sacks and scored a defensive touchdown on a fumble recovery. He was also a member of the North Carolina Shrine Bowl Team.\r\nBalmer enrolled at North Carolina in 2004. The 250-pound right defensive end saw limited action in nine games, coming up with one assisted tackle. As a sophomore, he added more than 30 pounds to his frame and would appear in 11 games. He started the final three contests at right defensive end for an injured Tommy Davis, responding with 17 tackles (eight solo), a sack, five stops for losses and five quarterback pressures. He also deflected one pass.\r\nIn 2007, Balmer appeared in 10 games, starting the final eight contests at left defensive tackle. An early season right high ankle sprain forced him to miss the Virginia Tech and Furman clashes and he later re-injured his ankle in the second half vs. Wake Forest. He was in on 16 tackles (14 solo) with 2 1/2 sacks. He added one pressure, as he also blocked two extra point attempts and batted away a pair of passes.\r\nAs a senior, Balmer shifted to right defensive tackle. He earned second-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference accolades and received the team's James Southerland Award (captain), as he ranked second on the team with 59 tackles (33 solo). He collected 3 1/2 sacks, 9 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage and four pressures.\r\nIn 42 games at North Carolina, Balmer started 23 times. He collected 93 tackles (55 solo) with seven sacks for minus-52 yards, 17 stops for losses of 79 total yards and 10 quarterback pressures. He also deflected three passes and blocked a pair of kicks."

                "Overview": "After missing the second half of his junior campaign due to a left ankle sprain, the physical tackler had a banner final season for the Rebels, elevating his draft stock to among the elite at his position. Known for his aggressive nature on the football field, the weak-side linebacker is likely to shift to middle linebacker in the NFL to take advantage of his ability to neutralize the inside ground game.\r\nAt Tustin High School, Bell's versatility proved to be invaluable. He competed at safety, outside and inside linebacker, defensive end, tailback and fullback during his career, in addition to handling place-kicking and punting chores. He was a two-time All-Century League and Defensive Most Valuable Player, as he produced 150 tackles, five sacks and two interceptions as a senior for the Tillers. He also carried the ball 55 times for 506 yards and eight touchdowns for the 2003 league champs. He was selected to play in the prestigious Cal-Florida Game and registered five tackles.\r\nAs a true freshman at UNLV, Bell appeared in 11 games as a reserve weak-side outside linebacker, lining up in that unit alongside his older brother Zach (2001-04). Beau Bell posted 26 tackles (16 solo) and a stop for a loss. He also recovered and caused one fumble.\r\nAs a sophomore, Bell battled through a groin injury all year, but still earned second-team All-Mountain West Conference honors. He appeared in 11 games, starting the final seven at middle linebacker. He would go on to rank second on the squad with 92 tackles (50 solo), adding 3 1/2 sacks and 7 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He also batted away a pair of passes.\r\nA member of the 2006 Butkus Award Watch List and a preseason All-MWC first-team choice, Bell saw his junior season come to an end in the team's seventh game vs. Brigham Young, when he suffered a left ankle sprain. He still managed to finish second on the squad with 76 tackles (41 solo), delivering four sacks and nine stops for losses. He was leading the MWC in tackles at the time of his injury.\r\nIn '07, Bell earned All-Mountain West Conference first-team honors and was named Defensive Player of the Year. He was the first player in MWC annals to earn Defensive Player of the Week honors three times in the same season. He was also the recipient of the Rebels' team MVP and Captain Award honors. In addition, he received the Bill \"Wildcat\" Morris Most Inspirational Award and the \"Doc\" Tobler Senior Award, which is given to the final-year player who brings the highest credit to himself and the university. Still, because of a lack of recognition, the only All-American honor he received came from The NFL Draft Report.\r\nBell's MWC Defensive Player of the Year Award marked the fourth time a Rebel earned the conference honor, joining two-time winner Jamaal Brimmer (2002, '03 -- media only), Kevin Thomas (2001) and Aaron Moog (1984). Bell is also the first UNLV linebacker to earn such an honor. \r\n\"It's a big deal being named the player of the year for this conference because the coaches vote along with the media,\" said Bell. \"We worked hard all year as a team and this is a great way to wrap up my college career. Despite our final record I had a lot of fun playing with these guys and will never forget my senior year as a Rebel.\" \r\nBell started all 12 games at weak-side linebacker, leading the team and league with a career-high 126 tackles (79 solo), with three sacks and 9 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He led the conference and tied for fourth in the nation with five forced fumbles and deflected three passes while intercepting four others, returning one for a touchdown.\r\n\"Beau Bell made a decision in the spring and summer to be a great player and he went out and made that a reality in the fall,\" said UNLV head coach Mike Sanford. \"He gave us both great performance and leadership and will leave that legacy for the future of this program.\"\r\nIn 41 games at Nevada-Las Vegas, Bell started 26 times (seven at middle linebacker, 19 at weak-side 'backer). He finished second in school history with 320 tackles (186 solo), as he made 10 1/2 sacks for minus-62 yards and 27 stops for losses of 102 total yards. He caused six fumbles and had one fumble recovery while deflecting five passes. He also had four interceptions for 13 yards in returns, including one touchdown."

                    "Compares To": "ALEX SMITH-San Francisco...Smith is several inches taller and more powerful than Brennan, but both rely on their athletic agility to step up and avoid pressure. Brennan has that moxie on the field that reminds some of Brett Favre, but it is his quick reads that sees him get the ball out instantly to his targets. He is a mobile passer whose scrambling keeps defenses honest, but lacks the size and certainly lacks the core strength you look for in a quarterback that can absorb punishment at the next level. In a spread or West Coast offense, Brennan is a nice fit. But despite good arm strength in the short-to-intermediate areas, he isn't capable of consistently attacking the deep secondary.",
                    "Negatives": "Has good quickness and a strong throwing arm, but his overall core strength is marginal and he might struggle absorbing punishment at the next level...Field smart, but needs to make a better effort academically...Puts in the effort in the training room, but has marginal lifting habits...Does not have the size, strength or body mass you look for at his position...Can fire the ball with good strength, but when he throws off the wrong foot, his deep throws tend to wobble...Puts a lot of effort behind his deep throws, but his footwork needs to be refined...Will lose his composure under a fierce pass rush, but will generally step up and avoid...Will generally throw with a high release, but when he fires low, he gets lots of passes deflected (see 2007 Louisiana Tech game)...Has good arm strength, but must throw with better velocity when attacking the seam...Now scans the field well, but did lock on to his primary target too often in the early stages of his career...Will throw the ball with a three-quarters sidearm delivery when rolling out, but needs to refine that delivery (better when going over the top), as he will drop his arm too low at times and this affects his trajectory, resulting in deflected passes...Not the type that will force the ball into traffic when pressured, but possibly due to his ankle injury negating his foot speed in 2007, he struggled to maintain balance on roll-outs, resulting in a high amount of his passes being intercepted or deflected.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a tall, lanky frame, with good upper-body structure, tapered thighs and room to carry additional bulk -- at least 20 pounds -- with no loss in quickness...Runs with a normal stride, showing the valid speed and balance to force defenses to account for him when running with the ball...Very mobile in the pocket, which causes problems for a slower defense to cover him on roll-outs...Slides and adjusts to pocket pressure with ease, showing the body control to easily throw on the move...Has good acceleration driving back from center to his throwing point...Has the nimble feet to throw on the move and the arm strength to stretch the defenses when passing from the outside hashes...Shows ease of movement sliding in the pocket and while he lacks blazing speed, he is a threat to gain valid yardage running with the ball...Does a good job of taking plays from the chalkboard to the field and excels at adjusting to defensive coverage, making good pre-snap decisions...Plays with good intensity and won't get rattled under pressure...Quick decision-maker who has the confidence in his arm to make all the plays...Demonstrates good body control running with the ball, but needs to work on ball security (seven fumbles in 2006, nine in 2007)...Fires the ball out quickly and has the vision and patience to scan the field and wait for secondary targets to open...Even though he is used more in the shotgun, he has the good quickness to set and throw coming back from the center...Throws on the move as well as he throws from the pocket due to his fine balance and body control...Has a compact throwing motion and knows how to vary his release and delivery, carrying the ball at chest height and throwing over the top when in the pocket, or with a three-quarters sidearm delivery when passing on the move...Even with that release, his passes are high enough to not get batted down at the line of scrimmage...Has the arm strength to air the ball out, showing very good timing and ball speed...Plays with good awareness and always seems to know where his receivers are, doing a nice job of checking down and making progression reads...Has better timing and accuracy working the short-to-intermediate areas...Gets good trajectory on his deep throws, but must step into them better...Has very good anticipation skills and delivers a catchable ball that gets to his target without the receiver having to adjust (throws the ball to get it there when the receiver is about to come out of his break)...Does a fine job of stepping up or sliding when flushed out of the pocket (struggled with an ankle injury most of the 2007 season)...Knows when to throw, as he has the knack for anticipating when his receivers will be coming out of their cuts...Does a solid job of locating secondary targets and checking down, demonstrating very good vision on route-progression reads...Knows how to adjust his delivery when throwing on the move...Respected leader with good huddle presence...Has a good command of the offensive game plan and his teammates respect his ability to create and improvise with the ball in his hands...Has a feel for pocket pressure, knowing when to slide or step up to find the throwing lanes, as it is rare to see him step back or fall away from his tosses...Has the scrambling ability to throw on the run with good short-to-intermediate area accuracy, showing the nimble feet to buy time and the natural instincts to know when to run with the ball.\r"

                "Overview": "One of the most accurate passers in the history of college football, Brennan is the owner of 21 NCAA records in just over two seasons in a Warriors' uniform. \r\nA model of consistency, he established many Bowl Subdivision records, including 34 consecutive games with at least 200 passing yards and 20 games with at least 400 yards in total offense. His average of 387.89 yards per game in total offense and a pass completion percentage of .712 are among myriad notable national marks he set among the 31 NCAA records that he established in just 38 games at Hawaii.\r\nOn the way to shattering numerous national Western Athletic Conference and school passing and total offense records, he has drawn the praise of opposing head coaches. \r\n\"Colt is as mobile and accurate quarterback that I've seen in a while,\" Boise State head coach Chris Peterson stated. \"He has a great feel for the game and to stop Hawaii, you have to stop Colt.\" \r\nAt Mater Dei High School, Brennan earned three letters in football and one in basketball. The team's MVP in 2001, he added All-League first-team gridiron honors. He led the squad to a 9-5 record his final year, completing more than 68% of his passes with 16 touchdowns and four interceptions, adding 200 yards and four scores on the ground.\r\nThe team went 11-2 his junior year and 9-1 during his sophomore campaign, when he led the team to the CIF championship with a win over powerhouse DeLaSalle High. After his senior year, he was invited to play in the County All-Star Game. He also lettered as a forward on the basketball team as a senior and the squad captured the CIF title.\r\nBrennan turned down a scholarship offer from Utah State to enroll at Worcester Academy (Mass.) in 2002. He started seven games that season, completing 101-of-158 passes for 1,707 yards, 15 touchdowns and only four interceptions, but missed two games with a finger fracture. The All-New England Prep School choice helped the team to a 5-4 record, throwing for 287 yards and three scores on 16-of-22 attempts in an upset victory over Mount Ida and gained 390 yards with four scores in a triumph over Valley Forge.\r\nBrennan enrolled at the University of Colorado in 2003 as a walk-on. He was listed fourth on the depth chart, but never appeared in a game at the school. His college career almost ended before it began when, on Jan. 28, 2004, he was arrested by campus police and charged with entering a co-ed's room. Uninvited, he was intoxicated at the time of the incident and the woman claimed he exposed himself and fondled her. He pleaded guilty to burglary and trespassing, but a charge of unlawful sexual contact was vacated by the court for lack of evidence. He was dismissed from the team.\r\nBrennan transferred to Saddleback Community College, where he appeared in nine games during the 2004 season. He ranked third in the California junior college ranks with an average of 19.7 pass completions per game, seventh with an average of 253.7 yards passing and seventh in total offense (287.7 yards per game). He completed 177-of-259 passes (68.3%) for 2,532 yards, 23 touchdowns and four interceptions. He also rushed for 57 yards on 66 tries (0.9-yard average) with a score, finishing with 2,589 total yards.\r\nWhen coach June Jones recruited him to Hawaii, Brennan found someone with complete confidence in his passing skills. Jones slowly brought Brennan along in the early stage of the 2005 season before turning the starting reins over for 10 games. Brennan led an offensive attack that ranked second in the nation in passing (384.25 yards per game) and led the 1-A ranks in total offense (476.17 yards per game).\r\nHe ranked ninth nationally with a 155.49 pass-efficiency rating, leading the country with an average of 371.25 yards in total offense, 358.42 aerial yards and 19.17 points responsible for per game. His 4,301 yards was the best in the nation, as he completed 350-of-515 pass attempts (68.0%), with 35 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. He finished second on the team with 154 yards and two scores on 99 carries (1.6-yard average) and totaled 4,455 yards on 614 offensive plays.\r\nTo most quarterbacks, Brennan's 2005 stats would represent an entire college career. But the 2006 season was even more impressive, and Brennan did it in record-shattering fashion. The Sammy Baugh Award winner and Davey O'Brien Award finalist finished second in the voting for Cingular National Player of the Year Award honors. He earned All-American first-team recognition from The NFL Draft Report, adding second-team accolades from Walter Camp. He was named Western Athletic Conference Offensive Player of the Year and finished sixth in the voting for the Heisman Trophy.\r\nBrennan would go on to set 18 NCAA, 17 WAC and 41 school records. He led the nation in pass efficiency (185.96), total offense (422.5 yards per game), points responsible for (27.71 ppg), yards passing (5,549), completion percentage (72.6) and yards passing per game (396.36). He hit on 406-of-559 tosses for 5,549 yards, including a national-record 58 touchdowns and only 12 interceptions. He finished second on the squad with 366 yards and five scores on 86 carries (4.3-yard average). He participated in 645 plays, gaining 5,915 total yards.\r\nBrennan continued to torch opposing defensive backs in 2007, but he suffered a right ankle sprain in the team's third game vs. Nevada-Las Vegas that forced him to leave in the third quarter. Brennan re-injured the ankle the following week vs. Idaho and was forced to sit out the Charleston Southern game. He came back vs. Utah State, but his ankle didn't cooperate, forcing Brennan out just prior to halftime. \r\nA concussion on a head-on collision vs. Fresno State would sideline him for the final 10 minutes vs. the Bulldogs and the following week, he saw just limited action vs. Nevada. In the Sugar Bowl vs. Georgia, he was shaken up in the fourth quarter and replaced for the final 14 minutes of Hawaii's only loss for the year.\r\nBrennan managed to rank fifth in the nation in passing efficiency (159.85), fourth in points responsible for (23 per game) and passing yards (4,343), third in total offense (364.17 yards per game) and pass completions per game (29.92 per game) and second in average yards passing per game (361.92 ypg). The Hawaii quarterback connected on 359-of-510 passes (70.4%) for 4,343 yards, 38 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. He scored eight times on 82 carries, recorded a solo tackle and amassed 4,370 yards in total offense.\r\nIn 38 games at Hawaii, Brennan started 35 times. He completed 1,292-of-1,584 passes (70.39%) for 14,193 yards, 131 touchdowns and 42 interceptions. He rushed 267 times for 547 yards (2.1-yard average) and 15 scores. On 1,851 offensive plays, he totaled 14,740 yards and 146 total touchdowns.\r\nIncluding nine games at Saddleback College, Brennan participated in 47 collegiate games. He piled up 16,725 yards with 154 touchdowns and 46 interceptions on 1,292-of-1,843 throws (70.1%). He gained 604 yards with 16 scores on 333 carries (1.8-yard average). He totaled 17,329 yards on 2,176 offensive plays, an average of 368.7 yards per game."

He has the size that the football gods would wish for all safeties, yet needs to be prodded to play up to that level at a consistent pace. He has a litany of injuries throughout his career that makes you wonder if Alan Alda and the M*A*S*H unit is going to be needed on the sideline. It is humorous that some experts compare him to Washington's LaRon Landry. While impressive athletically, he lacks the power, football intelligence, consistency and ability to change the tide of the game the way Landry does.",
                    "Negatives": "Has an even proportioned, big frame, but is at maximum growth potential and any more weight will impact his impressive timed speed...Despite his timed speed, he has just adequate foot quickness and body control in his backpedal...Lacks suddenness closing on plays in front of him and is a little tight in his hips, as he is not able to suddenly plant and drive out of his breaks (gathers some)...Has good leaping ability, but like former ASU standout Adam Archuletta, he has poor timing on those jumps, failing to make proper adjustments to get under the ball or reach it at its high point...Has the frame of a linebacker, but it is rare to see him generate a lot of power behind his hits...Has impressive workout numbers, but they fail to translate to the football field (averaged just 3.7 tackles per game during his career)...Can close on the ball in front of him, but needs to drive harder with his legs and extend his arms to properly wrap and secure the ballcarrier (will dive at runners or take a side rather than square up)...Does not have the recovery burst to get back on the route when the receiver gets behind him...Not an instinctive player, making poor reads (or late) at times and is prone to biting on play-action...Must develop looser hips, as he struggles when redirecting and changing direction...Allows too much of a cushion vs. short-area receivers, who just settle into soft spots in front of him...Plays too flat-footed and is too rigid in his turns to come out of his cuts with a sudden burst... Has a litany of injury problems that lead to durability issues...For a player of his size, he tends to try to out-finesse blockers rather than attack them with aggression...Must show better consistency, as he will disappear for long stretches on the field and simply throttles down when not involved in the action (this, more so than injuries, led to a three-game benching in 2007).\r",

Anticipates the receiver's moves well when trailing and it is rare to see him under-play the ball when in zone coverage...Has good body adjustment skills to get under the thrown ball, but needs to time his leaps better to high point it...Has the range and speed to chase down plays going long distances (will struggle turning out of his breaks, but can stay on the hip of a receiver when mirroring)...Hands are suspect in attempts to make the interception, but he uses them well in attempts to reroute short-area receivers or shed blocks vs. tight ends...Plays under control and takes good angles to shorten the field and reduce the ball carrier's cut back lanes...Needs to get more physical with bigger blockers (likes to avoid), but does have the quickness to take a wide loop and pressure the pocket on the blitz...Not the type who will use his hidden strength to physically punish an opponent, but does generate enough force to bring the ball carrier down in isolated situations...Smart and instinctive enough to make the defensive calls...Has a knack for getting his hands into a receiver's jersey to reroute his opponent without getting caught...Also uses those hands well to ward off low blocks when working down the line...Has the hand strength to lock on and drag down the receiver (opponent will slip past when he gives a side, though)...Effective gunner on special teams...When playing in the box, he demonstrates the pursuit angles and range to string plays wide.\r"

                "Overview": "Regarded by the ASU staff as one of the finest safeties to ever play at the university, Barrett was plagued with an assortment of injuries throughout his senior campaign, missing the final two contests with a knee sprain. Built more along the lines of an outside linebacker, his exceptional range and quickness has NFL teams that feature the Cover-2 scheme hoping to see him line him up in their secondary in 2008.\r\nOne of eight active Sun Devils to have earned his undergraduate degree prior to his senior season, Barrett has also received Pac-10 Conference academic honors. It is fitting that he hopes to one day become a dentist, as he spent his last four years drilling any receiver that dared to come into his area. With his 4.35 clocking in the 40-yard dash, he is the Sun Devils' fastest player to ever wear a defensive uniform.\r\nBarrett attended Reno High School, where he was selected the Northern Class 4A Football Player of the Year in Nevada in 2002. He was a member of the Las Vegas Sun All-State team on offense and as a returner. He garnered first-team All-Region honors at wide receiver, defensive back and return specialist as a senior, as he also earned Sierra League first-team honors and was the Conference Player of the Year.\r\nA first-team All-Sierra League selection at defensive back, receiver and as a returner, Barrett also made All-League as a running back. He rushed for 490 yards on 60 carries and scored five touchdowns. He also caught 22 passes for 365 yards and five more scores while making five interceptions in his final year. He returned seven kicks and punts for touchdowns and scored four times on interception returns during his career.\r\nAs a junior, Barrett was named to the All-Nevada Class 4A and All-Northern Region second-team as a returner, adding All-Sierra League first-team honors. He also played basketball as a junior and senior and lettered three times in track, in addition to playing baseball as a sophomore. He captained the football and basketball teams as a senior and graduated with a 3.4 grade-point average.\r\nBarrett made his debut at Arizona State in the season opener vs. Northern Arizona in 2003, but suffered a right shoulder injury that would sideline him for the rest of the schedule. The shoulder injury limited him to 10 games (four starts) in 2004. He managed 17 tackles (12 solos) with two fumble recoveries and an interception.\r\nThe sophomore strong safety started two of 12 games for the Sun Devils in 2005. He posted 37 tackles (26 solos) with a sack, three stops for losses and four pass break-ups. He also had one interception. Adding more than 10 pounds of muscle to his frame, he took over strong safety chores in 2006. He was named the team's Defensive MVP, adding Academic All-Pac 10 Conference honors while collecting a team-high 82 tackles (58 solos). He had 7.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage, three interceptions and six deflected passes to go along with a fumble recovery.\r\nBarrett started eight of 11 games he appeared in during 2007, as he was benched for three games earlier in the campaign due to his injury issues, including a pectoral muscle strain, a quad contusion and a right knee sprain. He managed just 38 tackles (25 solos), along with a sack and four stops for losses. He recovered a fumble, broke up seven passes and intercepted another."

He has just adequate run-after-the-catch agility and is not the type that will be an effective deep threat due to just marginal explosion and a lack of a second gear. He is not a capable blocker, compared to recent Notre Dame tight ends and must improve his overall strength, as more often than not, he is bowled over when trying to block vs. the bull rush. He has had a few knee issues in the past, but was relatively healthy as a senior.

Does not have the shake to escape from the defender in the open field...Needs to get his head around better and show better arm extension to look the ball in over his outside shoulder...Allows too much penetration when trying to block in-line and needs to use his hands when trying to seal and sustain blocks.\r",

                "Overview": "Carlson developed into one of the elite tight ends in the country at Notre Dame, even though few people even knew of him when he arrived at the university as the \"other tight end\" in the 2003 recruiting class that featured Chicago Bears' 2007 first-round pick Greg Olsen. Olsen later transferred to Miami (Fla.), leaving Carlson to spend two years battling for playing time behind Anthony Fasano. \r\nWhen Fasano opted to leave school early to join the Dallas Cowboys, Carlson finally got his chance to be a full-time starter. Over his last two seasons, he would grab 87 of his career 100 receptions, totaling 1,006 of the 1,093 yards he gained during his time with the Fighting Irish. He also found the end zone seven times during that span, as he scored eight career touchdowns.\r\nAt Litchfield High School, Carlson was ranked 19th on the Detroit Free-Press 20-player Best of the Midwest team and was also named to the 10-member Super Preps team by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. The four-year starter at tight end was a two-time All-State and three-time All-Conference selection, playing in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl after his senior season.\r\nCarlson caught 41 passes for 471 yards and seven touchdowns as a senior in 2002, and made 79 tackles and two sacks at defensive end that year. For his career, he snared 95 passes for 1,331 yards and 23 touchdowns, adding 133 rushing attempts for 493 yards and seven scores, while also returning kicks. He scored 194 points and recorded 200 career tackles, including 96 solos.\r\nIn basketball, Carlson was a McDonald's preseason All-American as a senior and earned All-Conference and All-Area honors four straight seasons. He was the conference MVP as a junior and senior and played in the Minnesota Basketball Coaches Association All-Star game. The starting center helped the team compile a 114-8 record during his career while winning the Minnesota Class 2A state title three times. He finished his prep career with 1,676 points, 974 rebounds and 412 assists.\r\nCarlson also lettered in tennis, helping his team reach the state finals as a junior. He had a career record of 106-22 playing No. 1 doubles. The three-time All-Conference selection was a two-time participant in the individual state tennis tournament, earning four letters in the sport.\r\nIn 2003, Carlson spent his first season performing on the scout team at Notre Dame. He also appeared briefly in three games with the 2003-04 Irish basketball team, scoring two points on a pair of free throws and grabbing one defensive rebound. He was part of the rotation at tight end in 2004, starting two of 12 games, but saw most of his action on special teams. He recorded five tackles (four solo) on the coverage unit and made six catches for 31 yards (5.2-yard average).\r\nCarlson was limited in 2005 preseason drills with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee, but went on to start six of 12 games with Notre Dame utilizing a double-tight end formation. He managed to grab seven passes for 56 yards (8.0-yard average) and a score. On 263 special teams appearances, he registered 13 tackles (nine solo) and returned a kickoff 14 yards.\r\nWhen Fasano turned pro, Carlson started 11 games during the 2006 season. He sat out the Army and Southern California contests after he suffered a right knee medial collateral ligament sprain vs. Air Force, but was still named a finalist for the John Mackey Award. The Sports Illustrated second-team All-American and ESPN Academic All-American pick snared a career-high 47 passes for 634 yards (13.5-yard average) and four touchdowns. He also registered four tackles (three solo) while participating with the special teams coverage units.\r\nCarlson's senior year did not turn out as expected. Rated the best tight end in college, he was one of the few bright spots for a team that finished the season with a 3-9 record. He caught a pass in all 12 games, extending his consecutive reception string to 23 contests, as he led the Irish with 40 catches for 372 yards (9.3-yard average) and three touchdowns. He also recorded six tackles (four solo).\r\nThe coaching staff noticed during his senior year that Carlson was taking well to his captaincy role. \"He's become much more vocal,\" head coach Charlie Weis said. \"He's a quiet kid by nature. He still has the fire when he drops a pass in practice. But he's (filled) a vocal leadership void. All he wants to do is to do anything he can to give us the best chance of winning.\" \r\nSelected to play in the 2008 Senior Bowl, Carlson was forced to miss the game after a mysterious flu-like virus sapped him of energy and almost 10 pounds during the week prior to the practices. \r\nCarlson played in 47 games at Notre Dame, starting 31 contests. He finished his career with 100 receptions for 1,093 yards (10.9-yard average) and eight touchdowns. On special teams, he registered 28 tackles (20 solo) and returned one kickoff for 14 yards."

He is a liability as a receiver due to marginal hands, poor extension and limited experience or a good feel for running routes. Still, he manages to get good yardage up the middle, but his deficiencies are glaring enough to keep him out of the draft's first day.",

                "Overview": "Tashard Choice proved to be the unquestioned leader of the Georgia Tech offense and one of the toughest players in college football. \r\nWell on his way to another banner campaign in 2007, he suffered a right knee injury on Oct. 20 vs. Army and underwent surgery three days later. After sitting out the Virginia Tech game, Choice was back on the field, recording a trio of 100-yard performances over his final four contests.\r\nChoice led the Atlantic Coast Conference in rushing in 2006 and '07 seasons, becoming the first player to accomplish that feat since Thomas Jones of Virginia (1998-99). He also became the first Tech player to produce back-to-back 1,000-yard rushing campaigns, totaling 1,473 yards as a junior and 1,379 yards in his final season.\r\nThe talented running back finished his career as the school's record-holder with 18 100-yard rushing performances. He ranks third in Tech annals with 28 touchdowns on the ground and fourth with 3,465 yards rushing. His 3,646 all-purpose yards rank seventh in Yellow Jacket annals.\r\nChoice's stellar career at Lovejoy High School led to the school retiring his jersey. He was a first-team All-State pick and rated the 14th-best player in the state of Georgia by Super Prep. He also ranked as the 22nd-best running back in the nation by Rivals.com. He rushed for 1,200 yards on 129 carries as a senior and also had 600 yards receiving while scoring 17 touchdowns.\r\nThe tailback enrolled at the University of Oklahoma in 2003, spending the season performing on the scout team. He played in eight games behind All-American Adrian Peterson in 2004, gaining 100 yards on 22 carries (wore jersey #2 for the Sooners), as he earned Academic All-Big Twelve Conference honors.\r\nSensing the continuation of a limited role behind Peterson, Choice was granted his scholarship release, transferring from Oklahoma to Georgia Tech in 2005, where his cousin, Joe Burns (ex-Buffalo Bills) was a standout tailback for the Yellow Jackets (1998-2001). He played behind P.J. Daniels that season, garnering Academic All-Atlantic Coast Conference accolades. He totaled 513 yards with six touchdowns on 117 attempts (4.4-yard average), as he also made 14 catches for 76 yards (5.4 avg).\r\nDespite leading the conference and ranking 13th in the nation in rushing, Choice was only a second-team All-ACC pick in 2006, as he took over tailback chores. He was again named Academic All-ACC, powering his way for a career-high 1,473 yards on 297 rushes (5.0-yard average) with 12 touchdowns. His 1,473 yards rank second on the school's season rushing list. He also gained 98 yards on 12 catches, totaling 1,571 all-purpose yards as a junior.\r\nThe league coaches acknowledged Choice with a first-team All-ACC berth in 2007. Despite missing one game and a half of another, he still led the league in rushing, picking up 1,379 yards with 10 scores on 261 attempts (5.3-yard average). He snared 14 passes for 107 yards and also completed a 17-yard pass for a touchdown. His 1,486 all-purpose yards placed him sixth on the ACC leader boards.\r\nIn 38 games at Georgia Tech, Choice started 27 contests. He rushed 675 times for 3,365 yards (5.0-yard average) and 28 touchdowns, adding 281 yards on 40 receptions (7.0 avg).

While their athletic build is very similar, Cottam has better route-running ability and quickness.

The thing that he does better than most big tight ends is move off the snap to get into his routes quickly vs. the press. The big question: Will his medical chart raise too many red flags?",
                    "Negatives": "For all of his athleticism, his one glaring weakness has been his inability to stay out of the trainer's room, as he has had five surgical procedures and a car accident that sorely hampered his collegiate progress...For all of his athletic promise, his on-field production has been sorely lacking, having just 21 receptions in 38 games spanning five seasons...Better downfield blocker than when operating in-line, as he lacks the ideal body flexibility to redirect and mirror when operating at the line...Has a tendency to duck his head and dive into the defender when asked to block at the line of scrimmage...Needs to do a better job extending for the ball outside his frame, as he is generally the type that uses his body as a crutch, despite displaying soft hands (only caught 5-of-12 passes thrown to him in 2007)...Lacks proper knee bend when trying to redirect and looks a bit stiff in his hips trying to adjust to the ball in flight...Has good straight-line speed, but without good hip wiggle or shake, has to drive through tackles rather than elude after the catch...Needs to improve concentration, and tends to look up the defender before making the catch, resulting in a few drops of easy throws...With his size and arm reach, he should be catching more contested balls than he has, as he doesn't always jump and adjust to take the ball away from the defender, despite having the strength to do so.\r",

                "Overview": "Staying on the football field has been the biggest challenge Brad Cottam faced during his five seasons at Tennessee. \r\nHoping to receive a sixth year of eligibility from the NCAA after he underwent left wrist surgery prior to the 2007 season, he returned for the final five games of his senior campaign after he was denied that additional year.\r\nCottam had flashes of brilliance for the Volunteers. But he has undergone five surgical procedures and was also involved in a car accident that kept him off the football field at various times since arriving on campus in 2003. Along with his younger brother, 6-foot-8 Jeff, the Cottams gave the Volunteers the tallest tight end unit in college football.\r\nAt Evangelical Christian High School, Brad Cottam earned All-Metro Memphis private school team honors as a senior. He was a Super Southern 100 choice by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and ranked as the 12th-best prospect in the state of Tennessee by Rivals.com, a recruiting service that rated him 44th among the nation's tight ends. The Knoxville News-Sentinel rated him the state's eighth-best prospect and the Kingsport Times-News had him ranked tenth on their Super 16 Class of 2003 squad.\r\nCottam served as team captain and was a two-year starter at tight end. During his final season, he had 24 receptions for 340 yards and five touchdowns.  Against Harding Academy (Ark.), he caught a career-best five passes for 120 yards. He was also a standout basketball player, averaging more than 10 points each of his last two seasons. \r\nCottam enrolled at Tennessee in 2003, earning Academic Southeastern Conference Honor Roll recognition while spending the season on the scout team. He appeared in 13 games as a reserve tight end in 2004, coming up with two catches for 34 yards, as he missed spring drill action after undergoing thumb ligament surgery and then battled with a sore shoulder throughout fall camp and into the season.\r\nThe tight end underwent shoulder surgery that would sideline him for 2005 spring camp. He appeared in 11 games that season, but did not catch any passes, as he finished with one tackle playing on the special teams vs. Memphis. He again earned Academic All-SEC honors.\r\nCottam continued to play with shoulder issues in 2006, but managed to start six of the 13 games he appeared in. He snared fourteen passes for 182 yards (13.0-yard average), as his 45-yard reception vs. Vanderbilt was the longest catch by a Tennessee tight end since 2002.\r\nCottam again missed spring drills, as he spent the 2007 camp recovering from April sports hernia surgery. In August, he underwent left wrist surgery after tearing ligaments in fall drills. He did not return to action until the Arkansas clash on Nov. 10, appearing in the team's final five games. He finished with five receptions for 125 yards (25-yard average), registering his first career touchdown vs. Wisconsin in the Outback Bowl."

                    "Compares To": "O.J. ATOGWE-St. Louis...Demps lacks the size and strength you look for in a free safety, but there is no denying his ball-hawking skills. He met with adequate success in a late-season move to cornerback as a senior, but it was evident that his lack of speed will see him get beaten by the quicker receivers at the next level (the opposition averaged 23.92 yards per pass completion vs. Demps at cornerback in 2007). For now, he will bring good value in the sub package, but to move him to cornerback is inviting a quick six for the opposition.",
                    "Negatives": "His frame is built more in the lines of a cornerback - lean with adequate playing strength...Lacks ideal recovery ability, as he dies not show the second gear to recover when beaten...Best as a downhill player, as he does not show suddenness or great range to chase down ballcarriers in long pursuit...Plays with good urgency in run support, but has had marginal production attacking the backfield (only 5.5 tackles for losses in 47 games)...Has improved his work ethic, but needed to be pushed by the staff during his first two seasons (still needs to be monitored, but will do what is asked, nothing more)...Has adequate academic ability and will need more than a few reps to digest the playbook...Has enough lateral movement to play in the short area, but needs to stay tighter on the receiver in deep routes, as he struggles to trail once his man gets behind him...In run support, he must improve his angles, as he does not have the speed to take the wide loop to the ball and still make the play...More of an ankle biter as a tackler, as he attacks ballcarriers at their feet or tries to drag down rather than get in good position to make the wrap tackle...When he takes a side rather than facing up, runners have had success bouncing off his passive hits...Can fill in as an emergency returner, but lacks the burst and acceleration to take the ball to the house at the next level...Can get washed out at the X's, as he lacks the lower body strength to hold position on running plays directed right at him...Footwork needs refinement, as he gets too tall and narrow in his stance, allowing blockers to get into his exposed chest to sustain...His hand punch is lacking when trying to press and they get outside his frame too often, resulting in bigger blockers engulfing him...Has limited run support skills, as he shies away from lead blockers, knowing he will get bounced around if he attempts to clog the rush lanes...Some teams are eyeing him as a cornerback, but in his final six games there, he played the man too cautiously, allowing too much of a cushion and struggled to stay on the receiver's hip ...Plays the ball more often than the man, lacking the physicality to force the opponent to reroute...While he has great timed speed, it fails to translate to the football field (does not carry his pads well, lacing the second gear needed to run stride-for-stride with receivers).\r",
                    "Positives": "Has very good timed speed, showing the change of direction to get to the ball in time playing in space...Has natural hands and ball skills, timing his leaps and elevating well to consistently get to the ball at its high point...His loose hips allow him to close on the ball in a hurry vs. plays in front of him (long speed and range are adequate, though)...Has good eyes and above average route awareness, making quick reads to get a jump on the ball...Plays with better urgency attacking the ball than the man...Plays until the whistle and has a good feel for the route's progression...Flies to the ball in a hurry when he locates it, and has the flexible hips to work his way along the line...Can match up and cover tight ends, running backs or wide receivers when working underneath...Stays low in his backpedal and is smooth to turn coming out of his breaks (needs to hasten up his pace though)...His ability to anticipate the pass and read the quarterback generally has him in the right position to make plays on the ball in flight...Keeps the action in front of him well when playing in the zone as he shows the body control and leaping ability to disrupt the pass before it gets to the target (has 17 interceptions and 24 pass break-ups in 47 games)...Can stall the receiver on underneath routes when he uses his hands to redirect (needs to do this more often, but has had success more at safety than at cornerback in these attempts)...Has the soft hands, good ball skills and timing to compete for jump balls and won't hesitate to go vertical for the pass in a crowd...Did have some fumble issues in 2007 on punt returns, but is generally good with ball security...Despite being a low striker, he shows good body control when tackling (needs to face up and wrap better, though)...Patient kickoff returner who uses his change of direction and balance to weave through traffic...Best when playing in the centerfield area, as he is much better closing on plays in front of him than chasing the ball from behind...Won't bite on pump fakes or play-action, doing a nice job of reading the quarterback before jumping the route (plays in control and won't gamble)...Needs to add more bulk, but his frame can carry the additional weight without having it affect his timed speed...Very good at getting his hand into the ballcarrier in attempts to dislodge the ball from his opponent (four forced fumbles and five fumble recoveries during his career).\r"

                "Overview": "One of the elite pass thieves in college football, Demps' 17 interceptions were the most among active players in the NCAA in 2007 and rank second in Conference USA and school history. He is one of only seven players in college history to gain more than 400 yards (404) in returns on interceptions in a career, setting the league all-time record (331 yards in Conference USA competition).\r\nThe free safety has been a huge problem for not only opposing offensive coordinators, but also opposing special team coaches. In addition to his 17 interceptions, he ranks second in school annals with 24 pass deflections. He also ranks eighth in UTEP history with an average of 22.1 yards per kickoff return. Finding the end zone has become a fact of life for Demps, who scored on interceptions, kickoffs and fumble recoveries during his time with the Miners.\r\nAt Roosevelt High School, Demps was a unanimous All-District 26-5A, All-Greater San Antonio and honorable mention All-State honoree as a senior. He split time at defensive back, wide receiver and punter that year, recording 65 tackles and five interceptions (two for touchdowns). He also picked up 10 receptions for 360 yards and three touchdowns while averaging 40.5 yards on punts. During his last two seasons, he helped Roosevelt High School to a 16-6 record, including a district title in 2001.\r\nDemps added second-team All-District accolades as a junior. He recorded 23 tackles and had two interceptions that campaign, competing as a defensive back and wide receiver. He also lettered at cornerback as a sophomore. He was a two-year letter-winner in track, where he was a regional qualifier in the 100 as a junior and a member of the 1,600 relay that advanced to State. \r\nDemps red-shirted at Texas-El Paso in 2003. He earned Freshman All-American honors and was chosen the Western Athletic Conference's co-Freshman of the Year in 2004. He started 10 of 11 games at free safety, sitting out vs. San Jose State with a hamstring pull. He posted 58 tackles (42 solos), caused two fumbles, recovered one for a score and broke up four passes. He also blocked a kick and had one touchdown on a pair of interception returns.\r\nAs a sophomore, Demps started all 12 games at free safety, finishing fourth on the squad with 78 tackles (47 solos) in the Miners' first season in Conference USA. He picked off three passes, deflected six others and averaged 16.5 yards on four kickoff returns. He also recovered two fumbles.\r\nIn 2006, Demps was named to the All-Conference USA first-team. He led the league and tied for fifth nationally with seven interceptions and broke up five other throws. He ranked third on the team with 67 tackles (31 solos), caused two fumbles and averaged 23.9 yards on nine kickoff returns, including one for a score.\r\nAs a senior, Demps split time between free safety and right cornerback. The team captain was a first-team All-Conference USA defensive pick, adding second-team honors on special teams. His 220 yards gained on five interception returns set school and league single-season records, ranking second in the nation. He totaled 72 tackles (55 solos) with nine pass break-ups and recovered two fumbles. He ranked 15th in the nation and led the conference with a 13.3-yard average on 15 punt returns.

Brohm has the drive back from center and to his pass-set point and the vision scan quickly to locate secondary targets. He is a high-percentage passer and good decision maker who will not force the ball into a crowd. While his arm strength isn't cannon-like, he is capable of making all the throws, showing good patience when attacking the middle of the zone.

Years later, his son, Greg (1989-92) put on a Louisville uniform and start for three seasons at wide receiver, catching 45 passes for 722 yards and three scores for former head coach Howard Schnellenberger. Greg Brohm returned to the university in 2006, taking over as the team's Director of Football Operations.\r\nHis brother Jeff (1990, 92-93), who would go on to start at quarterback for the Cardinals in his three seasons as a letterman, ranks among U of L's all-time leaders for passing yards (seventh, 5,451), touchdown passes (fifth, 38), completions (eighth, 402), total offense (sixth, 6,430) and completion percentage (sixth, .562). Voted the Cards' MVP in 1992 and '93, Jeff Brohm will always be remembered for a gritty performance in leading U of L to an 18-7 victory over Michigan State in the 1993 Liberty Bowl, when he played with pins in his hand. He enjoyed a seven-year career in the NFL, starting in 1994 with the San Diego Chargers. He also played for the San Francisco 49ers from 1995-1997 and was the backup quarterback to Steve Young in 1997. From 1998-2000, he played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Denver Broncos, and Cleveland Browns.

In the 2002 state championship game, he completed 19-of-25 passes for 552 yards and seven touchdowns.\r\nAs a sophomore, Brohm completed 174-of-273 passes for 3,082 yards and 39 scores with only five interceptions. He was also a starter on the Trinity High basketball team that went to the State Tournament for the first time ever and was named player of the game in their first-round win. He was also the hoop squad's MVP, helping the team advance to the semifinals of the state tournament. Much like big brother Jeff, he excelled in baseball and was drafted by Colorado Rockies in the 2002 amateur baseball draft. \r\nHeavily recruited, Brian Brohm decided to continue the family tradition of wearing a Louisville uniform, enrolling at the school in 2004. He was named the Conference USA Freshman of the Year and earned the Commissioner's Medal for having over a 3.75 grade point average. He was selected the team's Offensive Newcomer of the Year and was a member of the Conference USA All-Freshmen Team.\r\nPlaying behind Stefan LeFors, Brohm completed 66-of-99 passes (67.3%) for 819 yards, six touchdowns and two interceptions in 11 games. He owned a 153.51 passing efficiency rating and added 81 yards with a pair of scores on 27 carries (3.0-yard average), as one of only eight true freshmen quarterbacks in the country to see significant time that season.\r\nDespite missing the team's final two games (vs. Connecticut and Virginia Tech) with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, Brohm earned second-team All-Big East Conference accolades in 2005. Under Brohm's guidance, the passing offense ranked ninth in the nation (482.08 yards per game) and he stood second in passing efficiency (166.73). \r\nThe quarterback threw for 2,883 yards, 19 touchdowns and just five interceptions on 207-of-301 attempts (68.8%, the second-best season total in school history), adding three more scores on 41 rushing attempts. \r\nInjuries again kept Brohm from playing a full schedule in 2006, as he was sidelined vs. Kansas State and Middle Tennessee State after suffering a torn ligament in his right thumb, an injury that required surgery. He still managed to rank ninth nationally in passing efficiency (159.08) and total offense (281.27 yards per game), as he connected on 199-of-313 throws (63.6%) for 3,049 yards, 16 touchdowns and five interceptions. He also amassed 45 yards on 47 carries.\r\nBrohm underwent left shoulder surgery (labrum) after the 2006 campaign, but had firmly entrenched his status as one of college football's elite players. \r\nHe was recovered from surgery early in the 2007 season, but while the offense clicked on all eight cylinders, their defense would prove to be their downfall, as the Cardinals failed to earn a bowl berth. Brohm ranked fourth in the nation with an average of 335.33 yards passing per game and finished sixth nationally with an average of 331.5 yards per game in total offense. He connected on 308-of-473 attempts (65.1%) for 4,024 yards, 30 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He scored three times on 57 carries and gained 3,978 yards in total offense.\r\nIn 44 games at Louisville, Brohm started 33 contests. He holds conference and school career mark with 10,775 yards passing, completing 780-of-1,185 tosses (65.82%) with 71 touchdowns and 24 interceptions. He ran for eight scores and 44 yards on 172 carries (0.3-yard average) and caught two passes for a total of one yard. On 1,357 offensive snaps, he generated 10,819 yards in total offense while accounting for 79 total touchdowns."

                    "Compares To": "BRIAN LEONARD-St. Louis-Leonard has better speed, but both are underrated blockers who are better served not being used in the traditional fullback role. Hillis has good value as a short-yardage runner, but to have him carry the ball often would not be beneficial, as he does not have the second gear or speed to make big gains on the ground. He has natural hands for short-area tosses, but his speed issue will prevent him from being lined wide for the vertical passing game. Still, he's a good blue-collar type who can help in a variety of roles, rather than being utilized strictly as a blocker. Every roster could use a versatile player like Hillis, especially in the mid-to-late rounds.",
                    "Negatives": "Undersized for a fullback at the professional level, but does show good power and aggression as a blocker...Bit of a \"tweener,\" but shows just adequate elusiveness running with the ball, especially when asked to take the pigskin outside...Has good explosion off the snap, but lacks the leg drive to power through trash running between the tackles...Had some ball-security issues and needs to do a better job of distributing it away from the defenders when getting into the second level (susceptible to having the ball knocked out by leaving it exposed, especially on returns)...Has had good success as a receiver, but is not used much on upfield routes and is better served being utilized in the short area...Needs to play with better confidence (will get into a bit of a funk after a bad play)...Has had several injuries that lead to durability questions (back injury was the most serious)...Attacks the rush lanes at a good pad level, but needs to generate better leg drive to sustain those blocks, as he can get overwhelmed in tight areas trying to sustain the lane...Does not have the speed to separate past the line of scrimmage and has to rely on his strength to gain additional yardage after initial contact...Won't win any footraces in the open due to a lack of a second gear...Has been used as a punt returner in the past, but does not have the burst or lateral range to be effective in that role at the next level...Hands are smaller than ideal (eight-inch width), which could have led to some fumble issues as a sophomore (four in two games).\r",
                    "Positives": "Lacks ideal size, but shows solid muscle mass, developed thighs and calves and a proportionate build...Good short-area receiver who might not have the speed to get into vertical routes, but does a good job of settling underneath and shows good vision working back to the quarterback when the pocket is pressured...Has a very good work ethic and puts in extra hours studying film...Does not have much hip wiggle to elude, but runs with good balance and body control, getting the bulk of his rushing yardage after initial contact...Tough competitor who will not hesitate to face up to the bull rushers -- will get pushed back when he fails to anchor well -- and is a good contact-seeker chasing down linebackers by taking proper angles in the second level...Alert to the blitz and stunts, doing a nice job in his kick slide when protecting the pocket...Efficient at spotting the crease and does a good job of keeping his pad level down and attacking the line of scrimmage with his shoulders squared...More quick than he is fast, but can break arm tackles...Might lack the speed for vertical routes, but you won't see him drift in his patterns...Has good first-step agility out of his stance, showing urgency getting to the line of scrimmage...Knows how to slip under defenders to get a clean release into his routes...Shows good body mechanics when building his acceleration through the hole...Has good plant-and-drive agility out of his breaks and while he is mostly a one-cut runner, he has the vision and instincts to adjust in his stride...Gets most of his initial yardage by running at a good pad level and pushing the pile with adequate power, as he can break arm tackles, especially when utilized in short-yardage carries...Has the body lean to gain additional yardage falling forward and shows good balance and determination to finish...When he drops his pads, he gets good movement and can move the chains...Uncoils and explodes on contact taking the ball up the middle and has a compact finishing style...Must improve his ball security, but is not a chronic fumbler...Used mostly on swing routes and dump offs, but has enough leg drive to create separation vs. second-level defenders...Also good at running stop routes with effectiveness, showing a good feel for the sidelines...Has good concentration adjusting to off-target throws and has the hands to reach and pluck away from his frame...Demonstrates good hand-eye coordination and, while he lacks deep speed, he can get upfield vs. linebackers and safeties...Can finesse block with good hand placement or hunker down and knock defenders back when leading on sweeps...Will get bounced around some lead blocking up the middle, but uses his shoulders well in attempts to widen the rush lane...Takes good angles into the second level to execute cut blocks...Can adjust on the move and is aggressive looking for targets to hit.\r"

                "Overview": "While Darren McFadden and Felix Jones have been the featured runners in the Razor-backs' powerful running attack the last three seasons, Peyton Hillis was a valuable contributor for Arkansas, and possibly its most versatile athlete.\r\nDuring his time at Arkansas, Hillis was utilized as a fullback, H-back, tailback, tight end, wide receiver, kickoff returner and punt returner. \r\nA punishing blocker, a powerful runner and a natural receiver, he's tied for seventh in school history in receptions (118), ninth in touchdown catches (11) and 15th all-time in receiving yardage (1,195). He added 12 rushing TDs, averaged 10.3 yards per punt return and amassed 2,624 all-purpose yards over 44 games.\r\nA highly recruited player at Conway High School, Hillis was named the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette Offensive Player of the Year as a senior. He was also selected to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette All-Arkansas Team as both a junior and a senior and was a member of the Associated Press Arkansas Super Team. He added Fox Sports Net \"All-South\" first-team honors and won the Landers Award, recognizing the top high school football player in Arkansas. \r\nHillis earned consensus All-Conference, All-State and All-Arkansas honors as a junior and a senior. The Super Prep All-American was ranked as both the top fullback in the nation and the top prospect in Arkansas by the same publication. Named to Tom Lemming's Prep Football Report and Parade All-American squad, he was rated as the second-best fullback in the nation and as the top prospect in Arkansas by Rivals.com. Max Emfinger had him as the top fullback prospect in the nation and he was listed as the third-best prospect in the state by The Morning News. He also earned All-State honors in baseball.\r\nHillis rushed for 2,631 yards and 29 touchdowns, including nine touchdowns of more than 55 yards, on 261 carries (10.1-yard average) in his senior season. His 2,631 yards was the second highest single-season total in Class 5A history trailing only former Razorback De'Arrius Howard (2,746). He earned 100 yards or more in all 12 games that year and caught 12 passes for 172 yards and a touchdown. He rushed for 384 yards and four touchdowns in a win over Russellville as a senior and 1,427 yards and 17 touchdowns as a junior, adding 10 receptions for 143 yards and two touchdowns. \r\nHillis enrolled at Arkansas in 2004. He turned down scholarship offers from Alabama, Oklahoma, Colorado, Nebraska, Tennessee and Michigan, going on to start two of 10 games for the Razorbacks. He was thought to be out for at least six weeks after suffering a fracture of the transverse processes of the L1, L2 and L3 vertebrates vs. the Gators. \r\nHowever, he returned to play three snaps vs. Georgia only three weeks after the injury, starting his first career game as a Razorback. He finished his first year with 240 yards and six touchdowns on 63 carries (3.8-yard average), adding 97 yards and two scores on 12 receptions (8.1 avg) and 128 yards on seven kickoff returns (18.3 avg).\r\nHillis amassed 947 all-purpose yards as a sophomore, starting nine games at fullback and the Vanderbilt clash at tailback. He rushed 65 times for 315 yards (4.8-yard average) and three touchdowns. He led the team with 38 receptions for 402 yards (10.6 avg) and four scores. He added 65 yards on three kickoff returns (21.7 avg), 165 yards on 16 punt returns (10.3 avg) and scored 42 points. He also excelled on the coverage units, posting five tackles.\r\nHillis started nine of the team's first 10 games at fullback before being sidelined for the last four contests of the 2006 season with a deep right thigh bruise. He managed just 57 yards on 13 carries (4.4-yard average) with a score, finishing third on the team with 19 receptions for 159 yards (8.4 avg). He also produced 92 yards on eight punt returns, totaling 326 all-purpose yards while posting three tackles (two solo).\r\nThose totals did not make the fullback happy and he would not accept his injury as a factor for his statistical decline. \r\nFeeling that they were overworking Hillis his first three seasons, new running back coach Tim Horton reduced the fullback's work load as a senior. \r\nHillis went on to start nine of 13 games in 2007, earning second-team All-American honors for his blocking exploits. He carried 62 times for 347 yards (5.6-yard average) and two touchdowns. For the second time in his career, he led Arkansas with a career-high 49 catches for 537 yards (11.0 avg) and five scores. He closed out his final season with 886 all-purpose yards, as his blocking paved the way for the Razorbacks to lead the South-eastern Conference and rank fourth nationally in rushing (286.54 yards per game).\r\nIn 44 games at Arkansas, Hillis started 30 times, including one start at tailback. He gained 959 yards with 12 touchdowns on 203 carries (4.7-yard average) and hauled in 118 passes for 1,195 yards (10.1 avg), including 11 scores. He attempted two passes, returned 12 kickoffs for 213 yards (17.8 avg) and gained 257 yards on 25 punt returns (10.3 avg). He scored 138 points, recorded nine tackles (five solo) and totaled 2,624 all-purpose yards, an average of 59.64 yards per game."

He does struggle in man coverage and tends to get a bit cautious by allowing a big cushion, but he plays with a good motor. He's not really a great playmaker and because of his reckless, hard-hitting style, durability might be a concern, as he's been nicked up in recent seasons.",

                "Overview": "Chris Horton will be remembered as one of the biggest hitters in the Pac-10. He teamed with Dennis Keyes to give the Bruins a sensational 1-2 punch at safety. \r\nPhysicality helps define both Horton and Keyes as prospects. Few college receivers dared to cruise the middle of the field or battle for a jump ball with either player. When the receivers did brave the middle of the field, one of UCLA's two safeties was breaking up the pass or delivering a punishing hit. In his last two seasons, Horton sent seven opponents to the sideline for medical attention.\r\nHorton showed similar traits playing three years playing for him at De La Salle High School. He earned Super Prep All-Southwest/Louisiana, Prep Star All-Region, Max Emfinger's Louisiana Super Team and All-Metro honors. The District MVP was also a two-time All-District selection.\r\nHorton recorded 117 tackles (86 solo), 21 stops for losses, including four sacks, in 10 games during his senior season. He also caused 12 fumbles, recovered four fumbles and blocked seven kicks. As a junior, he made 105 tackles and two interceptions. He was credited with 97 tackles as a sophomore. He also lettered two seasons for track coach James Tony. \r\nHorton redshirted during the 2003 season at UCLA. In 2004, he appeared in nine games, missing three contests after spraining his right foot vs. Arizona State. He posted 27 tackles with two pass deflections and an interception (wore #1). A career-threatening right wrist dislocation limited the safety to six games in 2005, having suffered the injury in fall camp that required immediate surgery. He returned to play in six late season games, totaling 26 tackles (16 solo) and a pass breakup.\r\nAs a junior, Horton took over strong safety duties, switching to jersey #14. He led the Bruins with a career-high 95 tackles (64 solo) and had five stops for losses in thirteen contests. He caused two fumbles, recovered another, intercepted three passes and broke up four other throws. \r\nDespite suffering a concussion vs. Oregon, Horton started every game as a senior, earning All-American and All-Pac-10 Conference first-team honors. He ranked second on the squad with 90 tackles (64 solo), inducing three sacks and seven stops for losses. He recovered and caused a fumble while also deflecting four passes. He was the recipient of the team's Paul I. Wellman Memorial Award, given for All-Around Excellence."

He is an aggressive runner, but his violent running style does lead to leg injuries (cramps, ankle sprains). He is rarely used on the outlet pass and needs to be more patient letting his blocks develop when trying to get past the line of scrimmage. He could make a better safety, but has struggled in the past with field recognition. He has very good timed speed, but lacks that second gear to escape once he gets past trash. If he can get with a patient coach, who can teach him how to pick and slide and utilize the cutback lane better, someone could have a nice change-of-pace back on his hands.

Pittman Most Valuable Player (team) Award.",
                "Overview": "Regarded as the hardest runner among the 2008 NFL Draft class, Allen Patrick has played outside the spotlight for most of his collegiate career. He was a physical strong safety at Independence Community College as a freshman, sitting out most of the following year after breaking a bone in his leg (fibula). \r\nPatrick transferred to Oklahoma in 2005. Sooners' coaches decided to execute a few position changes, moving pro prospect D.J. Wolfe to cornerback, with Patrick taking Wolfe's place as the team's \"caddy\" for All-American Adrian Peterson.\r\nAt Conway High School, Patrick excelled as a safety, halfback and kickoff returner. He earned All-State first-team honors and participated in the Shrine Bowl as a senior. That year, he recorded 105 tackles and four sacks. He rushed for 681 and seven touchdowns on 103 carries and averaged 33 yards a kickoff return including a 92-yard touchdown.\r\nTo improve his academics, Patrick enrolled at Independence Community College in 2003. He earned All-Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference honors as a strong safety, coming up with 91 tackles (61 solo) and 10 stops for losses. He caused two fumbles, deflected seven passes and intercepted two others, returning one for a touchdown. He also saw action on offense, totaling 120 yards with three scores on 24 carries (5.0-yard average).\r\nPatrick was rated junior college's 14th-best player by Rivals.com and 23rd overall by College Football News entering the 2004 season. He was terrorizing Hutchinson College in the season opener, as he blocked a kick and made four tackles with a stop behind the line of scrimmage in the first quarter, but he fractured his fibula, missing the rest of the season.\r\nIn 2005, Patrick enrolled at Oklahoma. He appeared in 11 games on offense, but saw most of his action on special teams, recovering a fumble, as he made eight tackles (four solo) and gained 69 yards on four kickoff returns (17.2-yard average). The new reserve tailback carried 25 times for 136 yards (5.4 avg) and two touchdowns, adding eight yards on four catches.\r\nAs a junior, Patrick appeared in 12 games, sitting out the Texas Tech game with a right ankle sprain. He started five contests in relief of an injured Adrian Peterson, responding with 761 yards and four touchdowns on 169 attempts (4.5-yard average), earning All-Big Twelve Conference honorable mention. He also recorded four tackles (three solo).\r\nEven though Patrick ran for 1,009 yards and eight touchdowns on 173 carries (5.2-yard average) in 2007, he did not receive any postseason honors. His average of 77.62 yards per game rushing ranked eighth in the Big Twelve, as he also caught 10 passes for 56 yards (5.6 avg) and a score. He tallied 185 yards on six kickoff returns (30.8 avg) and registered four tackles (three solo).\r\nIn 36 games at Oklahoma, Patrick started 17 contests on offense. He carried 367 times for 1,906 yards (5.2-yard average) and 14 touchdowns. He caught 14 passes for 64 yards (4.6 avg) and a score, adding 254 yards on ten kickoff returns. He also recorded 16 tackles (10 solo) and recovered a fumble."

He is best when playing inside the box and letting the action come to him. His senior year was a forgettable one, wrought with a highly unusual rash of injuries and this will see his stock drop. He did not redeem himself in postseason all-star games or at the Combine, further pushing down his stock, but while inconsistent, there are flashes that could see him develop into a second-day find.",

                "Overview": "Pressley hoped the 2007 season would be a banner final campaign, but it turned into a weekly visit to the team's training room. Ever since dislocating his left wrist late in the 2006 season, Pressley has been a regular under the doctor's care, as he suffered a left big toe fracture in spring camp and had a gruesome left elbow injury that resulted in three ligament tears in August camp.\r\nHe played with his elbow heavily taped in the 2007 season opener, but then tore cartilage in his knee in an early September non-contact drill, undergoing arthroscopic surgery that sidelined him for several games. Upon his return, he ending up twisting his ankle in the Louisville clash, as his litany of injuries was uncommon for a player that was never hurt throughout his entire football career until his recent misfortunes.\r\nPressley was a Parade All-American and first-team All-USA selection by USA Today at Dudley High School. He was a two-time All-State choice and named the North Carolina Gatorade Player of the Year in 2003.

He collected 43 tackles (27 solos) with a sack, six stops for losses and four quarterback pressures. He also caused and recovered a fumble while starring as the defensive unit's youngest starter.\r\nA toe injury limited Pressley's playing time during spring drills, but he went on to start the team's first 11 games, lining up at right defensive tackle in 10 of those contests and at left defensive end vs. Virginia, but suffered a left wrist dislocation vs. North Carolina. He underwent surgery, missing the team's season finale, finishing with 46 tackles (30 solos), two sacks and seven stops behind the line of scrimmage.\r\nThroughout his rash of injuries in 2007, Pressley started seven of the 10 games he appeared in at left defensive tackle. He was in on 41 tackles (28 solos) with 1.5 sacks, seven stops for losses and eight pressures. He broke up one pass and intercepted two others."

                "Overview": "An electrifying athlete, Eddie Royal wasn't able to fully display his ability as a wide receiver at Virginia Tech. \r\nThe Hokies were limited for much of the season by inconsistent quarterback play. Royal did get to show off his skills in other areas and established himself as the premier punt returner in the Atlantic Coast Conference. He also excelled as a kickoff returner and proved to be a dangerous threat running out of the backfield.\r\nRoyal holds the rare distinction of throwing a touchdown, catching 12 scoring passes, rushing for a touchdown and returning three punts for scores during his career. It was also rare to see a receiver become a school's career leader in all-purpose yards, but Royal is one of the few -- amassing 4,698 yards. His 1,296 punt returns established a new Atlantic Coast Conference career-record.\r\nAt Westfield High School, Royal earned All-State honors as both a receiver and kick returner. He was named the Mid-Atlantic Offensive Player of the Year by Super Prep .and selected the Group AAA Player of the Year by the Associated Press. He was the Washington Post All-Metro Offensive Player of the Year and earned both Super Prep and Prep Star All-American honors following his senior season.\r\nRoyal was rated the best player in Virginia by Super Prep and the second-best player by The Roanoke Times, in addition to ranking 13th in the nation among wide receivers, according to Rivals.com. He teamed with fellow Virginia Tech signee, QB Sean Glennon to lead his team to the Group AAA Division 6 championship with a 14-0 record as a senior.\r\nThat year, he had 41 receptions for 875 yards and 11 touchdowns. He added a 47-yard punt return for a touchdown and a 1-yard scoring run on a reverse in the state title game. As a junior, he hauled in 48 passes as a junior for 905 yards and 11 touchdowns. For his career, he returned 10 kicks for touchdowns.\r\nRoyal arrived at Virginia Tech and quickly established himself, both on the field and in the training room. The Freshman All-American started 11 games at flanker, leading the team with 28 receptions for 470 yards (16.8-yard average) and three touchdowns. He averaged 11.0 yards on 25 punt returns and had the eighth-best kickoff-return average (28.8) in the country, gaining 346 yards on 12 tries, finishing with 1,101 all-purpose yards. He also set a position record with a 365-pound bench press.\r\nAs a sophomore, Royal missed spring drills with a left leg compartment syndrome, but went on to start all thirteen games. He ranked third on the team with 27 catches for 315 yards (11.7 avg) and two touchdowns. He rushed ten times for 79 yards and gained 263 yards on 32 punt returns (8.2-yard average). He also piled up 293 yards on 14 kickoff returns, despite being hampered late in the year by hamstring issues.\r\nIn 2006, Royal earned All-Atlantic Coast Conference second-team and All-American honorable mention. He led the ACC and ranked 12th nationally with a 13.2-yard average on 23 punt returns, adding 431 yards on 19 kickoff returns (22.7-yard average). He gained 24 yards on five carries and finished third on the squad with 31 catches for 497 yards (16-yard average) and three touchdowns while starting nine of 13 games.\r\nRoyal was a second-team All-American and first-team All-ACC punt returner in 2007, ranking 10th in the nation as he led the league with 31 punt returns for 455 yards (14.7-yard average) and two scores. He gained 316 yards on 14 kickoff returns, 496 yards and four scores on 33 receptions (15.0 avg) and 112 yards on eight rushing attempts (14.0 avg).\r\nIn 51 games at Virginia Tech, Royal started 44 contests. He ranks fourth in school annals with 119 receptions, sixth with 1,778 yards (14.9-yard average) and fifth with 12 touchdown catches. He rushed 24 times for 226 yards (9.4 avg) and a score, as he also completed 1-of-5 passes for 53 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. He returned 111 punts for a school career-record 1,296 yards (11.7 avg) and three scores. He added 1,386 yards on 59 kickoff returns (24.5 avg) and holds the Tech record with 4,686 all-purpose yards."

Stevens is a solidly built athlete who could use more bulk, but the added weight would probably affect his quickness. He has good timed speed, but needs route-refinement work, as he is usually late coming out of his stance and looks rigid in his patterns, failing to generate good plant-and-drive agility. He's not the type that can stretch the defense, so using him up the seam isn't a great option. He must anchor better blocking in-line vs. bigger defenders, but when blocking in space, he will usually get the job done.",
                    "Negatives": "Needs to show better suddenness off the snap, as he looks deliberate in his line release and a bit stiff in his hips, appearing mechanical in his running stride (gets too narrow and needs to open his hips better)...Takes a rolling start off the snap and is a step late getting into his routes, even though he gets a quick release from the press...Runs with a choppy stride and will drift out of his patterns on long runs...Better threat over the middle, as it takes time for him to build acceleration (does not always play up to his timed speed)...Better cut blocker or when attacking second-level defenders, as he does not always generate a strong base to prevent the bigger defenders from walking him back into the pocket when working in-line...Won't win any foot races in the open field, but will compensate with good power to break tackles...Has some concentration issues, as he looks to run before properly securing the ball, resulting in drops and fumbles.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a solidly built frame with ideal hand size for his position...Added more bulk and muscle mass to his frame prior to his senior year, but is probably at maximum growth potential without any more bulk impacting his good timed speed (also must play up to that speed, as he needs to refine his start off the snap)...Has a big chest, wide back and thick thighs and calves...Quick to get into position as a blocker, but is mechanical in his initial burst off the ball when trying to get into his patterns...Has the hand punch to defeat a strong press, but also knows how to weave and use head fakes to escape...Has a good swim move to get a clean release...Shows good patience working his way into the zone, but is better served as a receiver on underneath and tight end-delay patterns...Cuts better in the short area (will drift on long routes) and is a good target in the crowd, as he extends for the ball well and has the large hands to reach and pluck for the ball (seems to be better at jabbing in one direction and breaking off his route square when he doesn't have to run long distances)...Has excellent concentration and is fearless fighting through a crowd to extend for the ball, sacrificing his body in the process...Uses his body well to shield the ball from defenders...Has good timed speed to be a threat downfield, but will need to refine his route running skills (does not play up to that speed with consistency)...Fights for yardage after the catch, doing a good job of squaring up and driving through arm tackles...Does not have much shake to elude, but will bleed yardage after the catch with his raw power...Best when playing on the edge, as he has the kick slide, hand placement and punch to mirror edge rushers better than when taking on down linemen in-line...When used on the move, he lowers his pads to drive through hard to widen rush lane...Has the ability to bend and sustain in one-on-one situations and has the body control to get out and attack linebackers, staying in their face until the whistle...Runs his feet to finish and will pancake a second-level defender that gets in his way.\r"

                "Overview": "A mainstay for the team's offensive unit, Craig Stevens appeared in 50 games for the Bears, one shy of the school record of 51 appearances by Daymeion Hughes (2003-06). The three-time All-Pac-10 selection developed into the best blocking tight end in the league and was one of the major reasons for the team's success running the ball the last four seasons.\r\nStevens' blocking skills made the tight end position, mostly an afterthought in the team's attack, a vital asset for California quarterbacks. He did a stellar job protecting passers from backside pursuit, and came up with clutch catches in a crowd when they could not find an open target.\r\nStevens was called \"one of the elite run-blocking tight ends in the country,\" by the Long Beach Press-Telegram, which placed him on its Best in the West first-team as a senior at Palos Verdes Peninsula High School. He was rated the 54th-best tight end in the country by Rivals.com, adding All-Far West honors from Super Prep and All-West Region recognition by Prep Star. \r\nIn his final season, Stevens stockpiled 127 tackles on defense and caught four touchdown passes at tight end. The All-CIF and All-Area pick was also named his team's Defensive Player of the Year and played in the Cali-Florida Bowl.\r\nStevens redshirted as a freshman at California in 2003. He earned Academic All-Pac-10 honorable mention in 2004. That year, he played in every game, starting at tight end vs. Oregon for an injured Garrett Cross. He finished with four catches for 61 yards (15.2-yard average) and a touchdown, adding one solo tackle.\r\nIn 2005, Stevens took over tight end duties, starting all 12 contests. He caught 13 passes for 165 yards (12.7-yard average) and posted three solo tackles. With his 48 knockdown blocks, the team was able to generate 427.92 yards and 32.92 points per game, as Stevens garnered All-Pac-10 honorable mention.\r\nStevens was named team captain in 2006. He started seven of 13 games (team opened with three receivers in the other six contests), receiving All-Pac-10 second-team accolades. He had 17 receptions for 239 yards (14.1-yard average) and a touchdown, one solo tackle and 54 knockdown blocks.\r\nAs a senior, Stevens was an All-Pac-10 honorable mention, starting all 13 games. He matched his career-high with 17 catches, good for 204 yards (12.0-yard average) and three touchdowns. He produced 61 knockdowns, helping the team average 404.62 yards per game and also switching from jersey #82 to #19 for his final campaign."

He has good strength to stonewall the defender, but must be more active with his hands, as he is more a one-punch type than one that will maul his opponent. He struggles getting out and blocking in space and lacks the foot speed in his kick slide to protect the pocket. He also struggles with the shotgun snap and would be a liability in that system at the next level. He is a smart player who gives a blue-collar effort, but you will need to have active guards alongside him. He won't be exposed when executing combo blocks rather than going one-on-one. Simply put, late in the draft, he has value and adds depth, but if a team drafts him early, it will be because they have other linemen to work around him to cover his deficiencies.",
                    "Negatives": "Teams were looking to bulk him up to 325 from his college playing weight of 303, but he participated at the Senior Bowl weighing 284 pounds (though teams still want him to bulk up, he showed much better lateral range and kick slide playing at this weight during Senior Bowl practices)...Has just adequate quickness getting out of his stance and could be surprised by a quick bull rush...More of a position-type blocker, lacing the ideal explosiveness to come off the ball and engage defenders instantly...Struggles taking angles and maintaining balance when needed to work into the second level (not quick at locating linebackers to neutralize)...Has good upper-body strength to stonewall a defender, but after his initial punch, he prefers a finesse style rather than mauling his opponent...Has good balance in his kick slide, but is slow to recoil his hands vs. counter moves and is late picking up exchanges...Gets by a lot on \"field smarts,\" rather than raw strength...Lacks the loose hips to recover and redirect when trying to protect the pocket and will lose the battle vs. defenders with an array of moves (keeps his hands inside too much to latch on and control)...Has a bit of \"tunnel vision,\" as he does not consistently play off his initial block to locate another target...Needs to stop bending at the waist and show better flat feet when operating in space...When he short arms his blocks, he tries to compensate by mirroring, causing him to overextend and then getting jerked off balance...Good face-up blocker, but his lack of loose hips prevents him from lowering his pads and executing proper cut blocks.\r",

He started eight games that season, paving the way for the offense to average 477.3 yards per game, as part of an offensive line that allowed only 21 quarterback sacks.\r\nIn 2006, Sullivan started all 13 games, part of a Notre Dame offense that eclipsed 30 points in eight games and surpassed 400 total yards six times. He cleared the way for tailback Darius Walker, who became the fourth player in school history to have back-to-back 1,000-yard rushing seasons.\r\nSullivan started the first 10 games of the 2007 campaign before his right knee injury sidelined him for the final two contests. After the offense generated 5,728 yards during his sophomore year, it fell off to a total of 2,907 yards during his senior season. Poor quarterbacking was a big culprit to Notre Dame's troubles, but the offensive line allowed 58 sacks, seven more than they gave up in the previous two seasons combined."

                    "Compares To": "MIKE ANDERSON-ex-Baltimore...Like Anderson, Torain can get the tough yardage in between the tackles or in short-yardage situations. He is a physical runner with adequate speed, but lacks the burst or elusiveness to break free in the open field. He shows good vision attacking the holes and patience following his blockers, but is strictly a one-cut runner with marginal hip wiggle. He is never used on complicated pass routes, as he doesn't have the skills to look the ball in over his head, but shows decent pass catching ability for dump-offs. His blocking technique needs complete refinement, as he gets too wild with his hands to sustain. If your team has a lightning quick back and you are looking for one with a little thunder to complement, Torain might fit that role, but he is not one to build your overall running game around.",

                    "Positives": "Builds his acceleration nicely coming out of his stance and into the holes, but can't be considered sudden with his initial step...Has functional initial quickness and  lateral/veer moves to avoid and redirect on the move, but is best when running between the tackles than taking the ball outside...Runs with good balance and agility with the strength to break tackles on contact...Good worker in practices and in the training room and will play with pain...Has good vision and a feel for running the ball up the middle, squaring his shoulders and dropping his weight to push the pile...Hard to take down in isolated coverage, as he has the leg drive to power through and picks his feet up well to sidestep low tackles...Has the valid instincts and anticipation when in space, knowing when he needs to cut back or drive through...Shows strength on contact and when given a step or two to operate, he can break away from the crowd...Even when he runs high on contact, he shows strength and balance to stay on his feet and keep fighting for extra yardage...Has enough lateral agility and veer quickness to redirect and shows good body control when he hits the cutback lanes...Is quicker than fast, but can escape from second-level defenders (just won't win open field foot races)...More slippery than elusive on his short area pass routes...Catches the ball with ease when facing the quarterback (must adjust on the over-the-shoulder throws though)...Better as a cut blocker than working in-line, but shows good vision picking up the blitz...Has the lower body strength to anchor vs. the bull rush, but his poor hand effects him in this area.\r"

                "Overview": "The former junior college transfer had as great an impact in two seasons as any running back in ASU history. A tough runner who is rarely brought down on first contact, he often hits defenders harder than they hit him. Torain combines speed, strength, agility and soft hands and would likely have been vying for All-American honors as a senior, but was sidetracked at midseason by a fractured toe that required surgery.\r\nIn 2006, he became the Sun Devils' first 1,000-yard runner since Delvin Flowers in 2001, as his 1,229 yards on the ground were the most by an ASU player since Freddie Williams totaled 1,427 yards in 1975. In 19 games at the university, he rushed for more than 100 yards in seven contests.\r\nAt Shawnee Mission Northwest High School, Torain rushed for more than 1,600 yards as a senior. He was selected first-team All-League while leading the league in rushing and was named the All-Class 6A tailback in his final season. He once scored five touchdowns in the first half of a game. He lettered twice in football, twice in basketball and twice in track.\r\nTorain enrolled at Butler Community College in 2004, starting six of 10 games, as he totaled 657 yards with nine scores on 119 rushing attempts (5.5 avg). He added 22 yards on two catches and recorded six tackles (3 solos), helping Butler to the national title game as he earned All-Jayhawk Community College Conference second-team honors as a freshman.\r\nAs a sophomore, Torain sat out four games with an ankle sprain, but still finished second on the team with 109 carries for 739 yards (6.8 avg) and 11 touchdowns. He scored 66 points and also returned a kickoff 19 yards while starting four of eight contests.\r\nTorain piled up 1,396 yards with 20 touchdowns on 218 rushing attempts (6.4 avg) in 18 games at Butler College. He caught three passes for 17 yards and gained 19 yards on a pair of kickoff returns. He also recorded six tackles (3 solos) on special teams.\r\nTorain transferred to Arizona State in 2005. He started the team's final eight games, picking up all-Pac 10 Conference second-team honors. He scored seven times on 223 attempts for a team-high 1,229 yards (5.5 avg). He placed third on the squad with 18 receptions for 205 yards (11.4 avg) and three scores, finishing with 60 points and amassed 1,434 all-purpose yards.\r\nAs a senior, Torain started the first six games before his fractured toe would force him to sit out the final seven contests. He still ranked second on the team with 553 yards and five touchdowns on 110 carries (5.0 avg). He also snared seven passes for 100 yards (14.3 avg) and a pair of scores, totaling 653 all-purpose yards.\r\nIn 19 games at Arizona State, Torain started 14 contests. He rushed 333 times for 1,782 yards (5.4 avg) and 12 touchdowns. He caught 25 passes for 305 yards (12.2 avg), including five scores, piling up 102 points while recording two solo tackles.

                    "Compares To": "RICKY MANNING, Jr.-Chicago...Few rookies will have the zone-coverage instincts of Tribble. He is a physical tackler with very good range, but because of size issues and a lack of good man-coverage technique, he will probably bring better value as a nickel back, much like Manning. Tribble's work ethic is not up to snuff with his playing skills and he's going to need to dedicate more hours to watching tape of his upcoming opponent, a venture he has not attacked in the past. He is a cocky player, though he can get too overconfident, leaving him susceptible against a savvy route runner. As a return man, he's nothing special. With his concentration lapses leading to fumbles, it would probably be advisable to not rely on him as a primary returner. While he can be an efficient performer on the field, there are questions as to whether he will ever put in the extra hours needed to refine some glaring deficiencies in his game -- raw power, concentration, game preparation and poor coverage technique in man schemes.",
                    "Negatives": "Lacks ideal size and, while he shows good quickness, he doesn't have the exceptional burst you look for in a return man (shows good trail and mirror technique to stay with the receiver on pass patterns)...Physical tackler, but lacks the raw strength to punish...Character is questionable, as he needs to mature off the field...Gets a bit too confident in his range, allowing a big cushion at times and this has proven costly, as he struggles getting back into the play when receivers get behind him...Must be more alert to route progressions and tends to drift with his ball concentration (will take a few plays off)...Relies a lot on his athletic ability and must show better work ethic, putting in extra hours watching film in order to better prepare for his upcoming opponent...Loses leverage working inside in man coverage (especially on post patterns), as he appears to be late in transition and must improve his timing competing for the jump balls...Called by the previous staff an \"Eddie Haskell\" type and is not regarded as someone with good leadership qualities...Can be fooled by good head fakes and redirection of a running back when trying to make plays on the outside (had just one tackle vs. the run in 2007)...Height limitations make it hard for him to compete with the taller receivers vs. the ball in flight...More of a cover-and-trail pass defender, as he doesn't generate much power behind his hand swipes in attempts to reroute the receivers...Must play with better patience, as he gets reckless in his pursuit for the ball, disregarding his main coverage assignment because of his desire to make plays on the ball instead...Has good timed speed, but fails to show the explosive burst and second gear to recover when beaten...Liability in the running game, as he is tentative in his forward pursuit and gets engulfed often by blockers, as he lacks the size, bulk and hand strength to shed...Does not do it as often as he did as a junior, but he will duck his head at times before delivering the hit (savvy receivers had success bouncing or slipping off those tackles)...Must do a better job of looking the ball in and securing it better on returns, as he tends to run before having the ball tucked away properly and leaves it exposed on his run backs, leading to fumbling issues...Arms are shorter than ideal (29 5/8-inch length) and this will be a problem taking on bigger receivers for the jump balls.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a shorter-than-ideal frame, but is muscular with solid upper-body tone, thick thighs and calves...Has great field instincts, when he maintains steady concentration, and shows good ball skills tracking the pass in flight (needs to time his leaps better)...Has good playing speed and is a fluid open-field runner who might lack the explosive second gear, but does a good job mirroring the receiver...Shows good speed and smoothness in his backpedal and makes transitions quickly with no wasted movement...Despite small hands, he does a nice job of extending away from his frame to look the ball in for the interception...Adjusts quickly when trying to redirect and hits with good force...Hard worker in the weight room and the type that will play with pain, but has had a history of minor injuries that could lead to questions about whether he can stand up to the punishment dished out at the next level...Has very good eyes when reading the quarterback, compensating for a lack of explosion by taking good angles to get into position to make the play...Pesky, gets a good jump on the ball and shows a good feel for keeping plays in front of him...Puts all of his effort into his tackles and is very good at pestering the underneath receivers, reaching around to deflect the pass...Can trail, cover or cushion his man, working hard to maintain position on the receiver (not as effective when the route extends deep when the receiver gets behind him)...Better playing in the zone than in man coverage, as he reads the QB well, getting a nice jump on the ball and works hard to drive on the tight end going for the underneath tosses...Not as effective executing the press as you would like from a cornerback, but he has exceptional timing to get a clean break on the ball (when he keeps his mind in the game)...Although he may lose jump balls to taller wide receivers, he has an outstanding ability to adjust and attack the ball...Can cover up for his mistakes better when he maintains good mirror with the receiver rather than allow a big cushion...Shows good quickness and flexibility to get back through the receiver and break up plays in front (has very good plant-and-drive agility on the 10-yard hook pass)...Might not bump the receiver often, but he has enough range to shadow his opponent in short-to-intermediate routes...Can snatch and pluck the ball naturally, showing the hands of a receiver...Not afraid to deliver a big hit, showing little regard for his own body...Generates good pop on contact, as he will square up and put his hat under the opponent's chin (improved this technique, but will still duck his head at times to make the hit and when this happens, he will throw his shoulders and fail to wrap with his arms)...Runs at a good pad level, which allows him to come out of his breaks quickly...Takes some extra steps to plant, but drives into his break with good quickness...Has good hip snap to get a quick turn on the ball in flight, doing a nice job of looking the pass in over his shoulders...Shows willingness to set the corner and mix it up with blockers in run support...When he lets his blockers set up, he hits the seam with good vision and lateral quickness on returns.\r"

                "Overview": "Regarded by many as the premier cornerback in college football entering his senior season, Tribble's final season wasn't the stellar year most expected. \r\nHe suffered a right knee injury that forced him to the sideline for three late-season games and had been inconsistent when healthy.\r\nAn instinctive athlete with excellent ball skills, Tribble struggled in man coverage, as he constantly lost inside leverage vs. bigger receivers. He has great foot quickness and balance, but that speed failed to translate into a home-run threat when returning punts and kickoffs. Still, he continued to be a physical open-field tackler with good explosion on contact. Teams looking for an immediate contributor in the zone packages are sure to consider Tribble for that job.\r\nTribble was a standout football player who also competed in baseball, basketball and track at North College Hill High School. He earned All-Ohio Division IV honors as a senior defensive back and also played quarterback. He was named All-Midwest by Super Prep and Tom Lemming's Prep Football Report while also gaining 2002 All-City honors.\r\nAs a quarterback, Tribble threw for 790 yards and 10 touchdowns in his senior season. He also rushed for 809 yards and five scores, recorded 94 tackles (63 solo), with four sacks and one interception. He also punted for the Trojans, averaging 40.3 yards per attempt.\r\nTribble enrolled at Boston College in 2003, spending his first season playing for the scout team. He went on to start four of 11 contests at left cornerback in 2004, making 29 tackles (23 solo) with a stop for a loss and a forced fumble. He picked off two passes and returned eight punts for 110 yards (13.8-yard average) and two touchdowns.\r\nAs a sophomore, Tribble started 10 games, sitting out the Ball State contest with a ham-string injury. He still managed to finish third on the team with 57 tackles (48 solo), as he caused a fumble, broke up six passes and intercepted two others. He averaged 11.0 yards on 12 punt returns and 18.8 yards on eight kickoff returns.\r\nTribble earned All-Atlantic Coast Conference second-team recognition in 2006. He started 12 of 13 games at left cornerback, missing the Clemson contest with a left knee bruise that would require arthroscopic surgery after the season. He finished with 49 tackles (41 solo), four stops for losses and a fumble recovery. He gained 108 yards with three touchdowns on seven interception returns, 236 yards on 27 punt returns (8.7-yard average) and 185 yards on eight kickoff returns (23.1 avg).\r\nIn 2007, Tribble managed to earn All-ACC second-team honors again. In 11 games for the Eagles, he posted 35 tackles (31 solo), ranking 11th on the team. He caused a fumble, knocked down eight passes and intercepted four others. He also returned eight punts for 43 yards (5.4-yard average) while allowing his main pass coverage assignments to catch 34 passes for 382 yards (11.26 avg) and two touchdowns on 79 passes targeted into his area (4.85 yards per pass attempt).\r\nIn 46 games at Boston College, Tribble started 37 times. He finished his career with 170 tackles (143 solos) and 10 stops for losses of 19 yards. He recovered one fumble and caused three others. He deflected 22 passes and had 15 interceptions for 145 yards in returns (9.7-yard average) and three touchdowns. He returned 55 punts for 521 yards (9.5-yard average) and two scores, adding 335 yards on 16 kickoff returns (20.9 avg)."

                "Overview": "One of the terms used to describe a defensive lineman is that the player is an efficient \"run stuffer.\" Perhaps no one player has been more important to his team in shutting down the opposition's running game than Joseph \"Red\" Bryant. \r\nIn the eight games that he appeared in for the Aggies in 2006, they allowed just 75.35 yards per game on the ground. In the five contests Bryant sat out due to a knee injury, TAMU was tagged for 229.2 yards per game rushing.\r\nSelected one of the squad captains as a redshirt freshman, Bryant has dominated vs. the run since he first start in College Station. In three seasons in the middle of the Aggies' defense, Bryant has made 83 plays vs. the run, holding the opposition to only 46 yards (0.55 yards per attempt). \r\nAs a sophomore, he was a force, making 31 running plays that saw his opponent be held to an incredible minus-27 yards (minus-0.87-yard average). He followed that performance with 19 running plays for 12 yards (0.63-yard average) during his injury-shortened junior year.\r\nAt Jasper High School, Bryant earned first-team 3A All-State honors from the Texas Sports Writers Association and was one of eight finalists for the Willie Ray Smith Award, presented to the top offensive and defensive players in Southeast Texas. The consensus Texas Top 100 recruit added District and Golden Triangle Defensive Most Valuable Player honors during his senior season.\r\nBryant was the recipient of the 2001 District Defensive Player of the Year Award and was named the Southeast Texas Defensive Player of the Year by the Beaumont Enterprise. In addition to starring on the gridiron, Red also was a standout forward on the school's basketball team.\r\nBryant enrolled at Texas A&M in 2003, competing on the scout team, earning that squad's Defensive Work MVP accolades. He was a \"4x4\" performer during the team's 2004 off-season conditioning program, tying the school record in the hang clean (385 pounds, but has since set a new mark at 407 pounds). He was so well-respected by his teammates that he was named to the Leadership Council and served as game captain in his first year with the varsity.\r\nIn 2004, Bryant took over nose tackle duties, starting all 12 contests. He earned Freshman All-American and All-Big Twelve Conference honors from The Gridiron Report, as he totaled 34 tackles (nine solo) with an assisted sack, 3 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage and three quarterback pressures. He also deflected two passes and blocked a kick. In 33 plays vs. the run, the opposition managed just 61 yards (1.85 yards per carry) vs. Bryant.\r\nBryant added All-Big Twelve Conference first-team and All-American third-team honors from The NFL Draft Report in 2005. He recorded just 30 tackles (eight solo) with three sacks, 8 1/2 stops for losses and a pressure, but also caused two fumbles and deflected a pass. It was his dominance vs. the run that stood out. In 31 running plays, he held the opposition to minus-27 yards (minus-0.87-yard average). What makes that figure even more impressive was the fact that the rest of the Aggies' defense struggled. TAMU allowed 139.18 yards per game on the ground and ranked 107th in the nation, giving up 443.82 yards in total offense per game.\r\nThe team's permanent captain proved what a leadership was all about in 2006. He again manhandled the opposition in the trenches as a junior, making 19 plays vs. the run that netted the opposition just 12 yards (0.63-yard average). He made a valiant effort to play with an anterior cruciate ligament tear in his right knee, but he agreed to have surgery prior to the Texas game. \r\nIn nine games, he had 19 tackles (seven solo), a sack, 2 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage, five pass deflections and a blocked kick. With Bryant sidelined, the team gave up 229.2 yards per game on the ground in their final five contests. However, thanks to his stellar play in the first nine games, the Aggies' defense showed marked improvement, allowing 322.62 yards per game in total offense, compared to 443.82 yards the previous season.\r\nBack on the playing field in 2007, Bryant continued his dominance vs. the run, as he allowed 43 yards on 42 plays directed at him (team gave up 1,491 yards on the ground) in the team's first 10 games. He recorded 41 tackles (11 solo) with an 11-yard sack, six stops for losses of 19 yards and seven quarterback pressures. He also registered a safety on his only QB sack, blocked a field goal and caused a fumble that set up an A&M touchdown drive.\r\nIn 42 games at Texas A&M, Bryant started 41 games. He recorded 124 tackles (37 solo) with 6 1/2 sacks for minus-53 yards, 20 1/2 stops for losses of 92 yards and 12 quarterback pressures. He caused three fumbles, deflected nine passes, blocked three kicks and recorded a safety."

                "Overview": "The classic blue-collar worker, Tom Zbikowski filled a variety of roles for the Irish, especially his most important one -- emotional leader of a young defense. \r\nIn what turned into one of the worst seasons ever by a Notre Dame team, he guided a secondary that ranked second in the nation, allowing only 161.58 yards per game in 2007.\r\nZbikowski, a professional boxer, has worn many hats during his time with the Irish. He has excelled playing inside the box, but has also proven to be a capable punt returner. With his natural hands and nose for the ball, he holds a rare distinction for having scored on an interception return, punt return and fumble return during his career. He has also returned kickoffs and saw action briefly as a tailback during his final campaign.\r\nBy the time he hung up his Fighting Irish uniform, the two-time team captain scored seven career touchdowns (three punt returns, two interception returns and two fumble returns). He is tied for most career punt returns for a touchdown in school history (along with Tim Brown, Nick Rassas, Allen Rossum and Ricky Watters), in addition to being tied for first in career fumble returns for a touchdown (Tony Driver).\r\nZbikowski tied for fifth in interception returns for a touchdown. He holds the school career record for tackles by a defensive back, becoming the seventh player in school annals to register 300 tackles (165 solo). He would go on to start all 48 games he played in at Notre Dame.\r\nAt Buffalo Grove High School, Zbikowski earned USA Today first-team All-American honors and was named Chicago Area Player of the Year as a senior by the Chicago Sun-Times. He ranked 11th on the Detroit Free Press Best of the Midwest team, rated 29th on the ESPN list of the nation's top 100 players and was named Gatorade Player of the Year for Illinois.\r\nZbikowskie was named to the Illinois All-State team by the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times and Champaign News-Gazette. He was selected Great Northwest Defensive Player of the Year by the Pioneer Press, as he set Buffalo Grove career records for points scored (274), touchdowns (45), rushing attempts (406), rushing yards (2,013) and passing attempts (484).\r\nA three-year starter at quarterback and safety who also returned punts and kickoffs, Zbikowski played defensive back in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio, making five tackles and breaking up two passes. As a senior in 2002, he threw for 1,382 yards and 11 touchdowns and rushed for 1,287 yards and 23 scores (Buffalo Grove single-season record), adding 41 tackles and three interceptions at safety. He was a sprinter on the school track team, finishing sixth in the 100 meters at the Illinois state prep track championships in 2002. He set eleven school records in track and field, including the 100 meters at 10.4 seconds.\r\nZbikowski was a nationally-ranked boxer who has competed in the Golden Gloves program since age nine, achieving a 60-13 amateur record. A Silver Gloves national finalist from 1998-2000, he was named Regional Boxer of the Year. He made his professional boxing debut on June 10, 2006, in Madison Square Garden in New York City, knocking out Robert Bell in 49 seconds.\r\nZbikowski enrolled at Notre Dame in 2003, playing on the scout team as a strong safety after turning down scholarship offers from Arizona State, Boston College, Nebraska and Iowa. He took over strong safety chores in 2004, going on to start his next 48 consecutive games. He ranked fourth on the team with 70 tackles (37 solo), as he caused two fumbles and recovered another for a 75-yard touchdown return, adding 22 yards on an interception return and a pass deflection.\r\nAs a sophomore, Zbikowski took over punt return duties, ranking 13th in the nation with 379 yards and two scores on 27 attempts (14-yard average). He returned two interceptions for touchdowns, gaining 136 yards on five interceptions while breaking up four other passes. He caused a fumble and delivered 71 tackles (42 solo) with a sack.\r\nZbikowski struggled early in 2006 with left shoulder and neck strains that forced him to miss the Stanford clash. He was a Walter Camp All-American and served as one of three team captains, as he totaled 79 tackles (44 solo). He caused a fumble that he recovered for a 25-yard score and deflected two passes. He averaged nine yards on 16 punt returns, including one for a touchdown and had five kickoff returns for a 21.7-yard average.\r\nAs a senior, Zbikowski was a Thorpe Award semifinalist. He registered a career-high 80 tackles (42 solo) with a sack, as the team captain caused three fumbles and recovered two others. He picked off two passes and returned 23 punts for 234 yards (10.2-yard average).\r\nIn 48 games at Notre Dame, Zbikowski became the seventh player in school annals to record 300 tackles (165 solo) in a career, adding two sacks for minus-18 yards and six stops for losses of 25 yards. He caused seven fumbles and recovered four others, returning two for a total of 100 yards and a pair of scores. He deflected eight passes and intercepted eight others for 199 yards in returns (24.9-yard average) and two touchdowns.\r\nOn special teams, he gained 757 yards on 66 punt returns (11.5-yard average), including three touchdowns. He also returned six kickoffs for 97 yards (16.2 avg) and carried three times for no gain."

Like Ramsey, Booty won't ever be a threat with his feet and is better served throwing from the pocket than when on the move. He is quick in his ability to get to his throwing point, but does struggle to be fluid in his delivery. He has made progress in locating his secondary targets, but when he starts getting confused and locking on to the receiver, bad things happen, as he tends to hold the ball too long, resulting in a costly sack or having to fire it into a crowd. There is enough athletic talent to earn him a roster spot and he could eventually become a starter, but there are just too many holes in his game right now to ever consider him a franchise-type quarterback.",

                "Overview": "Having produced Heisman Trophy quarterbacks in recent years with Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart, the Trojans coaching staff felt it had the perfect candidate for the award in 2007. \r\nBut Booty didn't strike Heisman gold with injury and inconsistency setting him back.\r\nBooty comes from a family rich in football tradition, which made his journey out West something that the youngster felt he needed to do to establish his own identity. John David's brother, Josh, was a quarterback for the Cleveland Browns who played at LSU for two seasons (1999-2000) following a five-year (1994-98) baseball career as an infielder in the Florida Marlins organization (including 13 games in the majors). \r\nAnother brother, Abram, was a wide receiver at LSU (1997-1999) and Valdosta State (2001). His father, Johnny, played quarterback at Arkansas, Louisiana Tech and Mississippi State, then, coached football at Evangel Christian, where John David Booty rose to national prominence as one of the top prep quarterbacks.\r\nAt Evangel Christian Academy, Booty earned Student Sports Underclass All-American and Class 5A All-State honors as a sophomore and junior. In 2002, he led his team to the Class 5A state title while throwing for 4,144 yards and 38 touchdowns. He also led the squad to the Class 5A state title as a 2001 sophomore, passing for 4,330 yards and 50 scores.\r\nDuring his freshman campaign, Booty completed 9-of-11 passes. In his career, he threw for 8,474 yards on 555-of-864 passing (64.2%) with 88 touchdowns and 26 interceptions. Because Louisiana rules allow junior high students to compete on high school teams if the school is a K-12 school, he actually played varsity football for Evangel Christian since the seventh grade. \r\nPrior to his senior year, Booty's father was fired a the team's quarterbacks coach at the Academy and the youngster decided to bypass football that season, opting for early enrollment at Southern California. Asked why he skipped his senior year of high school, the quarterback replied, \"Because my dad was fired as our quarterbacks coach, I felt like it was time for me to move on. I felt like I was standing up for my dad and for what I want.\"\r\nBooty did not see action during the first five games of his 2003 freshman season with the Trojans. Booty eventually saw limited mop-up action in five games in '03, finishing with 90 yards on 7-of-14 passes (50.0%), but lost 10 yards on a rushing attempt, as he missed the final two contests with a left wrist fracture suffered in the UCLA game. Listed third on the depth chart in 2004, a badly bruised elbow in fall camp forced the coaching staff to grant Booty a medical hardship.\r\nWith Matt Leinart having won the 2004 Heisman Trophy, Booty anticipated taking over quarterback duties in '05 at USC, but Leinart opted to return for his senior year, relegating the youngster to second on the QB depth chart. \r\nFor the 2005 campaign, Booty appeared briefly in 10 games. He threw for 327 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions on 27-of-42 attempts (64.3%) and amassed 316 yards in total offense. On his way to the NFL, Leinart had a few thoughts about his successor, saying, \r\nWith Leinart gone, the 2006 season was Booty's \"coming out party,\" but he was limited in spring camp with a herniated disc in his back that required surgery in late March. He returned to the field fully recovered by fall drills, where he executed the offensive game plan flawlessly. \r\nLate 2006 season struggles, especially in upset losses to Oregon State and UCLA left his junior season unfulfilled, but Booty still ranked first in the Pac-10 Conference in pass efficiency (144.0 rating), total offense (253.38 yards per game), points responsible for (13.85 points per game), passing yards (3,347), passing yards per game (257.46 ypg) and pass completions (20.69). \r\nFor the campaign, he connected on 269-of-436 passes (61.7%) for 3,347 yards, 29 touchdowns and only nine interceptions. He also piled up 3,294 yards in total offense and came up with one solo tackle. His accuracy impressed USC offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Steve Sarkisian, who said, \"Booty is like Greg Maddux in the way he can put the ball in the spot it needs to be.\"\r\nBooty continued his slow improvement in 2007. During the early stages of his final season, the Trojans relied more on the running game. He then suffered a middle finger fracture on his throwing hand after suffering four interceptions in an upset loss to Stanford. The injury would sideline him for the Arizona, Notre Dame and Oregon losses. He played with renewed vigor upon his return, throwing just two more interceptions while connecting on 11 touchdown passes in his five contests.\r\nThe team captain and All-Pac 10 Conference honorable mention finished his senior season by completing 215 of 340 attempts for 2,361 yards (63.2%), 23 touchdowns and ten interceptions.

                    "Compares To": "WILL ALLEN-Miami...Like Allen, there is no questioning Molden's athletic ability and impressive looking frame. The concern is his inability to read and react to the play quickly. He is a good downhill tackler and solid man coverage defender in the short area, but struggles to close on plays when the receiver gets behind him on deep routes. He lacks natural hands for the interception and did not even start a game until his senior year. At his level of competition, he should have dominated, considering the mediocre receivers he faced in every game except the Kentucky clash. Yet, teams were successful on 48.1% of the passes thrown into his area, as he allowed 14.73 yards per pass completion (37 for 545 yards and three touchdowns). Based on athletic talent and his play with the kickoff coverage unit, he could make a nice later second day pick-up, but I feel that his downhill tackling ability would be a much better fit at free safety than playing cornerback at the next level.",
                    "Negatives": "Lacks natural instincts on the field and needs to improve his overall mental awareness and make better reads when operating in zone coverage...Has minimal starting experience and while adequate, he failed to dominate...Has good timed speed, but needs to show it better on the field (does not carry his equipment well)...Not really a physical tackler, but shows functional wrap-up ability...Struggles digesting a playbook and will need more than several reps to retain plays...Just gets by academically and his lack of recognition skills will see him bite on misdirection and play-action too much...Reacts quicker to plays in front of him than when playing in the deep zone...Has a good hand punch and press ability, but does not use it regularly, allowing too much separation on deep routes as he fails to turn and run with the receiver well (has loose hips, but does take false steps)...When he comes out of his backpedal too high in his stance, he will round his cuts...Gets caught out of position vs. shallow routes and needs to react quicker to the ball in flight, especially on deep throws along the boundaries...Despite his timed speed, he does not show the explosiveness to close on the ball...Has good leaping ability, but shows poor timing (needs to get to the ball at its high point better, as he is generally too early going vertical)...Has adequate hands, but they are not natural, as he will trap the ball rather than extend, resulting in more pass deflections that should have been interceptions...Has good pop on contact in run support, but his slow reading skills will sometimes make him too late to impact on the play...When he tackles too high, ballcarriers have had good success sliding off his hits.\r",

Best when reacting to plays in front of him and in the short areas...Has the hand punch to reroute receivers or jam them at the line (needs to use them more often) and has improved his ability to take drive angles (no longer rounds them)...While he can get physical in the bump-and-run, he is more comfortable in off coverage...When he keeps his pads low, he shows very good balance and body control coming out of his backpedal, as he has the loose hips to bail or go vertical (will false step out of his breaks when he plays too tall at the X's though)...Better when playing and settling in space, as he takes too much time digesting action on deep routes, making him a better fit at safety...Has a knack for getting his hand inside to break up the pass on short routes and has good hand placement in attempts to strip the receiver from the ball...Has much better burst closing on plays in front of him (not quick going over the top on deep patterns)...Shows good body adjustments on the move and can elevate well, but must improve his timing, as he tends to leap too early, making him a non-factor on some jump-ball chances...Keeps his feet moving and hands extending while sinking his pads and driving hard with his helmet to take down outside ballcarriers with effective wrap-up technique...Shows no hesitation sacrificing his body to clog the inside rush lanes...Has good hand usage in attempts to shed blocks in closed quarters...Works to stay on his tackles until help arrives and does a nice job of charging the ball carrier and bringing his man down.\r"

                "Overview": "Flying under the radar most of his career, the former University of Toledo talent showed enough in the postseason to see his stock rise considerably in recent months. Molden had a solid week of practices at the Texas vs. the Nation Game, carrying that performance over to a stellar display of athletic skills at the Combine, where he ranked near the top in every agility test for cornerbacks.\r\nWith the size and speed teams look for in a shutdown cornerback, Molden also offers a prospective future employer a player who has excelled as a gunner on special teams. With his tackling ability inside the box, he could see a shift to free safety at the next level to take advantage of his ability to consistently make plays in front of him.\r\nMolden was more known for his track exploits than his skills on the football field during his days at Glenville High School. He earned three varsity letters in both football and track-and-field, as he was a part of three track relay teams that set three national records during his senior year.\r\nIn 2003, Molden enrolled at Toledo, spending the season on the scout team as he was ineligible to play due to NCAA Proposition 48 rules. He finally made it on to the football field in 2004, seeing limited action as a cornerback and free safety. Most of his playing time came on special teams, leading that unit with 12 tackles (6 solos) in 13 games. \r\nMolden was ineligible for 2004 and 2005 spring ball due to academics, and along with the feeling that he would get limited playing time, he decided to transfer. During the high school recruiting period, Eastern Kentucky heavily pursued him. He contacted the school and was offered a scholarship, arriving on EKU's campus in time to compete in 2005 fall drills.\r\nMolden spent the 2005 campaign playing behind Tremayne Perkins at right cornerback. He posted 37 tackles (27 solos) with a stop for a loss and two fumble recoveries. He also broke up a pass and intercepted another. The 2006 campaign saw him again relegated to reserve duty at right cornerback, as he got most of his playing time as a nickel back. He was in on 36 tackles (18 solos) in 10 games, sitting out vs. Tennessee State with a left high ankle sprain.\r\nAs a senior, Molden shifted to left cornerback, starting all 12 games. He finished fifth on the team with 70 tackles (43 solos), including 2.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He recovered a fumble, deflected nine passes and had two interceptions. He also competed in track, as he finished second in the 60-meter dash at the 2007 OVC Indoor Championships.\r\nIn 33 games at Eastern Kentucky, Molden started 12 contests. He finished his EKU career with 143 tackles (88 solos), 4.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage and three fumble recoveries. He broke up 11 passes and also had three interceptions."

He will probably be used as a free safety at the next level due to a lack of bulk, but his timed speed doesn't always translate to the field. Like Pool, he lacks a great feel for the ball in flight and does not have the natural hands. He will be drafted earlier than some expect because of his athleticism. He would have benefited from another year of college football.",

Needs to show more urgency closing on running plays along the perimeter and gets washed out often by bigger blockers, as he tends to get too high in his stance, leaving his chest exposed for the opponent to lock on, jerk and pull him to the ground...Must get more aggressive with his hands in attempts to reroute tight ends and slot receivers...Needs to mature on the field, as he can be taken out of his element after a bad play and does too much talking without backing up his boasts (seems enamored by his athletic ability and is too outspoken, drawing a fair amount of penalties for unsportsmanlike play)...Plays too much with reckless abandon and gambles more often than he should...Needs to time his leaps and extend for the ball at its high point better and while he has made six interceptions in his career, he lacks natural hands and traps the ball too often.\r",

                "Overview": "DaJuan Morgan seems to be following the same path to the National Football League as former Wolfpack standout, and present Arizona Cardinal All-Pro safety Adrian Wilson. Both were standouts on special teams earlier in their college careers before seeing time at safety. Morgan, a junior, hopes that his professional career can as rewarding as Wilson's.\r\nMorgan nearly saw his college career end before it began. He missed his entire senior season in high school after he dislocated his hip in a car accident. When he arrived at North Carolina State as a split end in 2004, he appeared in two games before the coaching staff shut him down due to continued problems with his hip.\r\nThe extra year away from the game proved to be the best medicine for what ailed Morgan. He returned to the playing field in 2005, but made his mark as the leader of the squad's special-teams unit. He used his excellent leaping ability to go on to block two punts during his career.\r\nPrior to sitting out his senior campaign at Suncoast High School, Morgan earned All-Region honors at wide receiver and was the team MVP as a junior. He totaled 2,760 receiving yards and 27 touchdowns for his career, and passed for 1,100 yards and 13 scores, adding 600 yards and seven touchdowns rushing.\r\nAs a defensive back, Morgan recorded 67 tackles with two sacks and three interceptions. He returned five kicks for touchdowns as a sophomore. He also ran track all four seasons and played baseball two seasons. He won the Class 2-A state title in the 400 meters his senior season and was second in his sophomore campaign.\r\nMorgan rejected scholarship offers from Ohio State, Oklahoma and Florida to enroll at North Carolina State in 2004. He appeared in the Richmond game at split end, catching one pass for six yards and competed on special teams vs. Ohio State before his hip soreness kept him on the sidelines for the rest of the schedule. To help improve his recovery, the coaching staff allowed him to compete on the school's track and field team after the 2004 gridiron season.\r\nMorgan appeared in 12 games as a reserve at both free safety and rover in 2005. He led the team's substitutes with 46 tackles (33 solo), including 2.5 stops for losses and a pressure. He had switched jersey numbers prior to the season from No. 34 to No. 7. He had a pair of pass deflections and an interception, adding 43 yards on two carries and had a blocked punt for a 12-yard return.\r\nAs a redshirt sophomore, Morgan ranked fourth on the team with 82 tackles (53 solo), including one for a loss, despite starting just one game at free safety. He was credited with two pressures, a forced fumble and seven pass breakups. He also recovered a blocked punt and had two interceptions.\r\nMorgan received All-Atlantic Coast Conference second-team honors in 2007. He started 11 of 12 games, coming off the bench vs. Boston College, as he lined up strong safety in five games and spent the rest of the year at free safety. He posted a team-high 97 tackles (73 solo) with two stops behind the line of scrimmage. He broke up six passes and intercepted three others, playing alongside his brother, DeAndre, who started for the Wolfpack at cornerback."

Burton has outstanding timed speed and an impressive reach, but is utilized more as a possession receiver because of his ability to move the chains and get a tough first down. He needs to refine his route-running, especially on deep patterns and most of his drops come when trying to catch over his inside shoulder. However, he is a smart, savvy player who knows how to settle into the soft areas on the field and use his frame to shade defenders from the ball. Much like Battle, T.J.

                "Overview": "When Keenan Burton was out of the lineup with assorted injuries -- knee, foot and ankle -- during his career, the Wildcats were a different team.\r\nBack from injury, Burton had a banner junior season. Burton became just the third player in school history to gain over 1,000 yards receiving in a season (1,036) in 2006 and is also the third Wildcat to ever amass over 2,000 receiving yards in a career. His 12 touchdown receptions in 2006 rank second on the school's single-season record list. He also set another Kentucky record by catching at least two touchdown passes in four consecutive games (Mississippi State, Georgia, Vanderbilt and Louisiana-Monroe).\r\nAt DuPont Manual High School, Burton excelled as a quarterback and safety. He earned first-team All-State from the Associated Press and the Louisville Courier-Journal and was named to the Lexington Herald-Leader \"Class of the Commonwealth\" listing of the top-22 seniors in the state during his senior year. He was the sixth-ranked prospect in Kentucky by Super Prep, ranking fifth in the state and among the nation's top fifty defensive backs, according to Rivals.com and Prep Star. He also added All-County and All-District honors as a junior and senior.\r\nThe MVP of the Kentucky/Tennessee HS All-Star Game in the summer of 2003, Burton helped his school reach the Class AAAA state playoffs four consecutive seasons. He started the last three of his four seasons with the team, lining up mostly at quarterback on offense, although he did see some action as a receiver, running back, and kick returner.\r\nBurton carried the ball 274 times for 1,634 yards (6.0-yard average) and 25 touchdowns during his career. He completed 81 of 226 passes (35.8%) for 1,605 yards and 17 scores. He also recorded 98 tackles, along with 30 pass deflections and 10 interceptions, returning two of those picks for touchdowns, adding another score on a punt return. \"Keenan has the quickest first step I've seen in a long time,\" said Manual High coach Joe Nichols. \"He has really deceptive speed and great hands.\"\r\nBurton also lettered in track, competing in the 400- and 800-meter dashes, 4x200-, 4x400-, and 4x800-meter relays, the long jump, and the triple-jump. He competed in the state meet in all three relays and both jumps. He was a member of the school's student council and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.\r\nBurton enrolled at Kentucky in 2003, turning down scholarship offers from Northwestern, Indiana, Marshall, Louisville, Miami (Ohio) and Boston College. The son of former Morehead State football and track participant, Ed Burton, Keenan Burton earned Knoxville News-Sentinel Freshman All-Southeastern Conference honors that season. In 12 games, he made five starts at split end. He ranked fifth on the team with 20 receptions for 221 yards (11.1-yard average) and a pair of touchdowns, with 11 catches for first downs.\r\nPrior to the 2004 season opener, Burton suffered a left wrist fracture. He appeared in the team's first two games before the coaching staff applied for a medical hardship. He had just two catches for 13 yards, adding 88 yards on three kickoff returns (29.3-yard average) before spending the rest of the season on the sidelines.\r\nInjuries continued to plague Burton in 2005, as he appeared in only seven games while twice undergoing right foot surgery (in September, 2005, and again in January, 2006) to repair a broken bone. He still finished third on the team with 24 catches for 365 yards (15.2-yard average) and a pair of touchdowns and 15 grabs produced first downs, converting four third-down grabs and one on fourth down. He returned five kickoffs for 183 yards (36.6 avg) with a long of 93 yards and also had a 30-yard punt return.\r\nInjury-free for the first time since 2003, Burton had a banner junior season. He earned All-Southeastern Conference first-team honors as an all-purpose back and second-team accolades as a receiver. Named one of the team's captains, he also took over kickoff-return duties, ranking second in the SEC with 765 yards and a touchdown on 31 attempts (24.7-yard average) and gained 51 yards on four punt returns (12.8 avg).\r\nAs a receiver, Burton became the third player in school history to gain over 1,000 yards in a season, as he caught 77 passes for 1,036 yards (13.5-yard average). His 12 touchdowns rank tied for second on the single-season chart. His average of 5.92 receptions per game ranked 14th nationally while his 79.69 yards receiving per game placed him 21st in the NCAA Division 1-A ranks. \r\nHis average of 141.92 all-purpose yards per game ranked ninth in the nation and second in the conference. Of his 77 grabs, 49 produced first downs, as six of those catches came on third-down plays and another on fourth down. Of his catch total, 14 were for at least 20 yards. He had big plays that set up 20 touchdown drives and five other series that ended with field goals.\r\nBurton continued his torrid pace in the early stages of the 2007 season, but flu-like symptoms and right knee and ankle sprains limited his playing time over the second half of the year. He still managed to lead the team with 59 receptions for 685 yards (11.6-yard average) and nine touchdowns. He ranked sixth in the Southeastern Conference with a 24.25-yard average on 28 kickoff returns for 679 yards, adding nine yards on a punt return. He ranked sixth in the league with an average of 124.82 all-purpose yards per game.\r\nIn 45 games at Kentucky, Burton started 31 games. He ranks fourth in school history with 182 receptions and third with 2,320 yards (12.7-yard average). His 25 touchdown grabs rank second on the Kentucky all-time list. He rushed eight times for 18 yards (2.3-yard average) and gained 90 yards on six punt returns (15.0 avg). He totaled 1,715 yards with a touchdown on 67 kickoff returns (25.6 avg). He also became the fifth player in school history to amass over 4,000 all-purpose yards in his career, ranking third on the UK all-time list with 4.143 yards. He added two solo tackles and recovered two fumbles."

                    "Negatives": "Has had several issues with his right knee and also had left foot plantar faciitis, making his durability a concern...Needs better lower body muscle definition, especially in his calves...More of a waist bender and lacks explosion coming off the snap because of it...Gets too tall in his stance and narrows his base, causing him to spend a lot of unnecessary time on the ground (defenders have good success upending him)...Shows stiffness in his hips and lacks good balance on the move, negating a possibility of making him a pulling guard...Occasionally flashes knee-bend, but is more of a waist-bender and a short-stepper who lacks quick, light feet...Flashes some nastiness, but needs to work on finishing blocks more consistently...Lacks good short-area quickness and feet to switch off and make good angle blocks...Performs better on double-teams than he does in one-on-one battles...Has marginal ability to sustain blocks, as he engages opponents with his helmet and hands in the defenders' chests, at times, working into position, but waist-bends and slides off too soon...Occasionally latches on to defenders and moves his feet to run-block, but is usually too high here...Gathers himself with his head down when run-blocking and doesn't always fire off the ball...Has marginal ability to pull or trap...An adequate athlete, at best, who doesn't cover ground real well...Will lead through the hole with his head down and miss the target, at times...Gets to the second level too slowly and linebackers often get over the top of him...Has only adequate ability as a pass-blocker and he catches bull rushes too often, resulting in him getting knocked back...Will hold when he's beaten around the edge and shows just adequate hand usage and punch...Often catches and gets his hands outside his opponent's frame, rarely engaging and latching on to the defender inside and must generate a stronger hand punch...Possesses marginal foot quickness, as he is a hard, short-stepper whose feet don't move very quickly.\r",

                "Overview": "The veteran anchor of the Buckeyes' front wall, Barton was the team's mainstay at right offensive tackle since his freshman campaign. Injuries limited the tackle the last few years, but when healthy he showed he is a powerful, explosive blocker who plays low in his pads and with great intensity. He works hard at sustaining his blocks and allowing plays to develop and has become a good pass blocker because of his balance and mobility.\r\nBarton was considered one of the top linemen in the Midwest and one of the Top 100 nationally by Rivals.com as a senior at Perry High School. He played defensive tackle and tight end and simply overpowered opponents. He also lettered in basketball as a freshman and sophomore, but then concentrated on football his final two years. \r\nIn 2003, Barton enrolled at Ohio State, spending the year competing as an offensive tackle on the scout team until he suffered a left shoulder sprain that required surgery at mid-season. He was held out of 2004 spring drills while recovering from shoulder woes and then lined up at right tackle behind Tim Shafer for the first five games. The OSU ground game struggled with Shafer in the lineup, averaging 111.8 yards per game. When Barton took over those chores for the final seven contests, the Buckeyes averaged 169.43 yards per game on the ground.\r\nBarton started eight of nine games at right tackle in 2005. He sat out the Michigan State, Indiana and Minnesota contests and played just one series vs. Illinois due a right knee anterior cruciate ligament tear. As a junior, he battled left foot plantar fasciitis all season, but started all 13 games, earning team Offensive Lineman of the Week honors four times. He registered 61 knockdowns with eight touchdown-resulting blocks. The offense thrived under his pass protection, as OSU quarterbacks averaged 214.7 yards per game passing and the team had 31 touchdown passes and just six interceptions.\r\nBarton was named All-Big Ten Conference first-team in 2007. He allowed just one sack while registering 74 knockdowns with eight touchdown-resulting blocks. He made seven of those touchdown blocks on running plays, as the Buckeyes averaged 196.4 yards per game on the ground.\r\nAt the 2008 Senior Bowl practices, Barton suffered a right knee strain. An MRI revealed no structural damage, but he was forced to miss the game and underwent an arthroscopic procedure Jan. 24 that prevented him from participating in agility tests at the NFL Combine."

Caldwell has the second gear to get into routes quickly and takes pride in his ability to stretch a defense and make his opponent account for him on every play. He needs to add more strength and show more intent as a blocker. He also has had some durability concerns the last two years.

He relies more on his explosion to elude (one-cut runner with a little stiffness in the hips)...Uses his hands well vs. the press, but does not have enough raw power to defeat the jam vs. more physical defensive backs (see 2007 Troy, Florida Atlantic and Michigan games)...Good character, but has one known off-field incident (see below) and has never relished leadership, despite being named one of the team's four captains in 2007...Can take the ball up the wedge as a kickoff returner, but lacks the shifty moves to bounce outside and elude...Has natural hands, but prefers to body catch and is inconsistent plucking away from the frame in order to protect the ball from defenders...More of a pest-type blocker in the second level and gets good hand placement blocking at the line, but struggles some to sustain vs. a strong bull rush (needs better lower-body strength)...Has to develop looser hips in order to shift gears and redirect when on the move...Plays with good toughness, but does not have the strength to compete for balls in a crowd...Has the speed to get upfield quickly, but he is not a shifty runner, lacking the wiggle or change-of-direction to bounce off tacklers...Will shy away from contact working on the line and is not physical when facing up vs. the blitz (not always interested in getting himself dirty, failing to generate much pop behind his hits).\r",

                "Overview": "To truly appreciate Andre Caldwell's football skills, you must look at what he does without the football and not judge him strictly on his statistics. \r\nA punishing in-line and second-level blocker, Caldwell has proven to be a playmaker with the ability to strike from anywhere on the field, whether it is catching, running, throwing or returning the ball. He is the type of player opposing defenses must account for anytime he is on the field. The Florida game plan did not afford him many touches, but when he did get his hands on the ball, good things happened.\r\nThe brother of Reche Caldwell, Andre Caldwell plays with the same physical style of his elder sibling. However, he has had durability issues that forced him to miss 11 games over the last three years. Still, Andre Caldwell went on to set the school record with 185 receptions, the ninth-best total in Southeastern Conference history. \r\nAt Thomas Jefferson High School, Caldwell earned All-American honors from Parade and Super Prep (also rated the third-best receiver in the nation and fourth-best overall prospect in the state of Florida by Super Prep). Rivals.com listed Caldwell as the best receiver in the national prep ranks and the premier offensive player in the Southeast. BorderWars.com placed Caldwell third among the nation's receivers, as he also added USA Today All-USA second-team honors.\r\nThe first-team Class 4A All-State receiver was named to the Sunshine Network's All-Gridiron Team, adding 2001 Tampa Tribune Hillsborough County Player of the Year honors. As a senior, Andre passed and rushed for over a combined 2,200 yards, scoring 38 touchdowns, as he led his team to a 13-2 record and the Class 4A state championship game. He also scored on four punt returns in 2002 and was a standout in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl. During his junior campaign, he caught 52 passes for 1,162 yards (22.3-yard average) and 17 touchdowns.\r\nThe Sporting News named Caldwell to the All-Southeastern Conference Freshman team during his first season at Florida in 2003.

He managed to grab 10 passes for 148 yards and run for 64 yards, including a touchdown, on five carries (12.8-yard average). Caldwell returned four kickoffs for 124 yards (31.0 avg) and was averaging 112.0 all-purpose yards per game before the injury.\r\nCaldwell came back better than ever in '06.

                    "Compares To": "CHRIS McALISTER-Baltimore...Cason's game is similar to that of the Ravens' McAlister, another former Arizona cornerback. He looks natural making plays on the ball in flight, showing the long arms and reach to get to the ball at its high point. He does a nice job of keeping plays in front of him, but needs to get more aggressive with his hands, as he lacks the placement and strength to consistently reroute receivers. He has good timed speed, but appears to lack the second gear to explosively close on the ball. Opponents challenged him often in 2007, targeting 73 passes into his area, as they averaged 11.2 yards on their 23 completions, but he has very good timing and ability to deflect the pass, obvious by the 50 passes that his coverage assignments failed to catch.",

                "Overview": "A shutdown cornerback in the mold of former Arizona standout Chris McAlister (Baltimore), Cason ranks with the elite defensive prospects eligible for the 2008 NFL Draft. With his added responsibility handling punt returns as a senior, he is the first Arizona player to earn All-Pac-10 Conference accolades on defense and special teams in the same season.\r\nCason comes from a family rich in sports tradition. His father, Wendell, was a defensive back at the University of Oregon (1981-84) and went on to play for the Atlanta Falcons (1985-87). Antoine's brother, Dione, ran track at Washington State. His cousin, Ken-yon Rambo, was a receiver at Ohio State (1997-2000) before playing for the Dallas Cowboys (2001-02) and New York Jets (2003). Another cousin, Aveion Cason, was an All-American tailback at Illinois State (1997-2000) and presently plays for the Detroit Lions (2001-02, 2006-present) after seeing stints with St. Louis (2001, 04-05) and Dallas (2003) in his career.\r\nAt Los Alamitos High School, Antoine Cason earned second-team All-CIF Southern Section and first-team Division I All-CIF honors as a senior. He was a member of the Tacoma News-Tribune Western 100, Prep Star All-American and Super Prep All-Farwest squad. He earned from Rivals.com a three-star rating and was ranked 38th among the nation's defensive backs. \r\nAs a senior, Cason recorded 41 tackles, four interceptions and two fumble recoveries. He added first-team All-League as a junior, as he registered six interceptions. The Sunset League Defensive Back of the Year and first-team All-League pick as a senior, he added Orange County Register first-team All-County honors that year. He also competed as a running back and lettered in track.\r\nUpon enrolling at the University of Arizona in 2004, Cason was thrust into the starting lineup at left cornerback, where he would go on to start all 46 games during his collegiate career. He earned All-Pac-10 Conference honorable mention and was selected to the Football Writers Association and The Sporting News Freshman All-American teams. He also garnered TSN Pac-10 Defensive Freshman of the Year honors.\r\nHe finished 2004 with 70 tackles (54 solo), 5 1/2 stops for losses, four interceptions, six pass breakups and three forced fumbles. He ranked fifth in the Pac-10 in interceptions, fifth in forced fumbles and ninth in passes defended. He began his career in explosive fashion, as he was named Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Week after posting 13 tackles (12 solo), including one for a loss, forced two fumbles, broke up one pass and returned an interception four yards vs. Northern Arizona.\r\nIn 2005, Cason ranked fifth on the squad with 50 tackles (38 solo), including 2 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He deflected five passes and intercepted three others while playing strong-side cornerback. He was also named to the All-Pac-10 Conference second-team. After the season, he joined the Wildcats' 2006 outdoor track team, performing in the sprints and relays.\r\nAs a junior, Cason received first-team All-Pacific-10 Conference honors, becoming just the fifth cornerback in UA history to do so. The semifinalist for the Thorpe Award was also a two-time Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Week (vs. Washington State and California). He ranked third on the team with 62 tackles (48 solo), including two stops for losses. He caused and recovered a fumble, batted away seven passes and had three interceptions. He again competed on the 2007 Wildcats outdoor track team after the football season.\r\nCason earned All-American first-team honors from The NFL Draft Report and Rivals.com in 2007. He added All-Pac-10 Conference first-team honors as a defensive back and return specialist. He ranked fifth in the league with 27 punt returns for 271 yards (10.0-yard average) and a pair of touchdowns. He tied with teammate Nate Hess for second in the Pac-10 with five interceptions, returning two pass thefts for scores. He deflected 14 passes and was third on the squad with a career-high 71 tackles (56 solo), including one sack and four stops behind the line of scrimmage. He was a finalist for the Thorpe Award and semifinalist for the Bednarik Award. \r\nCason started all 46 games during his Arizona career. He ranks fourth in school history with 15 interceptions, shattering the old Wildcats record with 349 yards in returns and a career average of 23.26 yards per interception return. He deflected 32 passes, caused five fumbles and recovered another. He also registered 253 tackles (196 solo) with a six-yard sack and 14 stops for losses of 43 yards. In his only season as a punt returner, he totaled 271 yards with a pair of touchdowns on 27 attempts (10.04-yard avg)."

He is not fluid enough to maintain position and mirror from left tackle. He has incredibly long reach and large hands and hits with good pop, but he is inconsistent shooting those hands and needs to be more active or it will negate one of his better assets. Struggled quite a bit with the snap count as a senior, resulting in a slew of penalties. If judged on what he did at right tackle in 2006, he will be an early-round pick.",
                    "Negatives": "Needs help in pass protection, as he gets his feet too wide at times and this causes him to struggle to recover vs. quick-twitch defensive linemen...Possesses only adequate initial quickness and questionable change-of-direction agility, as he appears too stiff in his hips to fluidly redirect...Has the raw power to jolt the defender with his hand punch, but is too inconsistent using it, preferring to keep his man at bay with his long reach rather than attack him...Needs to extend through his hips and explode more often coming off the snap...Susceptible to explosive edge rushers, despite his timed speed, as he fails to generate the hip snap needed to mirror...Possesses good pulling speed, but shows only adequate balance and body control when adjusting at the second level...Displays marginal footwork in pass protection, stepping behind himself and giving up ground to defenders too often, as he tends to lunge with his head...Has a strong hand punch, but lacks hand quickness and technique, showing inconsistent placement (defenders can slip off his blocks with good cross-face or counter moves)...Slow to kick-slide and shows only adequate ability in this area...Needs to concentrate better on the field, as he is prone to mental lapses that lead to a slew of costly penalties.\r",

                "Overview": "After starting 37 consecutive games at right tackle, Gosder Cherilus moved to the demanding left tackle position as a senior. It is an understatement to say that he struggled most of the year at that position. \r\nPenalties -- seven total and four vs. Notre Dame -- were his worst enemy. Cherlius allowed 5 1/2 quarterback sacks and four pressures, acceptable totals when the offense throws the ball 659 times in a season.\r\nWith his limited change-of-direction agility, along with a solid reputation as a mauler for the ground game, Cherilus would welcome a return to right tackle at the next level. The Haitian is a tireless worker and with patient coaching, he could join the long line of steady Boston College offensive linemen now playing in the NFL. Cherilus closed out his career with 51 consecutive starts for the Eagles, establishing a new school record.\r\nCherilus was a Boston Globe and Boston Herald All-Scholastic selection as a senior at Somerville High School, where he played tackle on both sides of the ball. He was named to Tom Lemming's All-American team in 2002, the same season that he captured All-State accolades from the Massachusetts State Coaches Association. Cherilus also participated on Somerville's basketball and track teams. \r\nCherilus spent the 2003 season at Boston College performing with the scout team, as the coaches afforded him an extra year to fully recover from right knee surgery. He was the only redshirt freshman to start on BC's offensive line in 2004, helping the team average 385.4 yards per game in total offense.\r\nAs a sophomore, he started all 13 games at right tackle, delivering 53 knockdown blocks. The Eagles went on to lead the Atlantic Coast Conference in total offense, averaging 387.75 yards per game.\r\nIn 2006, his drive-blocking skills saw the team have at least one 100-yard rusher in seven games. Cherilus made 79 knockdowns, along with 10 touchdown-resulting blocks. With the right tackle leading the way, the Eagles averaged 355.6 yards per game. He also made a key tackle vs. Navy in the Meineke Car Care Bowl.\r\nThe recipient of the team's Unsung Hero Award in 2007, Cherilus also garnered All-Atlantic Coast Conference second-team honors. With the ground game a liability, the team took to the air, ranking seventh in the nation with an average of 323.9 passing yards per game. Even though he struggled with his timing, the left tackle came up with 77 knockdowns and 12 touchdown-resulting blocks in 14 games."

                "Overview": "Joe Paterno's first perfect season came in 1968, his third year of coaching the Nittany Lions. Ever since, the Penn State coaching staff has produced an incredible number of NFL-quality linebackers who had success at the next level. \r\nFrom Dennis Onkotz in 1968 to Paul Posluszny in 2006, Penn State boasted 16 linebackers garnering All-American first-team honors, with Onkontz ('68-69), Shane Conlan (1985-86), LaVar Arrington (1998-99) and Posluszny ('05-06) receiving that prestigious honor twice.\r\nAt the end of his standout '07 season, Dan Connor became Joe Pa's Sweet 17th.\r\nIn addition to his All-American selection, the PSU middle linebacker was the recipient of the Bednarik Award (top defensive player), was a finalist for the Butkus Award and set the school record with 419 career tackles while his 145 tackles in 2007 led the Big Ten Conference and ranked seventh in the nation. \r\nConnor comes from a family of football players. The Crime, Law and Justice major learned from his older brothers and became the third sibling to play in the collegiate ranks. Jim played football at Boston College and Mike played at Lehigh. But even before he stepped on the field at Penn State, Dan Connor earned national attention.\r\nAt Strath Haven High School, Connor was a consensus All-American, and the four-year starter was selected the nation's top prep linebacker by Parade. He earned first-team All-American accolades from USA Today, Super Prep and numerous other media outlets. The 2003 Associated Press Big School Player-of-the-Year, Connor was named first-team All-State three times. He also earned All-Region, All-City, All-County and All-League honors.\r\nThe captain and MVP of his team, Connor also won the Maxwell Football Club's prestigious Jim Henry Award as the Philadelphia Area Player-of-the-Year and was the Philadelphia Inquirer Southeastern Pennsylvania Player-of-the-Year as a senior. He totaled 4,556 rushing yards and 77 touchdowns during his prep career. Defensively, he made 451 tackles, 18 sacks, 16 interceptions and six fumble recoveries. \r\nAs a senior, Connor rushed for 1,807 yards on 251 carries, for a spectacular 7.2-yard average, scoring 28 touchdowns. He was instrumental in Strath Haven winning the 2000 Pennsylvania Class AAA state championship and played in the AAA state title game in 2001 and '02. He played in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in 2004 and also lettered in basketball and track, where he participated in the high jump, javelin, discus and shot put. \r\nConnor enrolled at Penn State in 2004, appearing in 10 games while earning four starting assignments. \r\nAfter lining up at outside linebacker most of the season, the Freshman All-American shifted to middle linebacker for the season's final three games, leading the team in tackles in each of those contests. In 558 plays, he finished second on the team with 85 tackles (50 solo), adding a sack, 4 1/2 stops for losses and an interception.\r\nDuring the 2005 offseason, Connor was charged with making prank phone calls to a former PSU assistant coach. Joe Paterno suspended the linebacker in August for his involvement in the incident, keeping him out of the lineup for the team's first three games. He started six of the nine contests in which he played, posting 76 tackles (38 solo), 1 1/2 sacks and 5 1/2 stops for losses, to go along with eight quarterback pressures from his right outside linebacker position. He also recovered a fumble that he returned for a score.\r\nIn 2006, Connor gained national attention for his exploits on the football field, walking away with All-American and All-Big Ten Conference first-team honors. He combined with fellow All-American Paul Posluszny (116 tackles) to become the first Penn State tandem since Andre Collins (130) and Brian Chizmar (110) in 1989 to record more than 100 tackles in a season. \r\nThe right linebacker started all 13 games, participating in 908 snaps. He finished second to Posluszny with 113 tackles (70 solo), adding five sacks, nine stops for losses and three forced fumbles. He also deflected a pair of passes and intercepted two others.\r\nConnor and Posluszny will be forever linked. The two star linebackers squared off against each other in the 2002 PIAA Class AAA championship game. Posluszny, then a senior, led Hopewell High School to a 21-10 victory against Connor's Strath Haven team. \r\nPosluszny later served as Connor's host for his official visit to Penn State. Both broke into the starting lineup as freshmen at Penn State, albeit a year apart. \"If you ask me, I'd say Paul's better,\" Connor said. \"If you ask him, he'd probably say the opposite.\" \r\nConnor joined Posluszny as one of three finalists for the Bednarik Award in 2006, as Connor became the 13th Penn State linebacker to earn first-team All-American honors under Paterno. He was the 77th Penn State player selected a first-team All-American.\r\nConnor moved back inside to middle linebacker as a senior. He finished seventh in the nation in tackles and led the conference with a career-high 145 stops (69 solo). He delivered 6 1/2 sacks with 15 stops for losses and two fumble recoveries. He also picked off a pass and deflected six others. He would record at least 10 tackles in eight contests, giving him 20 games during his career that he reached double digits.\r\nConnor started 36 of 45 games in which he played at Penn State, including 16 contests at middle linebacker. He holds the school's career record with 419 tackles (227 solo), produced 14 sacks for minus-101 yards and 34 stops for losses totaling 141 yards. He recovered three fumbles, returning one 18 yards for a touchdown and had three forced fumbles. He deflected eight passes, gained five yards on four interception returns and registered one safety."

He is a very good edge rusher and blitzer who relies a lot on his quickness to surprise a lethargic blocker.

He is quick to see the play develop, but it is rare for him to come out of his area to make a play. He is too stiff in his hips to get good depth in his pass drops and struggles with ball recognition when playing in the zone, as he does bite on play-action. He will need to improve his lower body strength for the next level, as his only value right now is as a pass rusher.",

Shows more quickness than speed as a speed rusher, but has a long stride and range to get to the ball...With his pass rush skills, he can create havoc in the backfield, but must be more conscious of sinking his hips to generate the extra burst needed to seal the deal.\r"

                "Overview": "An emerging talent at the strong-side linebacker position, Crable reminds some scouts of Carl Banks, an All-American at that position for the Wolverines' arch-rivals, Michigan State, who went on to earn All-Pro honors during a stellar career with the New York Giants. The talented youngster has the same excellent read-and-react skills and playing strength, doing a great job of attacking the backfield coming off the edge that Banks showed throughout his college and professional career.\r\nWith Crable's tall and rangy frame, some talent evaluators feel he could bulk up for a possible switch to the defensive line, where his pass rushing and pass coverage skills could excel as a hybrid linebacker/defensive end. Evident by his 28.5 tackles behind the line of scrimmage as a senior, the Wolverine has proven to be among the elite blitzers in the 2008 NFL Draft pool.\r\nAt Washington High School, Crable was an All-State first-team linebacker as a senior and rated the eighth-best player in the nation at his position by Tom Lemming, who chose him for his Prep Football Report 2003 Super Team. He was also rated the eighth-best strong-side outside linebacker in the nation by MaxEmfingerRecruiting.com and earned All-American honors while being ranked seventh nationally at his position by Super Prep.\r\nCrable received a four-star prospect rating from Rivals100.com and was named to Prep Star's Dream Team Top 100 list, in addition to earning Parade All-American honors. He was selected to the roster of 2003 U.S. Army All-American Bowl, after he made 75 tackles, 17 sacks, three forced fumbles and two interceptions as a senior.\r\nCrable lettered three times with the varsity. He recorded 125 tackles, six sacks, 19 stops for losses and two interceptions as a junior. He also lettered four times in basketball, averaging 18 points and 10 rebounds during his junior season. A three-year letterman in track, he ran the 100-meter dash in 10.7 seconds and anchored the 4x100 relay team.\r\nIn 2003, Crable enrolled at Michigan, but spent the season on the sidelines recovering from a shoulder injury. He appeared in eight games on defense and nine contests on special teams in 2004, posting seven tackles (6 solos) with an 8-yard sack and two pass break-ups. He was listed second on the depth chart at strong-side outside linebacker in 2005, coming up with 14 tackles (12 solos), three sacks and a trio of deflected passes while appearing in 12 games.\r\nAs a junior, Crable took over strong-side linebacker chores, starting eight of 13 contests. He earned All-Big Ten Conference second-team honors from the league's coaches, going on to register 37 tackles (28 solos), 4.5 sacks and 10.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He recovered a fumble, caused two others and deflected three passes.\r\nDuring 2007 preseason camp, Crable was named one of the team's three captains. When he found out his teammates had voted him defensive captain, he immediately starting asking questions and sought advice from family and close friends. \"I was kind of nervous,\" he said. \"I called my brother, I called my best friend, I talked to my girl, I just asked a lot of questions about what it is to lead and what people thought it was to lead. I went and talked to coach E (defensive coordinator Ron English) because I don't think I was fully prepared. I think that's just a great honor, especially because it's voted on by your teammates, and it's not just coaches saying, 'Oh, this guy is going to be captain of this team.' \" \r\nThe All-American and All-Big Ten Conference second-team pick served as team captain in 2007. Crable started 12 times, ranking second on the team with a career-high 37 tackles (28 solos) and 7.5 sacks. He led the conference and ranked second nationally with a school season-record 28.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He also had four forced fumbles, a fumble recovery and four pressures. \"I think Shawn has taken the leadership part of his expectation very seriously,\" Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr said.\r\nIn 46 games on defense, Crable started 20 contests at strong-side linebacker. He recorded 148 tackles (101 solos), ranking tied for 10th on the school's all-time record list with 16 sacks for minus-102 yards and finishing seventh in Wolverines history with 43 stops for losses of 163 yards. He was credited with six quarterback pressures, six forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries, returning one 10 yards. He also deflected nine passes."

                "Overview": "When the former high school running back enrolled at Southern California, few expected him to finish his career as the team's record holder for receptions by a tight end. With his natural hands and excellent quickness, Fred Davis often created mismatches, especially for opposing linebackers trying to cover him on deep routes. He would be used as a wideout in multiple-WR formations, adding another dimension to the Trojans' passing attack.\r\nWith his athletic ability and emergence as a receiver, it was not surprising that he was recognized as the best tight end in college football. The 2007 recipient of the John Mackey Award, Davis averaged 14.2 yards per reception in 2007, second among the nation's tight ends. He was the first tight end since 1985 to lead Southern California in receptions (62).\r\nAt Rogers High School, Davis earned Super Prep, Prep Star and Insiders.com All-American first-team honors. He was a second-team USA Today All-USA choice and named to the Super Prep Elite 50, Prep Star Top 100 Dream Team and Tom Lemming Top 100 squads. The Super Prep All-Midwest Offensive MVP, Prep Star All-Midwest and All-Ohio selection had over 500 receiving yards, 600 rushing yards, 100 tackles and four interceptions while scoring 12 touchdowns as a wide receiver, running back, quarterback and strong safety in 2003. \r\nAs a junior, he made the Student Sports Junior All-American and All-Ohio squads while running for 1,100 yards and catching 50 passes for over 700 yards, with 26 scores on offense. He also registered 80 tackles and two interceptions on defense. On the basketball team, Davis averaged 15 points per game and also participated as a hurdler on the track team. \r\nDavis graduated a semester early from high school and enrolled at USC in the spring of 2004, where he was a reserve wide receiver and tight end as a first-year freshman. He saw action in nine games, finishing that first season with 30 yards on four catches.\r\nWhile playing mostly in reserve in all 13 games in 2005, Davis earned three starting assignments -- vs. Stanford, California and Fresno State. He finished with 13 caches for 145 yards (11.2-yard average) and two touchdowns, showing the coaching staff that he was ready to replace departed Dominique Byrd as the Trojans' starting tight end in 2006.\r\nAs a junior, Davis started 10 of 13 contests. He collected 352 yards with three touchdowns on 38 receptions (9.3-yard average). That performance earned him second-team All-Pac-10 Conference honors from The NFL Draft Report and Scout.com.\r\nIn 2007, Davis finally earned national attention. In addition to winning the Mackey Award as college's top tight end, he was USC's first All-American first-team tight end since Jim Obradovich in 1974. He is the first tight end to lead USC in receptions in a season since Joe Cormier in 1985, in receiving yardage since Hoby Brenner in 1980 and in touchdown receptions since Antoine Harris in 2000. He went on to catch a career-high 62 passes for 881 yards (14.2-yard average) and eight touchdowns while also recording a pair of tackles.\r\nIn 48 games at Southern California, Davis started 28 contests. He holds all of the school career and single-season records for tight ends, finishing with 117 receptions for 1,408 yards (12-yard average) and 13 touchdowns. He recorded a pair of solo tackles and also recovered an onside kickoff."

                "Overview": "The most decorated player in the history of the school, Dorsey continued a recent tradition of Tigers defensive linemen earning first-team All-American honors, as at least one LSU player has received that honor since the 2000 season. The defensive tackle's mantelpiece was certainly filled to capacity after the 2007 season, as the consensus All-American and Southeastern Conference Defensive Player of the Year earned several prestigious awards.\r\nDespite constant double- and triple-team coverage, along with late season knee and back problems, Dorsey continued to dominate. He extended his string of at least one tackle made in his last 30 games, and walked away with the 2007 Nagurski Award,  Lombardi Award, Outland Trophy and Lott Award, becoming the first player in school history to earn any of those postseason honors. \r\nDorsey attended East Ascension High School, where he was rated among the nation's top defensive linemen and one of the top three prospects in Louisiana. He was named a Parade All-American and rated the second-best prospect in Louisiana by Rivals.com. The Fox Sports Network South's Countdown to Signing Day \"All-South\" first-team choice was also a member of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Super Southern 100, Baton Rouge Advocate Super Dozen and New Orleans Times-Picayune's Top 20 Blue-Chip lists.\r\nThe senior defensive lineman was also named Louisiana's Class 4A Defensive Player of the Year and was a first-team Class 4A All-State pick. Despite being sidelined for three games with an ankle injury, Dorsey registered 43 tackles (16 for losses), two sacks and a forced fumble as a senior. He had a stellar junior year, making more than 100 tackles (12 for losses) and a dozen sacks.\r\nDorsey enrolled at Louisiana State in 2004, appearing in 11 games, starting three times at left defensive tackle. He posted 18 tackles (6 solos) with two stops for losses and also recovered a fumble. He was listed second on the depth chart behind Claude Wroten at left tackle in 2005, starting vs. North Texas. He finished that campaign with 28 tackles (16 solos), three sacks and four stops behind the line of scrimmage.\r\nDorsey took over the middle of the field for the Tigers, earning first-team All-American and All-Southeastern Conference honors in 2006. He started all 13 games, lining up at left tackle for four contests and had nine other starts on the right side. He totaled 64 tackles (22 solos) with three sacks and 8.5 stops for losses.\r\nThe junior seriously considered entering the 2007 NFL Draft, but decided to return to the university for his senior year, citing \"unfinished business.\" \r\nEven with the injuries in 2007, which began in fall camp with a sore hamstring, Dorsey was a battler throughout his final season. He ranked third on the team with 69 tackles (39 solos) and finished second on the squad with seven sacks and 12.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He also caused a fumble and deflected three passes.\r\nIn 51 games at Louisiana State, Dorsey started 30 times (21 at left tackle, nine at right tackle). He collected 179 tackles (83 solos) with 13.0 sacks for minus 93 yards, 27 stops for losses of 123 yards and seven quarterback pressures. He caused and recovered a fumble and also deflected four passes."

Possibly due to his groin injury, Doucet failed to show the explosion needed to gobble up the defender's cushion in 2007. He needs route refinement, as he will take soft-angle cuts and fails to sink his hips coming out of his breaks. He is an efficient pass catcher, but has become a liability as a kickoff returner, as he struggles to field the ball and lacks patience waiting for his blocks to develop. For a player purported to have \"explosive speed to be a go-to receiver,\" as most scouting reports say, he just seemed to be nothing more than a possession receiver as a senior.

Does a nice job of keeping his feet and adjusting when working along the boundary...Uses his body well to shield the ball from the defender and his size presents a nice target for the quarterback when going over the middle, as he uses his strength to adjust to the coverage...Has courage catching in a crowd and has the necessary strength and lateral quickness to fight off press coverage, using a good burst to gain separation once he's broken free from the second-level defender...Does a good job of making adjustments on fade routes...Will generally catch the ball away from his body and displays the necessary toughness and leaping ability to come down with the ball in a crowd (very competitive in the red zone)...Has only a modest second gear and doesn't always run away from quicker defenders, but is efficient at getting on top of the coverage, utilizing solid double moves...His strength lets him run through or out of tackles and is not the type that will go down easily...Displays the willingness and toughness to gain good position on defenders as a blocker and to sustain those blocks once he's engaged...Attacks aggressively to fit up and finish his blocks working along the line...Works hard to sustain his blocks and is good at taking angles and staying with his man cut-blocking in the second level.\r"

He added first-team Class 4A All-State recognition and was an honorable mention academic All-State selection. He also played in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl.\r\nDoucet showed tremendous versatility, playing quarterback, wide receiver, running back, and handled return duties. He closed out his career with 7,104 all-purpose yards and 79 touchdowns, including running for 3,592 yards on 470 carries and 52 touchdowns. As a senior, he rushed for 850 yards and passed for over 750 yards, despite suffering from a nagging hamstring injury. He accounted for 30 touchdowns that season.\r\nDoucet became the first player in 31 years to start every game as a freshman. He was a member of four postseason teams, including a state semifinal berth as a freshman and junior. A standout basketball player, he played a pivotal role in helping the Tigers win the Class 4A State Basketball Championship as a sophomore.\r\nThe flanker started three of 10 games he played in at Louisiana State in 2004. He was named to the Freshman All-Southeastern Conference squad, as he made 18 catches for 257 yards (14.3-yard average), including two touchdowns. He also had a 16-yard punt return.

He will need patient coaching to refine his route-running skills. While he has been used as a kickoff returner in the past, he lacks elusiveness (more of a one-cut runner) and the size and strength to absorb the punishment.

He might be conscious of the fact that physical defenders will usually attack him in attempts to strip the ball away...Does a good job of tracking the ball in flight and catching it with his hands extended, but will drop some easy throws when he tries to absorb it into the inside his frame...Has the valid timed speed to run under deep passes, struggles to adjust his body properly to off-target throws, especially ones at his shoestrings when on the move (better when he is in the open looking the ball in over his outside shoulder)...Lacks the size and \"sand in his pants\" to be anything more that a pest when it comes to blocking, whether in-line or in space on the cut block...Shows good courage attacking the middle of the field as a kickoff returner, but because of his lack of size and elusiveness, he will generally be taken down by the initial tackle.\r",

                "Overview": "Harry Douglas might lack the ideal bulk you look for in a receiver. That hasn't made it any easier for defenders to tackle the 5-foot-11 receiver. \r\nDouglas has blazing speed and the explosive second gear to leave his opponent grabbing at air. He started just 19 of 46 games for the Cardinals, but was extremely productive and left his mark on school and Big East record books.\r\nHis 10 100-yard receiving performances over the last two years rank tied for fifth in Big East Conference history. Douglas finished his career as the team's fifth all-time leading receiver, with 173 receptions, tied for sixth in Big East annals. His 2,924 yards receiving rank second in both school and league annals while his 15 touchdown catches rank seventh on Louisville's career chart.\r\nAt Jonesboro High School, Douglas earned first team All-County and honorable mention All-State honors as a senior.

He was also selected to the Clayton News Daily Southern Crest Super 11 squad, as he caught 40 passes for 831 yards and seven touchdowns during his final campaign.\r\nAs a junior, Douglas added All-Region recognition for his 26 catches for 487 yards and five scores. He would close out his three-year career with 80 receptions for 1,539 yards and 14 touchdowns.\r\nA three-sport athlete who also lettered in baseball and basketball, he collected All-Region honors and was a state Top 15 hoops choice by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He averaged 20.5 points, 3.0 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 3.0 steals as a senior for the fourth-ranked team in the state.\r\nDouglas enrolled at Louisville in 2003, but spent the entire season on the scout team. In 11 games as a reserve, he made five catches for 43 yards (8.6-yard average) and ran for a 65-yard touchdown in 2004. That year, he performed mostly on special teams, averaging 21.4 yards on nine kickoff returns while recording nine tackles (seven solo) and recovering a fumble.\r\nThe talented receiver started two of UL's 12 games during 2005. He finished fourth on the team with 27 catches for 457 yards (16.9-yard average) and a pair of touchdowns. He picked up 37 yards on six reverses (6.2 avg), threw one pass for an interception and returned seven kickoffs for 142 yards (20.3 avg). On special teams, he posted seven tackles (five solo).\r\nDouglas started seven games while appearing in 13 in 2006, earning All-Big East Conference first-team honors. He led the team and league in receptions (5.38 per game) and yards receiving per game (97.31 yards per game). He hauled in 70 passes for a single-season record 1,265 yards (18.1-yard average) and six touchdowns. On the ground, he ran for 49 yards on seven tries (7.0 avg), returned three punts for 16 yards, had a three-yard kickoff return and made one solo tackle.\r\nA right ankle sprain in the fourth game vs. Syracuse would sideline Douglas for two games and hamper him the rest of the season. He picked up second-team All-American and first-team All-Big East recognition, ranking 12th nationally and first in the conference with an average of 7.1 receptions per game. \r\nDouglas finished third in the nation with an average of 115.9 yards receiving per contest, as he again paced the squad with 71 catches for 1,159 yards (16.3-yard average) and seven scores, becoming just the fourth player in school history to catch 70 passes in a season twice and just the third to gain over 1,000 yards in a season twice.

But he has an explosive initial step off the snap and the quickness to take a wide loop and chase down the quarterback. He has the ability to clear his feet and move laterally down the line, good hand punch to control isolated blockers and is a good leverage player vs. the run. Like Rice, Ellis seems more concerned about getting to the quarterback than doing the \"little things\" to improve his overall game. With his foot speed, he could see action as a linebacker in a 3-4 alignment. He will need time to develop needed muscle mass and bulk to be a down lineman at the next level. Still, there are inconsistencies in his game, most notably a motor that is not always running, along with some poor judgment, both on and off the field. Virginia Tech has failed to produce NFL-quality at defensive end since Bruce Smith in 1985 (Darryl Tapp of Seattle is another on the rise), but with his athletic ability and quickness, Ellis is worth a look early in the draft even if he's not first-round material.",
                    "Negatives": "Has adequate muscle tone in his upper body and possesses, smooth straight calves and needs to add muscle...Not the most instinctive player of the field and needs to do a better job of reading blocking schemes...Just an average student and while he does well on the field, he needs several reps to retain...Needs to demonstrate better hand usage playing off blocks in a phone booth and can be absorbed and washed out of the play when he overextends and gets his hands outside the framework...Will run into an offensive lineman and fail to keep his hands active, struggling to shed...Needs to develop a stronger anchor, as he can be pushed off the ball, especially vs. double teams...Must do a better job with his plant-and-drive to redirect and change direction in attempts to close on the ball...Best when on the move, as he has good speed coming off the edge, but he needs to generate better counter moves and slip off blocks rather than try to overpower linemen in attempts to get to the quarterback...Needs to show better consistency with his pad level, as he tends to get too narrow in his base, leaving himself exposed to be pushed back...Lacks the \"sand in his pants\" to split double teams and bull rush inside...His timed speed is impressive enough for a potential move to a 3-4 strong-side linebacker, but he will need to open his hips better in his pass drops to get proper depth...Stamina is an issue, as he seems to disappear late in games...Also might have a medical red flag and teams will closely evaluate the medical reports on his right shoulder, which has twice been operated on for a torn labrum...Lacks the bulk to take on combo blocks, lacking the lower-body strength to anchor...Has active hands and good weight-room strength, but that power fails to translate to the field in the form of a jolting hand punch when he gets his hands outside his framework...More of an outside charger, as bigger blockers have had good success riding him out when redirecting in-line...Charged with disorderly conduct and obstructing justice in 2006, resulting in a one-game suspension...Has had good success deflecting passes at the line of scrimmage, but his timing is off...More of a one-move pass rusher who gets frustrated when his initial charge fails...Must show better urgency on the field, as he will generally throttle down when the action is away from him rather than pursue on the back side.\r",

                "Overview": "With a few notable exceptions, former Virginia Tech defensive ends haven't exactly taken the NFL by storm. \r\nSince Buffalo selected Bruce Smith in the 1985 draft, until Seattle discovered Darryl Tapp in the second round of the 2006 draft, few Hokies have been successful going from Blacksburg to the NFL. With his breakout 2007 season, Chris Ellis hopes that his name will be alongside Smith and Tapp in the near future.\r\nEllis is more than just an edge rusher. He has had good success as a leverage player vs. the run and has the quick-twitch moves to give chase in the opposing backfield. With his lateral agility and ability to clear his feet on the move, some scouts are even analyzing him as a potential strong-side linebacker in a 3-4 alignment, thanks to his 4.56 speed.\r\nEllis was a member of Super Prep's Elite 100 list following his senior season at Bethel High School, where he led the team with 50 tackles, seven for loss, and 10 sacks as a defensive end and outside linebacker. He was named an All-American by both Super Prep and Prep Star as a defensive lineman and received VHSCA All-Eastern Region honorable mention as a defensive end his final season.\r\nEllis was also selected as a first-team Newport News Daily Press All-Star, adding first-team Peninsula District accolades. He was ranked the 13th-best defensive end in the country and the third-best prospect in Virginia by Super Prep and rated the 21st-best defensive end in the nation by Tom Lemming on ESPN.com. An All-Mid-Atlantic Region choice by Prep Football Report, he recorded 75 tackles and 15 sacks as a junior.\r\nEllis enrolled at Virginia Tech in 2003, spending the season as a defensive end on the scout team until undergoing surgery on his right shoulder in October to repair a torn labrum. He earned third-team Freshman All-American honors from The Sporting News in 2004, lining up for 13 games as the team's top reserve at defensive end. He would finish his first season with the Hokies by making 33 tackles (15 solo) with three sacks, 7 1/2 stops for losses and 14 quarterback pressures. He also recovered two fumbles.\r\nAs a sophomore, Ellis started nine of 13 contests at right defensive end. He was in on 41 tackles, including six sacks and 10 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage, both ranking second on the team. He added 14 pressures with two forced fumbles and batted down five passes.\r\nIn 2006, Ellis started 12 games at left defensive end. He was bothered by shoulder problems at the beginning and end of the year that required surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder after the team's bowl game. He was also suspended for the Georgia Tech clash when he was arrested in October for disorderly conduct. He made 38 tackles (18 solo) with 4 1/2 sacks, 8 1/2 stops for losses and 16 pressures while also coming up with two forced fumbles.\r\nAs a senior, his relentless pressure on opposing quarterbacks earned Ellis first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference honors. He posted a career-high 53 tackles (25 solo), along with 8 1/2 sacks, nine stops behind the line of scrimmage and 38 pressures. He caused one fumble and recovered another, as he also deflected five passes and intercepted another."

Ellis probably could not carry the bulk to play a classic two-gap, but as an under-tackle he could be a clone of what Glover has done. Both rely on their quickness and ability to neutralize double teams. Both take good angles in pursuit and are move oriented types who get better penetration on the slant rather than with a blocker right over their heads. Ellis is quick to locate the ball in a crowd and uses his hands and quickness to leverage and redirect. Shooting the gaps is a specialty for him, but he is also equally effective as a wrap-up tackler. With his lateral agility and quickness, he will make a nice living creating a new line of scrimmage vs. the running game at the next level.",

                "Overview": "The Trojans' three-year starter at nose guard, Ellis was regarded as one of the top interior linemen in the country entering his senior season, and only continued to build his reputation in 2007. The winner of the Pat Tillman Pac-10 Conference Defensive Player of the Year Award, Ellis was also the recipient of the Morris Trophy, given to the league's premier lineman.\r\nMany had expected Ellis to be playing in the National Football League rather than for the Trojans in 2007. He seriously contemplated applying after his junior season, but because he missed a portion of 2006 while recovering from early season arthroscopic knee surgery, he decided to return for his final campaign. \"I think I can mature more as a football player and a person,\" Ellis said last summer. \"It's only one more year. How bad can one more year be?\"\r\nSouthern California's gain resulted in significant losses for their opposition, as no offensive lineman could contain Ellis, who registered a career-high 8.5 sacks to go along with 8.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage and seven pass deflections as a senior. After manhandling the Notre Dame offensive line in their 2007 encounter, the Irish head coach Charlie Weis told reporters, \"Ellis is on about every (award) list known to mankind. He locates the ball, uses his hands, plays with good balance. He's a tough player.\"  \r\nAt Chino High School, Ellis earned Super Prep and Prep Star All-American honors, in addition to garnering Super Prep Elite 50, Prep Star Top 100 Dream Team, The Sporting News Hot 100, Super Prep All-Farwest, Prep Star All-West, Tom Lemming All-West, Long Beach Press-Telegram Best in the West first-team and Tacoma News Tribune Western 100 honors.\r\nEllis was also named to the Orange County Register Fab 15, Cal-Hi Sports All-State, All-CIF Southern Section, All-CIF Division II first-teams and was chosen Los Angeles Times All-Star Lineman MVP. The Los Angeles Times All-Inland Empire Lineman MVP selection as a senior offensive and defensive lineman, he recorded 122 tackles (35 solo), including 19 for losses (with 6.5 sacks), plus a blocked punt, a forced fumble and a pair of fumble recoveries in 2002. \r\nAs a junior in 2001, he made the Cal-Hi Sports All-State Underclass, All-CIF Southern Section, All-CIF Division II and Los Angeles Times All-Inland Empire first-teams. He posted 108 tackles, including 16 for losses (with 10 sacks), in 2001. As a sophomore, he picked up Cal-Hi Sports All-State first-team recognition. He also competed on the school's track team in the weights.\r\nEllis enrolled at Southern California in 2003, but during fall drills he suffered a left ankle fracture and was granted a medical hardship. He played in 11 games behind All-American Mike Patterson at nose guard in 2004, but saw just limited action, making two assisted tackles.\r\nWith Patterson graduating, Ellis took over nose guard chores in 2005, starting all 13 games. He received All-Pac 10 Conference honorable mention, as he collected 50 tackles (28 solos) and ranked third on the squad with 4.5 sacks and eight stops for losses. He also deflected three passes and caused a fumble.\r\nIn 2006, Ellis earned Collegefootballnews.com All-American first-team honors, in addition to being a consensus All-Pac 10 Conference first-team choice, despite missing three games after he suffered torn cartilage in his right knee in practice prior to the Nebraska clash. He still managed to win the Pac-10 Morris Trophy (for the league's top defensive lineman, as voted by the league's offensive linemen). \r\nEllis went on to register 34 tackles (17 solos), 4.5 sacks and 8.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage in 10 contests. He also had a forced fumble, two fumble recoveries, three pass deflections and blocked a kick. USC center, Ryan Kalil, who battled vs. Ellis in practices for three years and was the offensive recipient of the 2006 Morris Trophy, raved about his former teammate, stating, \"He's an unbelievable football player. He made me so much better because I had to block him every day. He's so strong, so man-strong. He's just a good player.\"\r\nEllis was a unanimous All-American and All-Pac 10 Conference first-team choice as a senior. He was a semifinalist for the Bednarik Award (top defensive player) and Lott Trophy, in addition to being named Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year and winning the Morris Trophy for the second consecutive season. In 13 starts, he totaled 58 tackles (29 solos) and ranked second on the squad with 8.5 sacks and 12.5 stops for losses.

His balance allows him to keep his feet after initial contact and his leg drive sees him consistently push past the pile and make upfield cuts that will generally see the tackler miss...The thing you see on film is his ability to make sharp cuts when the rush lane is clogged...Picks up stunts and blitzes quickly when blocking in the backfield and has no problems digesting a complicated playbook, as he has played a variety of positions for Furman...Has a very good feel for the creases and cutback lanes, showing vision and urgency getting through trash...Has a determined nature attacking the rush lanes and while he could use a little technique refinement as a drive blocker, he has a take no prisoners approach when asked to block in pass protection...Demonstrates the ability to quickly gain advantage into the crease, showing the suddenness to make the initial tackler miss...Has the pad level to stay square through his runs and shows a fluid step on his lateral movement...One of the things that set him apart from other big backs is his ability to stay low in his pads, which allows him to generate leg drive needed to run through small seams...Sudden out of his stance and hits the holes with power consistently to clear the line of scrimmage...On 575 rushing attempts, he has been stopped for negative yardage just 15 times, totaling 22 yards in losses...Fluid strider who can accelerate to the second level and shows that pull away burst and top-end speed needed to beat the slower linebackers when operating in space... While he is more quick than fast, he shows good acceleration getting to the outside... Might not try to wiggle and shake off a defender, but with his balance and body control, he can make the sharp cuts, showing the vision to spot the cutback lanes without having to throttle down or gather...It is very rare to see him miss the cut back, as he will hit the holes, spin and bounce off tackles...If the rush lanes are clogged, he is quick to improvise, showing the instincts and vision to power his way through even the smallest of seams...Has very good inside running strength and quick feet to accelerate past trash... His vision allows for him to bounce off tackles, much like Jerome Bettis did in his prime... Is a load to bring down one-on-one and has that body lean that allows him to get good movement after the initial hit...Powerful runner inside who has the ability to carry tacklers on his back for additional yardage...Shows good field vision and is even stronger than his frame indicates...Runs at the proper pad level and is crisp making his cuts, showing balance and power to move the pile and get the tough inside yardage...Has outstanding power and balance after initial contact and has made a living out of being the best runner possible to carry the ball in goal-line or short-yardage situations (converted 93 goal-line runs for first downs during his career, including all 29 attempts in 2006)...Possesses good knee lift and bend to sidestep low tackles and consistently moves the pile while staying low in his pads... Bounces off arm tackles and when gang-tackled, ball protection is his top priority...With his upper body strength, when he carries the ball high and tight, defenders have problems trying to dislodge the ball from him...Prior to 2007, he needed to do a better job of staying on his blocks when leading through the hole and attempting to widen the rush lanes, but he refined his blocking technique as a senior,  showing good hip snap as a blocker and a strong hand jolt to push the linebackers out of the lanes, coming up with 15 touchdown-resulting blocks in his final season.\r"

Has the speed to close and make plays near the line...When he doesn't bite on pump fakes and keeps his assignments, he shows the acceleration to catch up and defend in the deep zone...As a junior, he was more efficient as a zone defender, making proper switch-offs...Adequate cut tackler when he stays low in his pads...Has the open-field quickness, fluid agility and excellent hip swerve to recover when beaten on long routes (needs to explode out of his breaks better)...Shows better stop-and-go action on short and intermediate routes than he does in the deep third of the field...Not afraid to jump and extend for the ball in tight quarters.\r"

                "Overview": "Orlando Scandrick opted to skip his senior year and enter the NFL draft. He's an unfamiliar name to some, but pro scouts are fully aware of Scandrick's ability. \r\nScandrick capably claimed the leadership role in a very young secondary after the graduation of Gerald Alexander (Detroit). With the junior left cornerback calling the defensive signals in the backfield, Boise State improved its pass defense from 45th in 2006 to rank 26th nationally in 2007. \r\nAt Los Alamitos High School, Scandrick was an all-around player, competing as a wide receiver and defensive back, in addition to returning kicks. He was named to the first-team Long Beach Dream Team, first-team All-Sunset League, and Prep Star 2004 All-American team. He was also a member of the Cal Top 100 squad selected by Rivals.com.\r\nAs a senior, Scandrick caught 52 passes for 832 yards and 12 touchdowns. On defense, he recorded 54 tackles and three interceptions that season. He also returned 22 kickoffs for 1,024 yards (league record 46.5 yards per return) and one touchdown.\r\nScandrick enrolled at Boise State in February 2005, in time to compete in spring drills. He was heavily pursued by Colorado State, Oregon, Washington State, Wyoming, Fresno State and Nevada, but felt that BSU offered him a better opportunity to start. He earned Freshman All-American honors, starting 12 games at right cornerback. He totaled 50 tackles (41 solo) with a sack and three stops for losses. He broke up 11 passes and scored on a 50-yard interception return. He also blocked two kicks vs. Hawaii, returning a blocked field goal for a touchdown.\r\nIn 2006, Scandrick switched jerseys from No. 16 to No. 8 while also switching from left cornerback to the right side, as Gerald Alexander moved to free safety. He finished fourth on the team with 52 tackles (32 solo), adding two stops, six stops for losses and a pair of forced fumbles. He deflected six passes, picked off another and blocked an extra point try that he returned for a defensive score.\r\nAs a junior, Scandrick started all 13 games at left cornerback. He produced 50 tackles (36 solos) with three stops behind the line of scrimmage and caused two fumbles. He had two interceptions and seven pass break-ups. He gained 54 yards on two punt returns and 78 yards on four kickoff returns (19.5-yard average). He also set a school record with four blocked kicks.\r\nScandrick started 38 of 39 games he played in at Boise State. He recorded 152 tackles (109 solo) with 3.5 sacks for minus-24 yards and 12.5 stops for losses of 70 yards. He caused five fumbles and recovered another for a score. He deflected 24 passes and gained 117 yards on four interceptions, including one that was returned for a touchdown. He blocked seven kicks, returned four punts for 78 yards (19.5-yard average), had two blocked punt returns for 54 yards and recovered a blocked extra point try for a defensive score."

He has good eyes for tracking the ball in flight and, while he prefers to attack the ball better than play in off coverage, he showed in 2007 that he is capable of creating problems for receivers trying to get into their routes. In his only season as a full-time cornerback, opposing passers completed just 35 percent of their tosses into his area (21 of 60) and he has never allowed a touchdown reception. He could also be an adequate fill-in on returns, but is not good enough to make a decent living handling those chores. Still, it adds to his resume, as he relishes being used in a variety of roles.

He started that season at \"field\" cornerback, shifted to \"boundary\" cornerback for the third game and spent the rest of the year calling defensive signals for the defensive backfield at strong safety.\r\nSmith was also used as the team's punt returner, as the coaches experimented using him as a wide receiver during his 2006 campaign. The 2007 season brought about yet another change for this talented youngster, as he returned to \"field\" cornerback for the team's first 13 games. The shutdown cornerback was shut down for his final college game, missing the 2008 Fiesta Bowl due to a broken toe.\r\nPlaying a variety of roles was nothing new for Smith. During his four-year prep career at Santa Fe High School, he competed as a cornerback, running back and wide receiver.

He was a two-time All-State choice by the Daily Oklahoman, earning Oklahoma Offensive Player of the Year honors from that newspaper as a junior, after leading the team to the Class 6A championship game. A quality student, he attained a 3.4 grade point average.\r\nSmith recorded 63 tackles and intercepted six passes (two returned for touchdowns) as a senior. He also rushed the ball 122 times for 935 yards and nine touchdowns, as he also caught 47 passes for 607 yards and eight scores that season. He registered 73 tackles and nine interceptions while scoring 20 times on offense as a junior. He finished his career with 28 interceptions, as he returned two punts and two kickoffs for touchdowns and even averaged 34 yards per attempt as a punter. An Honor Roll student, Smith also lettered in basketball and track, clocking a personal best 10.8 in the 100-meter dash.\r\nSmith earned national attention during his first year at Oklahoma, starting his final 10 games at strong safety. The Freshman All-American selection delivered 47 tackles (30 solo) with two stops for losses and a fumble recovery. He broke up three passes, picked off two others and averaged 20.9 yards on 18 kickoff returns.\r\nAs a sophomore, Smith earned All-Big Twelve Conference first-team defensive accolades and honorable mention on special teams. He started the year at cornerback for three games before moving back to strong safety. He was hampered late in the year by a left knee sprain that he suffered vs. Iowa State. He still ranked sixth on the team with 41 tackles (30 solo), adding 3.5 stops for losses and a fumble recovery. \r\nSmith returned one of three interceptions for a score and deflected eight passes. He saw some action on offense, coming up with a 12-yard catch and handled both return duties, averaging 22.6 yards on 12 kickoff returns and 7.8 yards with a touchdown on 37 punt returns.\r\nSmith earned consensus All-Big Twelve Conference first-team recognition in 2007. He started the team's first 13 games at \"field\" cornerback, ranking fourth on the squad with 78 tackles (57 solo).

                "Overview": "Because of his impressive balance and lateral agility, some teams are looking at Thompson as a potential linebacker candidate at the next level. Not known for his pass rushing skills most of his career, he enjoyed success at attacking the pocket as a senior, producing 6.5 of his career 8.5 sacks during his final campaign.\r\nDescribed by Wake Forest defensive ends coach as a \"Julius Peppers-type player\" coming out of Charlotte Christian High School, Thompson never lived up to that billing for the Demon Deacons. Still, he provided the team with a physical run stuffer with good strength at the point of attack. \r\nAt Charlotte Christian, Thompson was ranked 40th nationally at the defensive end position by Rivals.com and ranked 19th among North Carolina prospects. He was listed as the country's 37th-best defensive end by TheInsiders.com and also ranked 90th on the \"Atlantic Hot 100\" by the same publication.\r\nAs a true freshman at Wake Forest in 2004, Thompson started three of 11 games he appeared in at right defensive end. He delivered 15 tackles (8 solos) with a sack and three stops for losses. He also intercepted one pass and deflected another.\r\nA left knee anterior cruciate ligament tear cost Thompson the final three games of the 2005 season. Starting the first eight contests at right end, he posted 21 tackles (15 solos) with two stops behind the line of scrimmage and a pass break-up.\r\nThompson appeared in 14 games at right defensive end in 2006, but started just eight contests due to a shoulder contusion suffered in a late November battle with Maryland. He came up with 30 tackles (15 solos), a sack and 4.5 stops for losses. He broke up three passes and had the highlight of his career with an 86-yard interception return for a touchdown vs. Connecticut.\r\nOne of 10 finalists for the National Sportsmanship Award, given to the college player who best personifies the spirit of sportsmanship, Thompson led the team with 6.5 sacks and ranked second on the squad with 11 stops behind the line of scrimmage as a senior. He finished sixth on the team with 46 tackles (35 solos), as he also caused two fumbles and broke up three passes."

If he can ever develop better timing and better hands, he could be a dominant pass thief.

                    "Negatives": "Has a lean frame that will need to carry more bulk to compete vs. the physicality of the pro game...Good program performer, but needs structure in the offseason and must develop better training habits...Generally quiet player off the field, but does get a bit too cocky and vocal on the field, leading to unnecessary penalties...Has excellent leaping ability, but needs to time his jumps better, as he is too inconsistent getting to the pass at its high point...Struggles to retain plays and digest a complicated playbook, needing more than a few reps to understand his assignment...Good wrap-up tackler, but shows little to no pop behind his hits, which sees bigger backs easily bounce off his tackles...Will bite on play-action, but has shown improvement in not being fooled by a receiver's double moves...Easily engulfed when trying to lend run support at the line, as he lacks the hand technique or power to shed...Aggressive cut tackler, but does not have the strength to just drag down the ballcarrier...Traps the ball rather than extending to pluck outside his frame and this has resulted in at least a half dozen of potential interceptions becoming merely pass deflections in 2007...Needs to show better work ethic in his approach to classroom and playbook study (not a student of the game).\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a lean frame, but shows good muscle tone and has room to add at least another 10 pounds of bulk without having it affect his impressive timed speed...Is much quicker reading routes than recognizing run plays, showing good urgency closing on the ball...Rare to see him get taken out of position when playing in man coverage...Shows good foot quickness and flexibility, demonstrating the acceleration and second gear to get back on the route when a receiver gets behind him...Has enough of a hand punch to generate good press coverage, but also has the balance and change of direction agility to play in off coverage...Can stay on the hip and run with most receivers...Comes out of his breaks with good suddenness, opening his hips smoothly coming out of his backpedal...Rare to see him take any false steps in transition, showing good weight distribution and loose hips to turn and go after the thrown pass...Can even be effective using a shuffle-and-bail technique...Has a good feel for the routes developing, playing his man tight while showing proper body adjustments on the move...Got better breaks on the ball as a senior than he did in the past, but gets into trouble when he eyeballs the backfield too long...Has the speed and burst to make plays at the opposite side of the field and takes good angles to close...Can cover a lot of ground with his sudden burst...Adjusting to runners in support is a concern, as he struggles to play off blocks, but has good wrap-up technique to hang on to the ballcarrier until help arrives...Gets himself into position to make plays on the ball, but does not show natural hands (will trap) and must improve his timing when elevating for the ball...Lacks the sand in his pants to be an impact tackler, but shows willingness coming inside the box on run plays...Good second effort tackler (more of a pester type), who might bounce off a few bigger receivers, but he will not hesitate to face up or attempt to drag down when working in space...Not used often as a kickoff returner, but has that explosive burst and good ball security to get big yardage when running back the ball...Even though he lacks natural hands for the interception, he is good at reaching around and knocking balls out of the hands of the receiver...Ballcarriers have had good success running over him, so he has now developed good cut tackling skills, getting low in his pads to attack the opponent's feet.\r"

                "Overview": "The former junior college transfer instantly became ASU's top cover cornerback, starting all 26 games during his two seasons with the Sun Devils. He proved to be an effective run support defender who simply loved the challenge of taking on receivers much bigger than him. In 2007, his main pass coverage assignments featured four receivers who stood at least 6-feet-4 and five who were 220 pounds or more. \r\nThe 5-9 cornerback allowed the opposition to complete just 31.13 percent of the passes thrown into his area during his final campaign (33-of-106). Tryon was just as capable of covering the top receiver on deep routes, but also excelled in press coverage, rerouting his man away from 54 potential catches, in addition to breaking up or intercepting 19 other throws. He allowed a miniscule 3.74 yards per pass attempt vs. him as a senior.\r\nAt Taft High School, Tryon earned second-team All-City honors as a running back, gaining 1,435 yards and scored 21 touchdowns in 2002. He also registered a 96-yard kickoff return vs. Jefferson High. He earned All-American, All-State and All-City accolades in track-and-field as a senior, as he clocked 10.6 seconds in the 100-meters, 21.2 in the 200-meters and 47.25  in the 400-meters (fastest time in the state).\r\nTryon attended San Joaquin Delta College after graduating from Taft, but did not play football in 2003. He then enrolled at the College of the Canyons in 2004, earning second-team All-Western States Conference honors while starting all 14 games at cornerback. He helped the team capture the 2004 National Championship, the state of California Championship and the Western States Conference Championship.\r\nAs a sophomore, Tryon earned second-team All-American accolades. He was selected to the All-State team in addition to earning first-team All-Western States Conference honors. Super Prep rated him the 18th-best player in the junior college ranks.\r\nTryon was an All-Pac 10 Conference honorable mention in his first season at Arizona State in 2006. He took over right cornerback duties, ranking fourth on the squad with 47 tackles (37 solos), including a sack and 2.5 stops for losses. He recovered two fumbles, broke up seven passes and picked off another. He also averaged 41.2 yards on five kickoff returns.\r\nAs a senior, Tryon earned All-American third-team honors from The NFL Draft Report and was an All-Pac 10 Conference second-team choice by the media. Named the team's Most Improved Defensive Player, he started all 13 games at right cornerback, as he ranked fifth on the team with 56 tackles (43 solos). \r\nHe caused a fumble and led the team with 16 pass deflections. He also had three interceptions, returning one for a touchdown and returned seven kickoffs for a 23.7-yard average. His total of 19 passes defended ranked 11th in the nation."

He is a versatile, instinctive linebacker with good discipline on the field, but is best when making plays in front of him. He gets engulfed by bigger blockers too much and does not have pass rush skills to be an efficient edge rusher. He is more of a drag-down type of tackler than one who will wrap, but his lack of natural hands and his hip stiffness make him a bit of a liability in man coverage. He's struggled to maintain weight in the past and marginal pass coverage skills prevent him from moving to safety. Late in the draft, he is worth a look because of his outside run ability and could develop into a nice addition for the sub package and special-team coverage units.",

Must do a better job of flipping his hips to get a cleaner break in transition...Does not show the timing or natural hands to deflect or pick off many passes in coverage... Even though he has a lot of tackles, he is not a classic wrap-up tackler and does not show much explosion behind his hits (more of a drag-down type with adequate collision strength)...Rarely faced top-level competition.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a lean, yet athletic-looking frame with large hands, defined chest and shoulders and developing thighs and calves...Makes up for a lack of ideal size and bulk with very good instincts, as he is always around the ball and almost never bites on play action or misdirection...Generally durable athlete, but will play with pain...Undersized linebacker, but has adequate timed speed and outstanding productivity...Has good all-around athletic ability, agility, balance and body control...Has good acceleration to the ball and uses his experience as a prep quarterback to quickly read hats and react to the quarterback's movement...Overall strength is an issue, but he can make up for it with rapid acceleration to the ball, staying low in his pads with arms extended to drag down and latch on as a tackler...Displays good mental alertness, as he is the type who reads and reacts quickly with good instincts...Makes all the defensive calls and can adjust on the field, whether at weak side or middle linebacker...Exhibits good character on the field and in the locker room...Coachable, well-liked guy and highly respected by all, as he is a good team leader who leads by example and is also outspoken...Demonstrates quick instincts and good discipline as a player, as he is quick to read and react to the run or pass...Is good flowing down the line, as he has the functional lateral movement, taking good angles to close on the ball with urgency...Runs well through traffic, accelerates with a burst and plays with effort taking on outside running plays...Generally effective in space or in the hole, as he is good at colliding with the opponent and rarely misses a tackle...Undersized and won't make much impact vs. inside runs at the next level, but is a good fit for the weak-side, as he is quick to scrape through traffic, avoiding or slipping blocks to make a tackle or squeeze the hole...Plays strong at the point of attack on outside runs to him and is very effective on plays away from him with good speed and effort to give chase down the sidelines (will be a step behind on long pursuit to the opposite hash, as he has too much hip stiffness to fly to the ball suddenly)...His lack of playing strength works against him, but he uses his hands well to defeat cut blocks and seldom stays blocked for long... Displays good use of his hands to protect himself and shed blockers, but doesn't overpower lineman...Not a pass rusher, but does flash the ability to be disruptive with speed and football instincts...In the zone he is alert to threats, as he gets deep quickly, reads the quarterback well, anticipates and reacts quickly and drives on the ball or receiver...In man coverage, he is able to stay snug to a running back, cover wheel routes downfield and run with tight ends in trail coverage...Effective breaking down in space and is alert to handling his switch-off assignment in the short zone...Has the straight-line acceleration and desire to be an effective gunner on special teams.\r"

He started most of his career (29 games) at weak-side linebacker, but with his vision and ball awareness, the two-time team captain and Most Valuable Player has also filled in capably at middle linebacker (started four games).\r\nAt Winston Churchill High School, Vobora served as team captain as a junior and senior, competing as a linebacker, safety, tight end, quarterback and running back during his three-year career. He was an honorable mention All-Midwestern League quarterback as a senior, adding second-team All-Conference accolades as linebacker his junior year. He was also an honorable mention All-Conference linebacker as a sophomore. He added two letters in basketball, earning honorable mention All-Conference as a senior. He garnered National Honor Society recognition and was a Leadership representative.\r\nAs a senior, Vobora played inside linebacker and strong safety while performing double duty on offense as the quarterback for the first half of the year and running back for the latter half. In the past, the Lancers used Vobora at tight end, wide receiver and free safety.\r\nVobora, whose father, Andy, was a linebacker at the University of Oregon, decided to enroll at Idaho rather than attend his father's alma mater. As a true freshman, Vobora appeared in 12 games, starting three contests at weak-side outside linebacker, sharing the position with Robert Davis. He finished his first season totaling 17 tackles (12 solo). In 2005, Vobora started six contests at weak-side linebacker. He was limited late in the season by a shoulder problem, but still ranked sixth on the squad with 42 tackles (27 solo), including five stops for losses, as he caused three fumbles and recovered two others.\r\nAs a junior, Vobora earned All-Western Athletic Conference first-team accolades. The team captain and MVP finished seventh nationally with 11.17 tackles per game and also ranked tied for 22nd in the nation with 16.5 stops for losses, the most by a Vandal since Idaho joined the WAC. He registered 134 tackles (84 solo), the eighth-best season total in school history. He added two sacks with a pair of pressures and caused two fumbles. He also picked off a pass and broke up two others.\r\nIn 2007, Vobora garnered All-American honorable mention, All-WAC first-team honors and team MVP recognition. He started ten games at weak-side linebacker and two others in the middle. He was limited in fall camp with a shoulder contusion, getting off to a slow start with just four hits vs. Southern California in the season opener before going on a tear that saw him register at least 10 tackles in 10 of his next 11 games.\r\nVobora's 148 tackles (86 solo) in 2007 rank second on the school single-season list. He had one sack with two pressures, as he caused and recovered a fumble. He also broke up a pass and intercepted another.\r\nIn 45 games at Idaho, Vobora started 33 contests. He ranks sixth in school history with 341 tackles (209 solo), including three sacks for minus-22 yards, 28 stops for losses of 94 yards and four quarterback pressures. He recovered three fumbles and caused six others. He also intercepted two passes and had five pass deflections. He registered at least 10 tackles in 17-of 24 games over his last two seasons with the Vandals."

He spent three seasons competing as a wide receiver and running back for head coach John Causey.\r\nUpon graduation, he enrolled at Butler County (Kan.) Community College. He red-shirted in 2003, taking over right cornerback chores the following season. In 10 regular season games, he posted 44 tackles (23 solos) with seven pass deflections and ranked among the nation's leaders with a Kansas Jayhawk Football Conference-leading five interceptions. He earned National Junior College All-American team and All-Conference first-team accolades that season.\r\nWilhite transferred to Auburn in 2005. He took over right cornerback chores for the final seven games of the season, coming up with a career-high 47 tackles (35 solos). He also broke up seven passes and intercepted another. He missed three games in 2006, but started the 10 that he played in, finishing with 24 tackles (20 solos), five pass break-ups and a forced fumble. But, he was hampered by a nagging right hamstring pull and later missed the Cotton Bowl with a right knee meniscus tear.\r\nA left shoulder injury limited Wilhite during 2007 spring camp and lingering hamstring issues limited him to six starting assignments -- two at right cornerback and four at nickel back.

He also gained 378 rushing yards with four touchdowns, adding another score on a reception. He played safety as a sophomore and also lettered in baseball, batting .430 during his senior campaign.\r\nIn 2003, Williams turned down scholarship offers from Miami, Nebraska, Notre Dame and UCLA to enroll at Southern California. He spent the season performing on the scout team and in 2004, he appeared in 13 games as the backup to Dallas Sartz at strong-side outside linebacker. He finished with 14 tackles (eight solo), a sack and two stops for losses and was the recipient of the team's John McKay Award (given to the underclassman with the most competitive spirit.\r\nAs a sophomore, Williams played a key role for the Trojans, serving as the backup on the strong side for USC's first two games before he took over the starting job for the next six contests (Oregon, Arizona State, Arizona, Notre Dame, Washington and Washington State). He then switched to the starting inside linebacker job for the Stanford and California games, but sprained his left kneecap at California and was sidelined for the Trojans' final three contests (Fresno State, UCLA and Texas). Williams would post 29 tackles (10 solo) with a sack, four stops for losses and a forced fumble.

He did not get a chance to carry the ball, but delivered 18 tackles (14 solo) with a sack, a forced fumble and also had an interception.\r\nWilliams' versatility was greatly appreciated by the coaching staff in 2007, when injuries depleted the linebacker unit. He appeared in all 13 games, earning starts at strong-side linebacker vs. Washington, Stanford and Arizona and then started at middle linebacker vs. Notre Dame. He was an All-Pac-10 Conference honorable mention and won USC's Most Inspirational Player Award and Co-Special Teams Player of the Year Award.\r\nHe went on to post a career-high 56 tackles (37 solo) with five stops for losses, as he also had an interception and five pass break-ups."

                    "Negatives": "Consistency and concentration have been very inconsistent throughout his career...Has good knee bend, but would be more effective working down the line if he played at a lower pad level, as his high stance and adequate hand usage has allowed blockers to gett to his jersey, latch on and control...Played with better urgency as a senior, but does go through long concentration lapses and is not the type that will get involved in plays away from his territory (has the range, but it is rare to see him downfield)...Struggled with academics throughout his career and, due to a combination of marginal instincts and adequate intelligence, he will struggle to digest a playbook or play in a complicated scheme...Has very good timed speed, but until his senior year, he failed to generate much explosion coming off the snap...Needs to show quick-twitch moves, as he will generally look lost or disinterested in his rolling start off the snap...Lacks a good feel for blocking pressure and is not quick making reads, but will close quickly when he does locate the ball...Needs to sink his weight better and take a lower charge off the snap, as he can be pushed back on his heels when he gets too tall and narrows his base...Gets taken down to the ground too much, due to poor hand usage, as he does not use them well to keep blockers away from his body despite his long reach...Needs to translate that weight-room strength to the playing field with a stronger hand punch...Responds better to patient coaching than a hard approach... When he narrows his base, he fails to anchor and the result is minimal success combating double teams...With his long reach, he needs to show better timing getting his hands up at the line of scrimmage to deflect passes...Best playing in tight quarters, as he looks sluggish trying to chase down open-field plays (also leaves his feet at times to try to make the tackle).\r",

The following season, he would go on to earn All-State honors, prompting a fierce recruiting war for his services.\r\nWith his perfect blend of size, speed and agility, Moore is a strong, quick defensive tackle who can tie up the interior of the line. The two-year starter struggled early in his collegiate career, but since the 2006 season, he slowly developed into one of the more feared interior linemen in the Atlantic Coast Conference ranks. \r\nAn avid weightlifter, Moore posted the third-highest strength index (a measure of pound-for-pound strength) on the team in the spring of 2006 and the highest strength index in spring 2007 testing. An \"Iron Terp\" in each of his last four springs, his 365-pound power clean in 2005 was a school record for defensive linemen (broken by Dean Muhtadi in 2007).\r\nIn his lone season playing varsity football at Independence High School, Moore was one of four All-State performers on a team that featured National Player of the Year quarterback Chris Leak (Florida). Moore registered 107 tackles (69 solo), 12 stops for losses and three sacks. He was a first-team All-State selection by the Associated Press, adding All-Conference, All-County and All-District for the Patriots and was invited to play in the Shrine Bowl (North Carolina all-stars vs. South Carolina all-stars). His team went 13-0 and beat its opponents by an average score of 51-8 en route to the state championship.\r\nMoore enrolled at Maryland in 2003, spending the year on the scout team after turning down scholarship offers from North Carolina, East Carolina, Wake Forest and Duke. He saw action as a reserve defensive tackle in the final eight games of the 2004 season, making 12 tackles (six solo) with a sack and three pressures. \r\nIn 2005, Moore appeared in 10 games, starting the final three contests at weak-side defensive tackle. He posted 18 tackles (eight solo) with a stop behind the line of scrimmage, after recovering from early season right ankle woes that forced him to sit out the Temple clash.\r\nAs a junior, Moore started 10 games, including seven at weak-side tackle and three at nose guard. He was in on 47 tackles (23 solo), 3.5 sacks and 7.5 stops for losses. He had four pressures with a forced fumble and also deflected one pass.\r\nMoore's play elevated his senior year, garnering All-Atlantic Coast Conference first-team honors. He recorded 63 tackles (26 solo) with six sacks and 8.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He also picked off a pass, batted away another and caused two fumbles while starting all thirteen contests at weak-side tackle."

He is a physical receiver, but seemed to revert to body catching rather than extending for the ball as a junior. His turf toe injury probably affected his leaping ability, but even before the injury he was not firing on all eight cylinders. When his head is in the game, he is a classic chain-mover, especially inside the red zone. However, if he doesn't get his fair amount of touches, he gets frustrated, gets into penalty trouble and simply disappears for long stretches. He is certainly a player who needed to return to school to repair his tarnished image.",
                    "Negatives": "Has good agility, but appears a little stiff in his hips as he needs to sink them better coming out of his breaks...Needs to be a little softer in his angle cuts...Has decent acceleration, but is not light on his feet...Shows good body control and has the flexibility to adjust to the ball, but just needs to show better consistency...Will gather and round his cuts, at times, but has the body control to steadily improve his timing...While his hands appear natural, he can drop the easy passes due to a lack of concentration, and for some reason he did not show the arm extension that he showed in the past as a junior, as he seemed to get into a rhythm where he body-caught, rather than reach for the ball, resulting in a high amount of dropped tosses...Must work on refining his patterns, as he did not run crisp routes as a junior (perhaps compensating for turf toe) that he showed in 2006 and this caused him to have some separation issues in the open field...Needs to mature on the field, as he got very frustrated after a bad play in 2007, letting his emotions get the best of him, resulting in several penalty flags tossed his way...Will never have the speed or second gear to elude, and must return to the weight room to improve his overall strength or he will have problems defeating the jam at the next level (does not have the hand strength to jolt a press coverage defender)...Trapped the ball too often in 2007, as he seemed be using his body more as a crutch rather than displaying the natural arm reach to get to the ball at its high point (could be the result of having too much pain trying to push off with his injured foot. He did show decent extension for the ball his first two years, but reverted to body catching as a junior)...Needs to develop a better team concept, as he feels that he should be the focal point of the passing game and will throttle down or sulk when not involved in the play...Not a hard worker and needs to be monitored in the training program (tends to get out of shape and lazy in the offseason)... Does not take well to hard coaching.\r",

Shows good timing going up for the ball in flight and a competitive nature to wrest the ball away from the defenders in traffic...Extends his arms properly and catches with his hands and has the functional strength to escape press coverage...Physical blocker who will face up with aggression...Competes for the ball in traffic and is not afraid to block upfield...Makes a good effort to position and pester the defender...Capable of making the crack block upfield, showing good aggression at the second level to clear the way for the run...Not really sudden in his moves, but once he escapes the press and has that stride to get to the ball in a hurry, taking advantage of his height and long arms...Smooth in his burst and can make proper body adjustments to elude at the second level...Knows how to use his size to power through arm tackles...Effective on screens, as he can use some shake to make defenders miss and is effective at coming back for the underneath and off-target passes... Knows how to shield the ball from defenders and has the leg drive to power through the pile, along with good body lean to fall forward after the initial hit to gain additional yardage...Might lack explosive or sudden bursts off the snap, but with his long limbs he is a long-strider who can gobble up the cushion quickly...Has large, strong hands to field the ball cleanly and secures it well before turning upfield...Not really a deep threat, but his size and balance going up for the ball in a crowd makes him a legitimate red zone threat.\r"

                "Overview": "After a banner 2006 campaign that saw Urrutia haul in 58 passes and average 16.8 yards per reception, the Louisville receiver seriously considered entering the 2007 NFL Draft, but decided to return to school. \"I think I've got a lot more to work on,\" he said at the time of his decision. \"So more than likely, I'll be coming back.\"\r\nThat is what made his decision to depart after his junior year and apply for the 2008 draft a big surprise. Urrutia suffered through a nagging turf toe injury that cost him two games of action and limited him to just four starts. He also was benched for inconsistent play, as he had a rash of dropped balls and that frustration boiled over to several personal foul penalties that forced the coaching staff to keep their valuable offensive weapon on the sidelines through a disappointing season for the Cardinals.\r\nUrrutia managed only 35 receptions in his final season at Louisville. He cited his injury as a major reason for his decision to leave the university. \"It's by far the toughest decision I've ever made,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, with missing time this season and playing injured I got to see football from a different perspective. You only have so much time to play this sport, and the 2008 draft is my opportunity.\" Head coach Steve Kragthorpe said he was \"disappointed\" in Urrutia's decision, adding he thought the receiver would have benefited from returning for his senior year.\r\nUrrutia was one of the most highly sought recruits in the state of Kentucky coming out of Fern Creek High School. The two-time All-District performer was an Associated Press first- team All-State selection and named to the Courier-Journal All-State team. He was picked as one of the top 22 players in the state by the Lexington-Herald Leader and earned Nike All-American honorable mention.\r\nAs a senior, Urrutia caught 65 passes for 1,159 yards and 13 touchdowns. The team captain was also named the squad's Offensive Player of the Year and won the \"Our Boy Award\" for being the team's top senior. He also grabbed 63 receptions for 1,054 yards and 11 scores as a junior.\r\nUrrutia was an instant hit upon his arrival at Louisville in 2005. He was named Freshman All-American by The Sporting News and received second-team All-Big East Conference honors. He started seven of 11 games at the \"X\" receiver position, hauling in 37 passes for 797 yards (21.5 avg) and seven touchdowns. \r\nUrrutia again garnered All-Big East second-team accolades as a sophomore. He started all but the Kansas State contest, finishing second on the team with 58 grabs for 973 yards (16.8 avg), as he scored six times. He also recorded a solo tackle.\r\nAs a junior, Urrutia struggled throughout the season, mostly due to his injury woes, but also because of poor concentration that led to a high amount of dropped balls. He made 35 catches for 501 yards (14.3 avg), finding the end zone just three times in 10 games that included four starts.\r\nUrrutia started 23 of 34 games at Louisville, coming up with 130 receptions for 2,271 yards (17.5 avg). Sixteen of his catches were good for touchdowns, as he also recorded one solo tackle."

                    "Compares To": "EDGERRIN JAMES-Arizona...Like James, Forte' might lack explosive speed, but his lower body strength, balance and body control allow him to shift his weight, sink his pads and drive through arm tackles. He is an efficient receiver out of the backfield and adds to his resume as a gunner on special teams. Like James, he quietly goes about his job and is slowly developing into a solid cut blocker.

                "Overview": "The Green Wave boasts one of the elite tailbacks in college football. Much like his predecessor, Mewelde Moore (2000-03), Forte' is a multi-talented athlete who must be accounted for by the opposition, as he can break free for a long run, take the ball up the middle for tough yardage, catch the ball coming out of the backfield, deliver the big tackle on the special teams coverage unit or utilize his strong arm to complete the option pass.\r\nA creative open-field runner, Forte' has drawn comparisons to Arizona Cardinals standout Edgerrin James, as he shows the same balance, body control and burst to gain valid yardage after the initial hit. He ranks second on the school's career-record lists with 808 rushing attempts for 4,145 yards on the ground, while his 38 scoring runs established the Tulane all-time record. Forte' also became the 11th player in NCAA Subdivision (1-A) history to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season during his senior year.\r\nAfter leading the nation in rushing for a good part of 2007, Forte eventually finished second with 177.3 yards per game. He was also second in scoring with 11.67 points per game and fourth with 201.7 all-purpose yards per game. His five 200-yard games tied the single-season NCAA record held by three players (Marcus Allen of Southern California in 1981, Barry Sanders of Oklahoma State in 1988 and Jamario Thomas of North Texas State in 2004).\r\nIn 2007, Forte' gained 620 yards in a two-game span (vs. Southern Methodist and Memphis), the most by a Division 1-A runner since Ricky Williams of Texas gained 668 yards in 1998 (318 vs. Rice and 350 vs. Iowa State). His 2007 three-game span of 829 yards (vs. Southern Methodist, Memphis and Alabama-Birmingham) are the most gained by a Division 1-A runner in three consecutive contests since Sanders totaled 937 yards in 1988. His four-game streak of 1,031 yards (vs. Southern Methodist, Memphis, Alabama-Birmingham and Army) is the most in Division 1-A history since Sanders piled up 1,152 yards in 1988.\r\nAn Honor Roll student at Slidell High School, Forte' earned The St. Tammany Parish Player of the Year Award and was named District 5-5A Offensive Most Valuable Player as a senior. The All-Metro selection added second-team All-State honors his final year and was a two-time All-District and All-Parish choice. He also served as team captain and garnered squad MVP honors his senior season.\r\nForte' amassed 2,432 rushing yards and 31 touchdowns in his career while also catching 48 passes for 618 yards and five scores. He gained 1,375 yards as a senior while averaging 6.7 yards per carry, scoring 23 touchdowns on the ground. He also made 18 catches for 253 yards and a pair of scores. He totaled 1,057 rushing yards with eight touchdowns and caught 30 passes for 365 yards and three scores as a junior. He also lettered in track. \r\nForte' became the third member of his family to play college football and the second to suit up for Tulane. His father, Gene Forte' played for the team from 1975-77, serving as team captain as a senior. His brother, Bryan Forte', played football at McNeese State in 2004, where he competed as a reserve linebacker, recording 20 tackles (12 solos) with 3.5 stops for losses, two fumble recoveries and a forced fumble.\r\nThe talented youngster made an immediate impact during his first season at Tulane, earning Conference USA All-Freshman Team honors. He shared tailback duties with Jovon Jackson, starting the team's final three games. He finished second on the team with 624 yards and four touchdowns on 140 carries (4.5 avg). He added 180 yards and a pair of scores on 20 receptions (9.0 avg) and gained 804 all-purpose yards. He also registered three solo tackles on the punt coverage unit.\r\nForte' and Jackson would again share the brunt of the rushing load in 2005. Forte' would go on to lead the team with 169 attempts for 655 yards (3.9 avg) and four touchdowns, as he started the first four and final two contests. He ranked fifth on the Green Wave with 23 catches for 163 yards (7.1 avg) and a score, finishing with 818 all-purpose yards.\r\nForte' received All-Conference USA third-team honors and was named to the Louisiana Sports Writers Association All-State second-team in 2006. He started the first nine games, but suffered a torn meniscus and posterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, missing the Green Wave's final three contests. He still led the team in rushing with 163 rushes for 859 yards (5.3 avg) and eight touchdowns. The team's fourth-leading receiver caught 28 passes for 360 yards (12.9 avg) and two scores. He attempted one pass, recovered an onside kickoff and recorded seven tackles on special teams. He totaled 1,219 all-purpose yards, ranking third in the conference with an average of 135.44 yards per game.\r\nHeld out of spring drills as he continued to recover from his knee injury, Forte' was primed for a banner senior campaign and certainly surpassed even the wildest of expectations. He reeled off five 200-yard efforts, including four in a row, with two of those performances compiling at least 300 yards. \r\nHe rushed 361 times for 2,127 yards and a school season-record 23 touchdowns. He added 32 receptions for 282 yards and returned one kickoff 11 yards. He completed one of 10 passes for four yards.\r\nIn 43 career games, Forte' started 30 times. He finished as Tulane's career leader with 99.2 rushing yards per game, 39 rushing touchdowns and 44 total touchdowns. He is second with 5,261 all-purpose yards, 4,265 rushing yards and 833 rushing attempts."

Opposing coaches in the Big 12 Conference praised his loose hips and ability to get good depth in his pass drops, as they labeled him the pass coverage linebacker in the league.\r\nAt Montclair High School, Bowen led his team to the 2002 New Jersey state title in Group 4 competition. He overcame an ankle injury in the semifinals, and ran for 213 yards in the championship game, as he lettered twice as a fullback and linebacker.\r\nBowen enrolled at Garden City Community College in 2003, but did not play football, concentrating on his academics. He was an All-Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference first-team selection in 2004, as he started 10 games at weak-side linebacker for the Broncbusters. He led the team with 77 tackles (57 solos), adding five sacks, a league-high 14 stops for losses and six quarterback pressures. He also recovered a fumble and caused two others.\r\nBowen transferred to Iowa State in 2005, playing in 12 games as a reserve outside linebacker. He delivered 33 tackles (19 solos), a sack, two stops behind the line of scrimmage and three pressures. He also caused one fumble.\r\nIn 2006, Bowen was named All-Big 12 Conference first-team, as he registered a league-high 155 tackles (95 solos), the sixth-best season total in school history (also ranks fifth in conference season annals). He added one sack and five stops for losses. He picked off two passes, deflected three others and also caused and recovered a fumble.\r\nEven though he failed to come close to his 2006 totals, Bowen actually had a more dominant season in 2007, again garnering All-Big 12 Conference first-team honors. He led the squad and ranked sixth in the league with 99 tackles (67 solos), adding two sacks and 12.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He caused five fumbles, recovered another, broke up two passes and had one interception.\r\nIn 36 games at Iowa State, Bowen started 24 contests at weak-side outside linebacker. He delivered 287 tackles (181 solos) with four sacks for minus-32 yards and 19.5 stops for losses totaling 71 yards. He added seven quarterback pressures with seven forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries. He gained 22 yards on three interceptions and deflected five passes."

Garcon is perhaps the best blocker in the 2008 receiver class and mauls defenders that get in his way. He gets to the ball in a crowd and dominated at his level of competition. However, he lacks good route-running ability, drifting on deep patterns. He is not sudden off the snap and will get too caught up in the battle with a press-coverage defender. Still, with patient coaching and a few years serving as an understudy, he could make his way into an NFL starting lineup.",

                "Overview": "Most college football fans might not recognize his name, but after three stellar seasons followed by a stellar performance at the NFL Combine, Garcon is garnering attention from professional teams as the draft approaches. General managers and scouts take great pride in unearthing talent late in the draft, and Garcon has the athletic ability to draw interest.\r\nEven though he played at a lower level of competition, his production was eye-opening. His 60 touchdown receptions rank second in NCAA Division III history. He also became just the sixth player in Division III annals to gain over 4,000 yards receiving (4,380) in a career.\r\nPlaying professional football wasn't a thought in Garcon's mind while attending John I. Leonard High School, where he earned two letters in football, and also competed in track and soccer. A combination of poor grades and only two less-than-spectacular seasons for the Lancers doomed his college options. He didn't play as a freshman or sophomore because he was academically ineligible.\r\nGarcon estimated he had 100 yards and one touchdown his entire junior season at Leonard High. He didn't become a starter until he was a senior. He said Syracuse, Florida Atlantic and Bethune-Cookman expressed some interest, but once his grades were ruled inadequate, they were repelled. \r\nGarcon ventured to Vermont, enrolling at Norwich University in 2004. He played in 10 games with 44 receptions for 1,017 yards (23.1-yard average) and 13 touchdowns. His average of 101.7 yards per game receiving ranked 14th in the nation.\r\nHaving read that Mount Union College had captured eight NCAA Division III titles in their last 13 seasons, Garcon contacted the coaching staff at the school and transferred in 2005. He would become the first of five players from the Florida area to play at the Ohio school over the next three years. He earned All-Ohio Athletic Conference second-team honors, as he caught 68 passes for 1,196 yards (17.6-yard average) and 16 touchdowns. He also averaged 24.1 yards on 10 kickoff returns, returning one for a score.\r\nAs a junior, Garcon was named All-OAC first-team and was the recipient of the Ed Sherman Award, given to the league's most outstanding receiver. He ranked third in the nation with 1,212 yards receiving, snaring 67 passes (18.1-yard average) and 17 touchdowns. He scored twice while averaging 15.1 yards on seven carries, completed an 18-yard pass for a touchdown and scored 114 points. He also averaged 30.2 yards on five kickoff returns and 16.3 yards on three punt returns, gaining 1,518 all-purpose yards for the year.\r\nGarcon was again a first-team All-OAC, in addition to receiving the Ed Sherman Award for the second time. In 14 contests at split end, he gained 955 yards on 67 catches (14.3-yard average) with 14 touchdowns. He picked up 61 yards and two scores on 11 carries (5.5 avg) and averaged 19.8 yards on five kickoff returns, finishing with 1,166 all-purpose yards.\r\nIn his three seasons at Mount Union, he guided the Raiders to a pair of national titles. He started 39 of 41 games for the team, setting school record with 202 receptions and 47 touchdown grabs, as his 3,363 yards receiving (16.7-yard average) rank second in Mount Union annals. He rushed 19 times for 176 yards (9.3-yard average) and four scores. He completed 1-of-2 passes for an 18-yard touchdown and returned 10 punts for 100 yards (10.0 avg). He also gained 491 yards on 20 kickoff returns (24.6 avg), including a touchdown. He recorded four tackles (three solo) and amassed 3,830 all-purpose yards."

He is a good space-eater on the front wall, but with poor pad level, inconsistent effort, injury problems and character issues, you wonder if his position coach is going to need a more patience than can be expected at the NFL level to develop Harrison.",

                "Overview": "Marcus Harrison had a trying senior season. A rare four-year starter who played a variety of roles for the Razorbacks, he suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during spring drills and medical reports indicated that he would be lost for most of the 2007 campaign. He worked hard throughout his rehabilitation and made enough progress to be listed in the projected starting lineup for the season opener.\r\nHowever, Harrison was arrested Aug. 24 and accused of having an ecstasy pill and marijuana in his vehicle when he was stopped by Fayetteville police. He was charged with one count of possession of a controlled substance. The arrest caused evaluators to be very cautious in evaluating him for the 2008 NFL Draft.\r\nThe coaching staff suspended him for the season opener, but when he returned to action, the rust from the layoff affected his play early in the year. His knee problems aren't new, as he was also hampered by torn cartilage early in 2006, followed by ankle woes later in his junior campaign. \r\nHarrison was rated as the 11th-best nose tackle in the nation by Max Emfinger as a senior at Mills High School. He was a member of the Associated Press Super Team and named to Prep Star's All-Region IX team that year. He was rated the fourth-best overall player in Arkansas and the 29th-ranked defensive tackle in the nation by Rivals.com.\r\nHarrison was also rated the 72nd-best player in the Southwest by Tom Lemming and given a three-star rating by Forrest Davis. He was Super Prep's sixth-ranked player in Arkansas. The defensive tackle recorded 40 tackles and two sacks as a junior. He also snared nine passes as a tight end. He also lettered in track, recording an 8'2\" standing broad jump and 28-inch vertical jump.\r\nOriginally signed as a part of the 2003 Arkansas signing class, Harrison spent a year at Hargrave Military Academy playing for head coach Robert Prunty. He was also recruited by Oklahoma and Tennessee. Arriving at Fayetteville, he was immediately thrust into the starting lineup in 2004, becoming the first true freshman to start a season opener for the Razorbacks since safety Greg Lasker in 1982.\r\nHarrison registered 31 tackles (22 solos) with 2.5 stops for losses and a pair of pressures from the \"Bandit\" end position that season. He recovered a fumble that he returned for a touchdown and also deflected one pass. As a sophomore, he shifted to left defensive tackle, starting nine of 11 games. He totaled 37 tackles (20 solos) withy a sack, five stops for losses and 15 quarterback pressures. He also recovered a fumble for a 25-yard return.\r\nKnee and ankle problems limited Harrison to five starts in 13 games during 2006. He also suffered a concussion in late September; injuries forced him to sit out the Alabama game. He produced 42 tackles (27 solos) with 1.5 sacks, as he added 3.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage, a fumble recovery and six pressures.\r\nAs a senior, he started 10 of 12 contests at left defensive tackle and was named to the Associated Press All-Southeastern Conference second-team. He delivered a career-high 50 tackles (34 solo), getting into the backfield long enough to post 1.5 sacks, seven stops for losses and five pressures. He also had an impressive nine pass breakups while also causing one fumble.\r\nIn 47 games at Arkansas, Harrison started 34 times. He registered 160 tackles (103 solo) with four sacks for minus-34 yards, 18 stops for losses of 59 yards and 28 quarterback pressures. He caused one fumble and recovered three others, returning two of those for a total of 43 yards and a touchdown. He also deflected 11 passes."

The Wolverines took the diminutive receiver for granted and greatly paid for it; Jackson caught three passes for 92 yards, including touchdowns of 68 and 20 yards while covered by cornerback Morgan Trent.\r\nJackson ranks fourth in school history with 17 touchdown catches, becoming the seventh player in ASU annals to catch over 100 passes (110) in a career, but he also proved to be a dangerous threat out of the backfield.\r\nJackson made the most of his limited touches. He scored twice on 11 carries, returned two of his 93 punt returns for touchdowns, averaged 16.8 yards per reception, including a 22.9-yard average as a senior, and also gained 619 yards on 35 kickoff returns. He finished his career with 3,415 all-purpose yards and, even more impressive was his 13.71-yard average per touch.\r\nBeing an unknown is nothing new for Jackson. He was not recruited by BCS programs coming out of Dunwoody High School. During his prep days, he caught 30 passes for 520 yards, including two for touchdowns as a senior. He also returned two kickoffs, as well as one punt for touchdown in 2003.\r\nIn 2004, Jackson played in 11 games as a reserve slot receiver at Appalachian State. He totaled 638 all-purpose yards on 22 kickoff returns for 394 yards (17.9-yard average) and 239 yards with a touchdown on 17 receptions (14.1 avg).

He ranked third on the team with 30 catches for 449 yards (15-yard average) and five touchdowns. He continued to handle kickoff return duties, picking up 189 yards on 11 attempts (17.2-yard average). He also amassed 245 yards on 29 punt returns (8.4 avg).\r\nPlaying both split end and slot receiver, Jackson earned second-team all-Southern Conference honors on offense and first-team recognition as a punt returner. He led the conference and ranked 14th nationally with a 12.3-yard average on 30 punt returns, tying a school record with two touchdowns. He ranked second on the squad with 33 catches, good for 470 yards (14.2-yard average) and three scores, adding 34 yards on five carries, including one touchdown. He also returned two kickoffs for 34 yards.\r\nAs a senior split end, Jackson started nine of 15 games and was again a second-team All-Southern Conference choice on offense, as he grabbed 30 passes for 688 yards, leading the league with a 22.9-yard average while scoring eight times. He rushed five times for 74 yards (14.8-yard average) and one touchdown, as he also totaled 223 yards on 34 punt returns (6.6 avg). Adding to his resume as a senior, Jackson also displayed his tackling ability, as he recorded one solo tackle and caused a fumble vs. Western Carolina.\r\nIn 55 games at Appalachian State, Jackson started 25 contests. His 110 receptions rank seventh, his 1,846 yards (16.8-yard average) rank fifth and his 17 touchdowns rank fourth on the school's career list. He carried 11 times for 113 yards (10.3-yard average) and a score. \r\nJackson's 93 punt returns for 837 yards rank third in school annals (ninth in conference history) and his two touchdown returns tied the ASU all-time record. He also scored 126 points, returned 35 kickoffs for 619 yards (17.7-yard average), recorded two solo tackles with a forced fumble and piled up 3,415 all-purpose yards."

A possible return to the right tackle spot or inside to guard will be a better fit for a player with his drive-blocking ability and strong hand punch. He struggles with his slide back in pass protection and perhaps due to his shorter-than-ideal arms, he will get his hands outside his frame and overextend. He is good on the short pull, but lacks the quickness to adjust to moving targets. He has a strong anchor taking on defenders over his head, but despite his weight-room strength, the only pop he generates on contact is when he uses his hands properly.",

Will come off some blocks early and, when he gets his hands on the outside, he will lunge when punching...Does not have the timed speed to get on defenders with quickness when trap blocking. Can open his hips and move down the line, but is just not quick enough to reach the target...Must do a better job coming back to the inside in his pass set, as he does not slide back fluid enough or keep his hands inside his frame to counter throughout the play.\r",

                "Overview": "A mainstay on the Rockets' offensive line, John Greco filled a huge void at left offensive tackle when he replaced Nick Kaczur (New England) as a sophomore. \r\nThe coaches felt that Greco was more than capable of handling that tough assignment after seeing him excel at right tackle during his first year with the team. He was so impressive in 2004 that he became the first offensive lineman to win the Norman Cohen Award, given to the team's top freshman.\r\nAt Boardman High School, Greco was named first-team All-Conference and second-team All-Region as a senior, adding second-team All-Conference honors as a junior. He helped the team share the conference championship in his junior year and the squad finished second in the conference in Greco's freshman season. He also lettered one season in basketball, the same team that produced former Toledo All-Mid American Conference center, Chris Tuminello.\r\nGreco enrolled at Toledo in 2003, performing on the scout team as an offensive tackle. That preparation period helped him take over right tackle duties in 2004. He generated 59 knockdowns with seven touchdown-resulting blocks, helping the offense rank 11th in the nation with an average of 459.2 yards per game.\r\nAs a sophomore, Greco took over left tackle duties. The explosive Toledo offense ranked 10th nationally in scoring (35.8 points per game) and with their new left tackle leading the way, the rushing attack ranked 13th in the country, averaging 216.8 yards per game, a vast improvement over the previous season, when the Rockets averaged 160.8 yards per game on the ground. Greco finished that season with 86 knockdowns and 10 touchdown-resulting blocks, earning All-Mid American first-team accolades.\r\nGreco picked up All-MAC first-team honors in 2006. The team co-captain registered 90 knockdowns and came up with ten touchdown-resulting blocks. He allowed three sacks on 386 pass plays and guided an offense that averaged 326.9 yards per game.\r\nGreco was a third-team All-American and first-team All-MAC choice during his final season. He led a front wall that allowed only 16 quarterback sacks, as the offense generated 5,373 yards (447.8 yards per game), leading the MAC in total offense, rushing and scoring. He delivered 99 knockdowns, coming up with 14 touchdown-resulting blocks."

                "Overview": "An athlete blessed with incredible quickness coming off the edge, dislocated toes did what no other offensive lineman could do in 2007 - stop Quentin Groves. Those who witnessed his performance in the South Florida game last year realize that this is a player that needs to be unleashed on the football field to get maximum production from his tremendous athletic ability.\r\nDrawing comparisons to Dallas' DeMarcus Ware, Groves will probably shift to outside linebacker in the professional ranks. He received a crash course at that position late in his senior campaign and even earned a start at left outside linebacker in the Tennessee Tech game. With his tall, muscular physique, excellent speed, outstanding change of direction agility and superb body control as a pass rusher, NFL quarterbacks will soon have to contend with one of the most disruptive backfield penetrators in the 2008 NFL Draft.\r\nGroves is an affable sort, frequently smiling and cracking jokes. But the Auburn defensive end does have one group of guys he just doesn't care for: quarterbacks. \"I just really don't have a liking for them,\" Groves said. \"You can't hit them in practice. You have to stay off them. They don't do too much running. \"I don't like quarterbacks, period. I don't know why.\" \r\nLuckily for him, his primary job for the Tigers the past four seasons has been to harass and hit opposing quarterbacks. And that's something he has done well enough to earn All-American and All-Southeastern Conference honors as he went on to tie Auburn's 22-year-old career record of 26 sacks held by Gerald Robinson. \r\nAt Greenville-Weston High School, Groves earned USA Today All-USA second-team, Prep Star and Super Prep All-Region, Orlando Sentinel Super Southern 100, Clarion Ledger Dandy Dozen and that newspaper's All-State honors as a senior. He was also rated the third-best defensive end in the country by Prep Football Report and ESPN.com.\r\nGroves started all four seasons with the varsity and finished his senior season with 86 tackles, 22 sacks and three fumble recoveries. He also played tight end and caught three passes for 175 yards and two touchdowns. As a junior, he posted 89 tackles, 15 sacks, one interception and forced seven fumbles. He also lettered in basketball, competed in the discus and long jump in track and was a member of the power lifting team. \r\nGroves enrolled at Auburn in 2003, seeing brief action in the season opener vs. Southern California and vs. Western Kentucky before he was redshirted. He finished that year with three tackles (2 assists). The following season, Groves earned Freshman All-American honors from The Sporting News, Rivals.com and the Football Writers Association. \r\nDespite sharing left defensive end duties with Doug Langenfeld and Stanley McClover, Groves led the team with 7.5 sacks and 10 stops for losses as a reserve left defensive end. He posted 23 tackles (19 solos) in 13 games, adding four quarterback pressures and two forced fumbles. What made those figures even more impressive was the fact that he was nursing a right high ankle sprain that he suffered in fall camp. His performance earned him team Most Improved Defensive Lineman honors.\r\nIn 2005, Groves started three of 12 games at right defensive end, picking up third-team All-Southeastern Conference accolades. He registered 21 tackles (8 solos), ranking third on the team with six sacks and fourth with eight stops behind the line of scrimmage. He also caused a fumble, deflected a pass and returned a kickoff 13 yards.\r\nThe 2006 off-season was one that Groves would just as soon forget. He was placed on probation after he was in a car accident with no auto insurance and a suspended license. He was also arrested after police responded to a domestic dispute call. Back on the football field, he started all 13 games at right defensive end, picking up All-American third-team and All-SEC first-team honors.\r\nAs a junior, Groves led the Tigers with 9.5 sacks and ranked second on the squad with 11 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He totaled 35 tackles (24 solos) with seven quarterback pressures and also caused three fumbles.\r\nGroves, who is married and has already graduated, opted to return for his senior season after being projected as a likely middle-round pick in the NFL Draft. The chance to move up in the draft and land a big contract had plenty to do with the decision. There were other motivations, too. \"It was a money thing, and I wanted to win a championship with my teammates,\" Groves said. \"I felt like if I came back here, we had a good chance to go to Atlanta and compete for an SEC title.\"\r\nNamed to Bronko Nagurski Trophy, Chuck Bednarik Award and Hendricks Award preseason watch lists, Groves was having a banner 2007 campaign until he suffered dislocated toes on his right foot in the season's fifth game vs. Florida. The injury cost him two games of action and when he returned, he was used mostly in a reserve role before starting at left outside linebacker vs. Tennessee Tech after playing left defensive end in the Tigers' first five contests. He also closed out his career by starting vs. Clemson in the Chick-Fil-A Bowl at left end.\r\nIn 11 games in 2007, Groves registered 38 tackles (23 solos). He had three sacks, seven stops for losses and led the Southeastern Conference with a career-high 23 quarterback pressures. He also caused a pair of fumbles, including one that a teammate returned for a touchdown.\r\nIn 51 games at Auburn, Groves started 23 contests (16 at right end, six at left end and one at left outside linebacker). He registered 120 tackles (75 solos), tied the school career-record with 26 sacks for minus-169 yards and had 36 stops for losses of 194 yards. He was credited with 38 quarterback pressures, caused eight fumbles and deflected one pass."

He earned All-Big Ten honors three times and was selected the league's Freshman of the Year in 2004.\r\nHart attended Onondaga Central High School, where he was a three-time Class D and C Player of the Year selection, leading the team to three state titles in 2001-03. He was named first-team All-State as a senior, junior and sophomore and added first-team All-Division and Co-Player of the Year for Central New York as a junior. Hart was a first-team All-Division and All-Central New York choice as a freshman and sophomore.\r\nRated the nation's sixth-best back by Tom Lemming's Prep Football Report and listed as the top player in New York and the 12th-best running back in the country by Super Prep. He was rated the second-best prospect in New York, and sixth-best all-purpose back in the nation by Rivals100.com. He also received a four-star prospect rating from MaxEmfingerRecruiting.com.\r\nThe tailback holds the national high school records for touchdowns in a career (204), most consecutive 100-yard rushing games (47), career 100-yard rushing games (47) and career points (1,246), as he rushed for 11,232 yards on 935 carries in his prep career. He tallied 3,489 yards and 58 touchdowns on 239 carries and 67 total touchdowns as a senior. \r\nHart scored a state-record 61 touchdowns as a junior along with 2,846 rushing yards on 223 carries (12.8 yards per carry). He rushed for 3,341 yards and 51 touchdowns as a sophomore and 1,314 yards and 26 touchdowns on 119 carries -- 11 yards per carry -- as a freshman. He also averaged 10 points and five steals for the varsity basketball team.\r\nHart enrolled at Michigan in 2004, where he became only the third true freshman to lead the Big Ten in rushing with 1,455 yards and nine touchdowns on 282 carries (5.2-yard average) to earn league Freshman of the Year and Freshman All-American first-team honors. He was selected All-American third-team by College Football News, as he added 237 yards and a score on 26 receptions (9.1 avg). His per-game rushing average of 121.2 yards ranked 10th in the nation.\r\nIn 2005, Hart started all eight games in which he played. A hamstring strain sidelined him vs. Eastern Michigan and Wisconsin while an ankle sprain forced him to sit out the Indiana and Northwestern clashes. He still led the team with 662 yards on 150 attempts (4.4-yard average) and four touchdowns. He snared 16 passes for 154 yards (9.6 avg) and a score, as he also recorded one solo tackle.\r\nFully recovered, Hart returned to the nation's elite in 2006. He ranked ninth in the country in rushing, totaling 1,562 yards with 14 touchdowns on 318 carries (4.9-yard average). He finished fifth on the team with 17 receptions for 125 yards (7.4 avg) and scored 86 points. For that performance, he garnered consensus All-American and All-Big Ten Conference first-team honors. He finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy balloting and shared the Bo Schembechler Most Valuable Player Award with linebacker David Harris.\r\nDespite missing four full games and parts of two others during the 2007 season, Hart was a second-team All-American and Doak Walker Award finalist. He led the Big Ten in rushing and ranked fourth in the league in all-purpose yards. He touched the ball 265 times for 1,361 yards (5.1-yard average) and 14 touchdowns. He scored 84 points and caught eight passes for 50 yards (6.2) to pile up 1,411 all-purpose yards.\r\nIn 43 games at Michigan, Hart started 39 times. He became the fourth player in Big Ten Conference history to gain over 5,000 yards rushing in a career. He set the school all-time records with 1,015 carries for 5,040 yards (4.97-yard average) and finished third in UM history with 41 rushing touchdowns. He caught 67 passes for 566 yards (8.4 avg) and a pair of scores, finishing with 262 points. He touched the ball a school-record 1,082 times and ranks fifth at U-M with 5,606 all-purpose yards, an average of 130.37 yards per game."

                    "Compares To": "NATE BURLESON-Seattle...Hawkins is similar to Burleson in that he could be an efficient kickoff returner at the next level and has too much inconsistency in his game as a receiver. Hawkins has valid speed, but seems to shy away from contact, showing disinterest as a blocker. He is not the most urgent runner of pass routes, executing sloppy patterns and a lack of vision to locate the zone's soft areas. Produced catches as a senior, but the numbers came in spurts and for every solid game Hawkins had, there were several where he disappeared. He has shorter-than-ideal arm length and marginal leaping ability, making him a nonexistent factor in jump-ball situations. Like Burleson, Hawkins' athletic ability is far ahead of his football skill. While some might be impressed with his potential, he is more of a boom-or-bust player than the \"next great thing.\"",
                    "Negatives": "Bit high-cut and needs to drastically improve his overall strength...Has very short arms (29 5/8-inch length) and marginal leaping ability (26 1/2-inches), struggling to compete for the jump balls...Better athlete than player, as he will go through stretches of mental lapses on the field...Might struggle digesting a complicated playbook, as he needs more than several reps to retain plays...Needs to do a better job of scanning the field, as he is not always alert to coverage...Lacks consistency in his running stride, as he will take soft-angle cuts and tends to drift some on deep patterns...Hears footsteps going for the ball in a crowd and this loss of concentration leads to several drops of catchable throws...Has good timed speed, but lacks consistency with his initial burst off the line, as he will more likely take a rolling start rather than an explosive one...Must show better plant-and-drive agility coming out of his breaks, taking false steps, and must learn the concept of route progression...Not always alert to the cushion and needs to use his second gear better to get behind the defensive back...Makes only passive swipes as a blocker, showing strong disinterest in applying himself in that area...Disappears for long stretches when not involved in the play...Does not consistently use his speed to get free after the catch and, even though he lacks strength, he tries to run through tackles rather than elude...Likes to \"talk trash,\" but his lack of consistency prevents him from backing up those boasts...Emotional type that can be taken out of his game by a physical defender...Must develop better hand placement in attempts to escape the jam...Gets held up at the line often...Lacks crispness in his cuts and will round and spends a lot of time running into the defender rather than around him.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has an athletic, slender physique with lean muscle tone, a bit high-cut, but shows tapered thighs and calves...Has large, soft hands to extend for the ball away from his frame, compensating for shorter-than-ideal arms...Had good production in several games as a senior, when his athletic ability took over, but still needs to develop better football skills (timing on leaps, blocking, concentration)...Has the valid timed speed, body control and hand-eye coordination to run under most throws, but does need to refine his route-running...When his head is in the game and he gets a clean release, he is quick to get into his patterns...Better working in the zone, as he does an efficient job of settling into the soft area...Does a nice job of keeping his feet inbounds when working along the sideline...Runs with pitter-patter steps, showing good change-of-direction agility...Likes to dive for the low throws, showing good ability to adjust...Will get good position in attempts to twist and adjust to the ball in flight...Although not exceptionally fast, he shows the ability to get deep...When he locates the defender, he is capable of executing double moves to elude after the catch (will try to run over his man, at times)...Will catch with his body, but not as a crutch and does show good extension with his hands to pluck outside his framework despite a short reach...Does a good job of coming back for the ball when the quarterback has to scramble...Secures the ball close to his body and shows better vision locating seams and following blocks on kickoff returns than he does as a receiver...Has good balance to turn the corner when executing the reverse...Even though he rounds his cuts, he does show good hip sink, especially on control routes or settling in underneath...Plays better vs. the cushion than the press as he can't power through...Not real sudden, but when he utilizes his quickness and gets a clean release, he can get into his routes (rolling start hurts him vs. the press).\r"

                    "Compares To": "JOEY HARRINGTON-Atlanta...Henne is a good mechanic with the arm strength to air it out, but he needs to do a better job of timing throws, as he tends to hold on to the ball too long. He will get \"happy feet\" when pressured and run too early, but he lacks good ball-security skills and that has led to 14 fumbles in 39 games. He lacks ideal trajectory on his passes, as he will short-arm often, leading to 30 interceptions and 138 other passes deflected by the opposition. Like Harrington, he is an erratic performer, who can look sensational one minute, but tries to do too much and gets caught with the ball in his hands. Any general manager daring to consider him a first-round target will soon see himself on the unemployment line. Henne has too many of Harrington's deficiencies to be considered a franchise quarterback.",
                    "Negatives": "Lacks upper-body tone and does not have the ideal height you look for in a quarterback...Gets very animated making audible calls and pre-snap changes, but has just adequate judgment...Competitive, but tries to carry too much of the load and lacks the creativity to improvise...Needs to throw the ball away more, as he seems bent on forcing the ball in order to complete the play and it has resulted in several costly miscues (37 interceptions, 159 passes deflected, 20 fumbles)...Has good arm strength, but lacks a quick and explosive release...Quick to set up, but holds the ball too long and will pat it before unleashing it, lacking ideal trajectory, which has resulted in a high amount of passes getting defended on him (168-of-1,113 passes were either picked off or batted away by the opposition)...His arm strength is sometimes negated, as he takes too long to deliver the ball on deep outs...Will also underthrow when passing in the short-to-intermediate areas (better when he takes a three-step drop to throw, as he gets the ball out quicker and with better touch than when he pats the ball)...Very inconsistent on the deep-out, as he can get rattled by pressure...By holding the ball too long, he is susceptible to the costly sacks (sacked 89 times for losses of 588 yards)...Has good field smarts, making his throws into traffic befuddling...Has the strength to fire into the deep secondary, but his receivers often have to break off their routes, as he doesn't lead them well or get the ball to the outside shoulder and away from the defender...Will step up to avoid the rush, but will tuck the ball and run too early, leaving the ball exposed, resulting in a high amount of fumbles...Needs to improve his timing, especially on deep throws, as he does not hit his deep targets in stride that much (will also rush some of his throws)...Tends to get tunnel-vision and stay on his primary target too long. Must do a better job of reading route progressions and locating other targets...Needs to square his shoulders better when trying to throw downfield on the move, as he will look awkward trying to maintain balance on the run.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a thick lower-body frame, with good muscle tone in his thighs and calves...Generally durable athlete, who started 39 consecutive games before he was sidelined by injury...Has decent quickness moving around in the backfield, showing the balance and slide to step up and away from pressure but is not a threat as a runner...Ready to throw at the end of his pass drop. He might drift some in the pocket, but he shows good upper-body mechanics...Drop-back style passer, who can throw on the move but is not a running quarterback...Throws with a tight circle, flicking the ball out with adequate quickness and does a good job of maintaining focus downfield...While his release is not the fastest (will be late sometimes), he has the arm strength to stretch the field and air the ball out...Better when he takes a three-step drop and shortens his throws...Has a good grasp of the playbook and needs minimal reps to retain plays...Puts in the extra hours after practices and in the film room...Has good command in the huddle, and is slowly developing adequate leadership skills...Does a nice job of delivering the ball over the top, but is equally effective when using a three-quarters sidearm motion...When throwing in the short area, he shows a nice, tight circle on his attempts but lacks touch when he throws deliberately or high...Has functional skills and can throw a decent fade downfield, but must do it with better consistency...Not quick to flush and hangs tough under the pass rush, but must work on getting the ball on time...Does a decent job calling the audible and is an unselfish sort who will credit teammates...His short-area touch needs improvement, as he will leave a few short, but puts good zip on throws in that area...Throws impressive fades, but will miss the wide-open streak and short throws when pressured...Has the feet to avoid the bull rush and has shown improvement maintaining focus to complete the play, doing an adequate job of running through progressions, when he has time to scan the field. However, he will force it when pressured at times...Not a big running threat, but will buy some time with his feet.\r"

                    "Compares To": "MARION BARBER, III-Dallas...Hilliard is a load to bring down in one-on-one situations (54.9% of his non-touchdown runs the last two years, 130-of-299, required multiple defenders to bring him down). He has the forward body lean, leg drive and power to consistently get the tough yardage between the tackles. He is more quick than fast and has been quite as productive getting long yardage off draw plays. He is a capable receiver on controlled routes and has developed into a capable cut blocker. He has made strong recovery from an Achilles tendon injury, but because of a lack of blazing speed, he is better served as an inside runner than one who should be attacking the edges. Barber is a more polished route-runner and receiver, but when used on controlled routes, Hilliard has proven to be a capable safety valve.",
                    "Negatives": "Best served running between tackles, as he does not utilize shake-and-bake moves when trying to elude defenders in the second level, though he has good strength to break tackles...Has a quick stride to the hole, but is not considered explosive...Can be caught from behind on long runs and needs to develop a second gear as he won't separate from defenders in the open field...Used mostly on controlled routes and will drift a bit and take soft-angle cuts when asked to catch past the intermediate areas...Compensates for a lack of straight-line speed with balance and good change-of-direction agility...Has good weight-room strength, but must square up more often to push the pile. He was caught from behind on 24 runs in 2005, but improved in 2007, as he was tackled for losses just five times... Has good hands, but is rarely utilized in the passing scheme, as the team's offensive game plan did not utilize its backs much on a variety of pass routes.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has excellent bone structure and a muscular frame, broad shoulders, thick chest, wide hips, thick thighs and calves, well-defined arms with large hands and loose hips...May lack top-end speed but shows good athletic agility, change-of-direction skills and body control running the ball through the pile...Demonstrates very good hand-eye coordination as a receiver in controlled routes and uses his frame well to shield defenders from the ball...Takes the plays from the chalkboard to the playing field with no problems and has the ability to grasp a complicated playbook...Plays until the whistle and is a high-energy type with good aggression attacking the defender and breaking arm tackles...Runs with authority and at a low pad level...Has the field awareness to quickly locate the blitz and pass rush, facing up to defenders with good effort...Takes well to hard coaching and assumed leadership responsibilities...Has a team-first work ethic and is not one who will be enamored by press clippings or his face plastered on the television, but is a lunch-pail type with blue-chip ability...Shows adequate initial quickness in his running stride, but is quick getting out of his stance...Gets up to speed fast, but is also patient waiting for blocks to develop...Has the instincts and field vision to easily locate the cutback lane...Uses his blockers well and lowers his pads on contact while keeping his feet churning to gain additional yardage falling forward...More of a downhill runner, as he has excellent pick-and-slide agility...Demonstrates the ability to get to top acceleration smoothly and shows good running posture, finding the crease and hitting the holes hard...With his low pad level and strength when squaring his shoulders, he consistently knocks defenders back and breaks tackles...Gains positive yards after contact thanks to good body lean and, while he has marginal home-run speed, he shows a good change of pace and quick acceleration to bounce plays around the perimeter...More shifty and decisive than explosive, but is quick to find a lane and emerge downfield from trash to get into the second level...Good one-on-one battler working in space and shows very good ball security in traffic (has not fumbled in more than two seasons)...His loose hips and route-running ability will see him lined up from a flexed slot position on occasion...Has the large, natural hands to adjust and catch outside of his frame...Tough lead blocker who can widen and sustain the rushing lanes...Very willing when cutting defense lineman in pass protection or blocking linebackers on the QB draw...Shows ability to cut or square up, mirror and use hands in pass protection...Takes good angles when leading and neutralizing second-level defenders on the draw plays.\r"

                "Overview": "Lex Hilliard was sorely missed in the starting lineup for the Grizzlies in 2006, but he was able to return, fully recovered, from a torn left Achilles tendon, an injury suffered in '06 fall drills. During his grueling rehabilitation, the powerful tailback added more bulk and strength to his frame while also improving his overall quickness. \r\nHe has the raw power to carry defenders into the end zone and scored 40 touchdowns on the ground. He is only the fourth Montana player to score over 250 points (252) in a career and just the second player in school history to rush for over 3,000 yards (3,241).\r\nHilliard was a multi-sport standout at Flathead High School, where he earned four letters in football, three in track, and one in wrestling. The team's two-time Most Valuable Player on the gridiron, he also garnered All-State and All-Conference football accolades in each of his final three seasons with the squad.\r\nDuring his career, Hilliard set school all-time records by rushing for 3,419 yards and 44 touchdowns and compiling 4,410 all-purpose yards. He holds the school record with 1,384 yards and 14 touchdowns rushing as a sophomore, adding Great Falls Super State Team recognition.\r\nHilliard led the team to the Class AA state championship game as a junior. He participated in the East-West Shrine Game and the Montana-North Dakota All-Star Game. In track, he twice earned All-League honors while competing in the 100- and 200-meter dashes and 4x100 meter relays. He also threw the shot put. His sophomore, junior, and senior track teams all won state AA championships.\r\nAs a true freshman at Montana in 2003, Hilliard was a valuable reserve, playing in the final 12 games behind Justin Green. Hilliard was originally scheduled to redshirt, but the coaching staff felt he was capable of seeing extended playing time and activated him for the second game of the season. He went on to finish second on the team with 125 carries for 590 yards (4.7-yard average) and five touchdowns. He grabbed nine passes for 117 yards (13.0 avg) and returned a kickoff 12 yards while also posting two tackles.\r\nDespite starting just four of 14 games as a sophomore, Hilliard earned All-Big Sky Conference first-team honors. He paced the Grizzlies with 972 yards on 190 attempts (5.1-yard average) and 17 touchdowns (second-best season total in school annals). He made 22 catches for 211 yards (9.6 avg), returned one kickoff eight yards and amassed 1,191 all-purpose yards (85.1 yards per game).\r\nHilliard earned All-American second-team honors from The NFL Draft Report and was again named to the All-Big Sky Conference first-team. He ranked second in the conference in rushing in his first year as a starter, gaining 1,322 yards with 12 touchdowns on 249 carries (5.3-yard average). He added 144 yards and two scores on 11 catches (13.1-yard average) and also attempted a pass. His average of 122.17 all-purpose yards per game ranked fourth in the Big Sky; 110.17 of the per-game total came on the ground.\r\nOn everyone's preseason All-American list and an early favorite for the Payton Award (Division 1-AA's top player), Hilliard suffered a torn left Achilles tendon midway through August camp and was forced to miss the 2006 season. The ground game averaged 139.36 yards per game in his absence, compared to 162.17 yards with Hilliard in the lineup in 2005.\r\nIn 11 games in '07, Hilliard gained 102.9 rushing yards per game -- 1,132 rushing yards -- and scored 16 touchdowns, averaging 4.7 yards on 242 carries. He caught 15 passes for 119 yards with a long gain of 24 yards and averaged 7.9 yards per reception. With 1,251 total yards, he averaged 113.7 all-purpose yards per game.\r\nIn 49 games at Montana, Hilliard gained 4,016 rushing yards and scored 50 rushing touchdowns and 52 total TDs. He carried the ball 806 times and averaged five yards per carry in his career (82 rushing yards per game) with a long gain of 69 yards in 2005. Only Yohance Humphery (4,070 yards, 1998-2001) had more rushing yards in his Montana career."

He lacks the loose hips and strength to shock and jolt vs. the bull rush, but does a good job of widening the rush lanes, thanks to good hand placement and long arms. He can be pushed back to the pocket vs. a strong bull rush, as he has a marginal anchor. His injury problems are a concern, as it could impact his quickness, which is adequate at best.",
                    "Negatives": "Had a career-threatening knee injury in high school that resulted in nerve damage and needed minor surgery later to clean out debris...Coupled with his left leg (fibula) fracture late in 2007, further medical evaluation will be needed to get him a clean bill of health...Not explosive coming out of his stance and while he is a good position-type blocker, he lacks pop behind his hand punch...Might be a better fit inside at guard, as he's a bit of a waist bender with some stiffness in his hips that causes him to struggle vs. movement at times...Has to become more aggressive shooting his hands with force, as his punch won't shock or jolt an oncoming defender...Plays at a even keel tempo, but you would like to see a more \"nasty\" nature from a left tackle...Gets good hand placement, but must lock on, grab and drag down defenders with better intent (seems to be going through the motions at times)...When he gets too erect in his stance, bull rushers have had success pushing him back into the pocket and he needs to hunker down and anchor better (base gets narrow)...Likes to grab his opponent a lot, but needs to be more discrete when doing so to prevent costly penalties...Not the quickest in recognizing defensive schemes and will be late off the X's...Has problems moving laterally to handle the edge rushers and needs to be more forceful shooting his hands on reach blocks...Can handle the short pull, but his timed speed fails to translate when he has to move to the second level (looks sluggish moving long distances)...Better working in-line and must do a better job of staying square in his kick slide, as defenders have had success getting past him with good club moves on his outside shoulder...Must stay with his blocks longer moving upfield and has to take better angles when looking for second-level targets to hit.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a tall frame with good bone structure and can carry at least another 20 pounds of bulk without having the added weight affect his overall quickness...Lacks ideal explosiveness coming off the snap, but has developed into an efficient position-and-wall-off type of blocker...Has adequate foot speed to get into position, but needs to do this with more urgency...Hard worker in the training room, evident by the progress he made in recovering from a career-threatening injury in 2003...Struggles to adjust laterally, but shows a nice slide and good pad level working in-line, using his hands well to widen the rush lanes...Plays with better balance and base at the line of scrimmage than when on the move...Good position blocker who works to sustain, but you would like to see him play with more aggression...Plays the game with his feet flat and shows enough forward surge to get some movement...More of a position blocker in the running game, getting better inside leverage than on the outside...When he keeps his pads down, he is able to wall off or force the chase routes, as he is effective at turning his hips and mirroring in the short area...Uses his long arms and reach to engulf smaller opponents...Might lack the physical components to dominate, but shows good technique with his hands, keeping them active and within his frame...Can hit moving targets in the short area, but is best moving straight ahead than down the line (good on the short pulls, sluggish on the long ones)...Adequate readjusting inside, but has decent retreat skills to protect the pocket...Can flash some quickness to defeat the defensive end to the set point and protect the corner, but will give up his upfield shoulder when he gets too tall in his stance...Grabs and clutches to control defender, compensating for a lack of a jarring hand punch.\r"

                "Overview": "Hills is a former tight end who overcame a devastating injury that threatened his career during his high school days to go on and start 24 of his final 42 games with the Longhorns. Unfortunately, his college career would also be cut short due to a broken fibula in his left leg. He had made a smooth transition to left tackle from tight end as a redshirt freshman and proved to be a capable replacement for former All-American Jonathan Scott.\r\nHills was a three-year starter as a tight end at Alief Elsik High School, where he twice earned All-Greater Houston and All-District honors. A Parade All-America selection who added Class 5A third-team All-State recognition as a senior, he added second-team All-State accolades during his junior campaign.\r\nHills averaged 17.9 yards on 28 receptions his final two seasons. As a senior, he caught 15 passes for 275 yards for a team that reached the 5A Division I semifinals, but sustained a serious left knee injury in the first half of that contest. He also totaled 13 receptions for 227 yards and a touchdown as a junior. Before giving up basketball prior to his freshman year, he had earned a spot on the U.S. Junior National team.\r\nBecause of his knee injury, Hills was granted a medical hardship in 2003 at Texas, giving him time to recover from reconstructive surgery that repaired nerve damage in his knee. Doctors originally feared his playing days were over, but a grueling rehabilitation program saw Hills return to the field in 2004.\r\nAs a redshirt freshman, Hills shifted to left tackle. He appeared in seven games on offense and special teams in 2004, competing for playing time. He was part of a line that cleared the way for Texas to rank second in the nation in rushing (299.2 ypg), seventh in total offense (464.4 ypg) and 18th in scoring (35.3 ppg).\r\nIn 2005, Hills was a valuable reserve, seeing action in 11 games as Jonathan Scott's caddy at left tackle. That year, the line was responsible for the Longhorns ranking first in the nation in scoring offense (50.2 ppg), second in rushing offense (274.9 ypg) and third in total offense (512.1 ypg).\r\nWith Scott gone to the National Football League, Hills stepped into the starting lineup in 2006. He was an All-Big 12 Conference honorable mention and earned a spot on ESPN's All-Mayday Team for being one of college football's \"Toughest of the Tough,\" in addition to being named one of UT's Most Improved Offensive Players. With Hills clearing the way, Texas gained 162.6 rushing yards per game (34th NCAA), 391.5 total yards per game (23rd NCAA) and scored 35.9 points per game (seventh NCAA).\r\nIn 2007, Hills earned Walter Camp All-American first-team and was named to the All-Big 12 Conference first-team squad. He started the first 11 games at left tackle before he broke a bone in his left leg. In the 11 games with Hills at left tackle, the team averaged 471.5 yards in total offense and 265.2 yards passing per game, while allowing an average of 1.9 sacks. With Hills on the sideline, the offense averaged 415.5 yards in total offense, 201.5 yards passing and three sacks per contest."

Jackson is not the most explosive pass rusher you will find and might be a better fit playing inside, but he struggled in that alignment in the past as he failed to split double teams. He is inconsistent as an edge rusher, as he lacks ideal change of direction agility, but does a good job of getting inside penetration when he keeps his hands inside the framework. When he gets into a rhythm, like Anderson, he can deliver nice big plays. When he gets into a slump, the only way you can locate him is on the side of a milk carton. With his redirection problems, he is not going to be a great open-field tackler, but he can stack and control the isolated blocker, making him more of a situational type of pass rusher than an every-down player.",
                    "Negatives": "Might have to fill out his frame more for a potential shift to defensive tackle, as he lacks the top speed you look for in a defender coming off the edge...More of a semi-long strider who might show adequate acceleration and initial quickness, but lacks the explosiveness coming off the line to surprise a lethargic defender...Does not change directions quickly while on the move, taking false steps as he needs to gather...Will generally play with good toughness, but lacks consistency in his play and is not always aggressive and physical attacking the ballcarrier (motor runs hot and cold)...Has the field vision to make quick reads to recognize and react, but does not show that field awareness on a consistent basis...When he keeps his hands inside the framework, he has the ability to stack and control blockers, as well as the strength to shed, but does not always give the same effort, occasionally getting turned and walled off (will leave his chest exposed when his hands get too wide)...Struggles to defeat double teams, as he is too inconsistent with his leverage and needs to develop more pass rush moves...Uses his hands to control and defeat blockers, but his lack of consistency causes him to get controlled at times, from which he is not quick to recover... Flashes good lateral quickness and will accelerate in space, but plays tall at times and does not use proper technique to defeat blockers, as he tends to leave his feet too often... Has the strength to wrap up and take down the ballcarrier, but struggles to redirect and make the play while on the move (gets frustrated when his initial move fails)...Has never missed any games due to injuries, but his surgically repaired right ankle has given him problems and further medical evaluation might be needed...Has the ability to get up field when coming off the edge, but too often he leaves himself exposed and gives poor effort, resulting in him easily succumbing when he gets pushed passed the quarterback... Can close with good quickness when he escapes from blockers, but doesn't possess the explosiveness or quickness to close on the quarterback without getting a free lane... Will line up inside at times in the 3-4 alignment, but he struggles too much trying to split tackles and lacks the \"sand in his pants\" to perform there at his current playing weight at the next level...Does not have the suddenness you look for in an edge rusher, as he fails to utilize quick redirection skills and appears to be a better tackler in tight quarters than on the move (poor change of direction).\r",

Does a good job of coming off the edge and flattening in his quest to get to the quarterback, as he does a decent job of freeing up on twists and games, despite poor change of direction agility...Shows good rip and counter moves on the bull rush...Needs to improve his consistency here, but when he shoots his hands he can keep separation, control and get off blocks...Sometimes soft to play at the X's, but when he utilizes good hand placement he can play with leverage...Demonstrated an improved extra surge to finish the deal getting to the quarterback as a senior than he did in the past (has the pad level and strength to affect pass protection).\r"

The defensive end made a nice living terrorizing opposing quarterbacks, as he registered 30.5 sacks with 52 tackles behind the line of scrimmage during his time at Southern California.\r\nJackson contemplated leaving school early and applying for the 2007 NFL Draft, but former teammate, receiver Steve Smith (New York Giants), convinced him to return for his senior campaign. Smith went through the same thoughts after his junior year, but by returning to school he elevated his draft stock and was selected with the 51st pick in the second round of the 2007 draft. \"Coming back helped me a lot. I lucked out,\" Smith said. \"I talked to Lawrence, and he said, `If you're unsure, you should come back.' That's how I was a year ago.\" \r\nFormer teammates have marveled at his progress over the years, as several of them took him under their wing earlier in his career. Asked what he learned from some of his former teammates, like All-American defensive linemen Shaun Cody and Mike Patterson, Jackson replied, \"They all taught me the attitude that I need to attack everything and have a sense of urgency at all times.\" \r\nAt Inglewood High School, Jackson earned 2002 Super Prep, Prep Star, Student Sports, Tom Lemming, CNNSI.com and The Insiders.com All-American first-team honors.

He recorded 142 tackles, with 11 sacks, four fumble recoveries and two interceptions in 2002 while playing on the defensive line and at middle linebacker. \r\nAs a junior in 2001, he made the Cal-Hi Sports All-State Underclass, All-CIF Division X and Los Angeles Times All-Star squads. The Los Angeles Times All-South Bay Lineman of the Year also picked up South Bay Daily Breeze All-South Bay first team and All-Ocean League Defensive MVP accolades. He registered 134 tackles, including 22 sacks, plus two interceptions (one returned for a TD), seven forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and three blocked kicks in 2001, leading the team to the 2001 CIF Division X semifinals. During Jackson's sophomore season, Inglewood advanced to the CIF Division X finals. In his career, he had 57 sacks. He also was on Inglewood's track team. \r\nJackson enrolled at Southern California in 2003, but spent the season on the service team, earning that squad's Defensive Player of the Year Award. He underwent surgery on his right ankle after that season to have debris removed. He went on to earn a spot in the starting lineup the following season, picking up Freshman All-American and All-Pac 10 Conference Freshman Team recognition. In 13 games, he made 32 tackles (19 solos) and tied for second on the team with six sacks, adding 11 stops for losses and an interception.\r\nAs a sophomore, he was an All-American third-team and All-Pac 10 Conference first-team choice, in addition to being selected the team's Defensive Lineman of the Year. He ranked fourth in the conference with a team-high 10 sacks and was second on the squad with 13 stops for losses. He caused four fumbles, recovered two others, blocked a kick and deflected six passes.\r\nJackson's left groin injury early in the 2006 season saw him undergo a bit of a slump. Head coach Pete Carroll recommended to him that he read W. Timothy Gallwey's \"The Inner Game of Tennis.\" \"At first, it seemed kind of weird to me and I just let it sit there on top of the bookshelf,\" the defensive end recalled. But then I started reading it and I couldn't stop. It just helped me relax and stay calm. It's about reacting and learning to relax. It's about trusting yourself and not criticizing yourself so much.\"\r\n\"It helped out because I was being critical and judgmental. I just gave in to those feelings. I would be disappointed in myself. It hindered me physically. After wins, I wouldn't be excited about the win, I would be disappointed with no sacks,\" Jackson stated. \"Coach Carroll and I had a talk about how I was trying too hard and how it inhibits you from being yourself. If you tell yourself to do this or do that, it slows down your play.\" \r\nHe would finish the 2006 campaign with 43 tackles (26 solos), four sacks, 11 stops for losses and two blocked kicks. He also picked off a pass, deflected three others and caused a fumble that he recovered while starting all 13 contests.\r\nAs a senior, Jackson emerged, alongside defensive tackle Sedrick Ellis, to give the Trojans a formidable front wall. The Trojans ranked fourth in the nation in run defense (84.15 ypg) and second in total defense (273.15 ypg). The defensive end earned second-team All-American honors, as the team captain also picked up All-Pac 10 first-team accolades, in addition to sharing the team's Defensive Player of the Year Award.\r\nIn his final season, Jackson ranked third in the league and led the team with 10.5 sacks and 17 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He totaled 60 tackles (31 solos) with a pair of forced fumbles and a fumble recovery. He also deflected three passes. \r\nIn 52 games, Jackson started 51 contests. He registered 181 tackles (108 solos) with 30.5 sacks for minus-181 yards and 52 stops for losses totaling 247 yards. He recovered four fumbles and caused seven others while also blocking three kicks. He deflected 13 passes and also intercepted two others for 22 yards in returns."

With his injury woes behind them, Johnson finally came into his own as a senior, as he learned to vary his speed and showed much better patience waiting for blocks to develop. He is much stronger than his size indicates, but with his outstanding timed speed he is a versatile threat who is more than capable of handling kickoff duties. With his suddenness off the line of scrimmage and hand extension ability, he also can line wide in passing situations.",
                    "Negatives": "Durability might be a concern with his lack of ideal size, but he shows good power and leg drive to break tackles and is not a liability taking the ball up the middle... Showed inconsistent leg churn as a runner in 2006, but it was likely due to his turf toe injury, as he ran at a lower pad level and with crisper cuts during his senior year... Needs to work on his blocking technique, as he lacks good hand placement to lock on and sustain...Shows the ability to take the plays from the chalkboard to the playing field, but had some academic struggles...When he keeps his pad level down running with the ball, he can break tackles, but when he gets too tall in his pads, he loses some of his leg drive and can be contained running between the tackles...Has shown good ball security, but has smaller-than-ideal hands (7 1/4-inches).\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a compact frame with good overall muscle tone, thick chest, broad shoulders, tapered thighs and legs and room on his frame to carry at least another 10 pounds of bulk without having it affect his explosive quickness...Efficient route runner whose speed makes him a valid deep threat when lining up wide...Shows good athletic agility and vision, doing a nice job of planting and driving to reach the cutback lanes, showing excellent lateral movement and explosion...Has a superb vertical burst, staying low in his pads while showing crisp hip snap with his lateral change of direction...Patient enough to allow blocks to setup, whether carrying or returning the ball...Smart football player with good football intelligence and is effective at picking up the blitz and stunt...Shows good peripheral vision to locate even the smallest of creases and is sudden running through the holes...Knows the offense well and is capable of playing either as a receiver or halfback...Has excellent work habits and is the type that approaches practices much like a game (all business on the field)...Is more of a leader by example type than a rah-rah one, but he is good at mentoring the younger players...Tough inside runner with the leg drive and power to get physical with defenders in attempts to break tackles, despite a lack of ideal size...Takes well to hard coaching...Very decisive in his moves and has a very good feel for the cutback lanes...Has that second gear and explosion needed to accelerate vertically off cuts...Runs behind his pads with good instincts, doing a nice job of driving and spinning to get extra yards after initial contact...Runs behind pads well and has more than enough speed and quickness to reach the corner...Has good vision with quick plant and drive agility when redirecting and sets up the defender well with his stop-and-go action...The thing you notice on film is his impressive athleticism and courage, as he will not hesitate to leap over the tackler, keeping his balance while moving forward, thanks to good body lean...Does a good job of securing the ball before heading upfield...Has natural hands and good extension to catch the ball outside his framework...Used mostly on shallow crossing routes, sideline take-offs and out routes, but could possibly shift to receiver at the next level due to his explosive acceleration and ability to separate after the catch...Demonstrates good running ability on kickoff returns, as he will follow his blocks well...Has the quickness and burst in and out of his cuts to take the ball long distances, whether running, returning or catching the ball...Prior to his senior year, Johnson was considered a marginal space blocker, as he sometimes over-extended or lunged at the defender with his head down, resulting in missed blocks. But as a senior, he showed much better hand placement and punch, doing a nice job of locating the blitz and using his hands to lock on and sustain...Has also become a proficient cut blocker, taking good angles to locate and neutralize second level defenders.\r"

                "Overview": "Few teams in the collegiate or professional ranks have such an explosive and versatile weapon as the Pirates boast with Chris Johnson. Fully recovered from turf toe that hampered him in 2006 and neck surgery during the 2007 off-season, Johnson established himself as the premier all-purpose back in the NCAA Division 1-A ranks during his final campaign.\r\nAt Olympia High School, Johnson earned All-Orange County honors as a senior and was selected the Most Valuable Player for his performance in the Orange County All-Star Game. He was rated among the top 100 players in state of Florida by Super Prep, as he scored eight touchdowns during his final campaign, despite missing four contests with an injury.\r\nAs a junior, he rushed for more than 1,000 yards. A standout weight lifter, he boasted the top power numbers among the team's skill position players with a 265-pound power clean-lift and a 315-pound bench-press. Johnson also competed in track. He was timed at 10.38 seconds in the 100-meter sprint and ran the anchor leg on the fastest 4x100 relay team in the nation that won Golden South and Golden West national titles.\r\nJohnson proved to be a dangerous kickoff returner as a true freshman in 2004 at East Carolina, where he was originally signed as a wide receiver. He gained 765 yards on 37 attempts (20.7 avg) and made a solo tackle on special teams. He started seven of 11 games at tailback, leading the team with 561 yards and five touchdowns on 134 carries (4.2 avg). He caught 32 passes, second-best on the team, for 236 yards (7.4 avg) and two scores, totaling 42 points for the year. \r\nJohnson ranked fourth in Conference USA and 24th nationally with 1,562 all-purpose yards, an average of 142.0 yards per game. For those efforts, he was named to the Conference USA All-Freshman squad as a running back and kickoff return specialist. He was also named the team's Outstanding Newcomer-of-the-Year.\r\nDuring his sophomore campaign, Johnson started all 11 games, leading the team with 176 rushes for 684 yards (3.9 avg) and six touchdowns. He grabbed 35 passes for 356 yards (10.2 avg) and two scores. His 67 receptions during his first two seasons set the school career-record for running backs. He returned 21 kickoffs for 459 yards (21.9 avg), scored 48 points and ranked second in the Conference USA ranks with an average of 136.27 all-purpose yards per game in 2005.\r\nListed on numerous preseason All-Conference USA first-team squads, Johnson was limited to five starting assignments, seeing limited action in seven other games during the 2006 season due to turf toe and also had neck surgery in the off-season that kept him out of spring drills. He still finished second on the team with 314 yards and four touchdowns on 78 carries (4.0 avg) while starting four times at tailback. He started the season finale at flanker, coming up with 21 catches for 176 yards (8.4 avg). He ranked third in the conference with a 22.95-yard average on 21 kickoff returns for 482 yards and a touchdown. He scored 30 points, made one solo tackle and averaged 81.0 all-purpose yards per game.\r\nIn 2007, Johnson established a new Conference USA record with an average of 227.69 all-purpose yards per game. That figure led the nation, and he was 24th with 109.5 rushing yards per game. He became the 24th player in Division 1-A history to amass more than 6,000 all-purpose yards in a career. \r\nIn 47 games at East Carolina, Johnson started 34 times at tailback and twice at receiver (vs. Wake Forest in 2004 and South Florida in 2006). He became the 11th player in school annals to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a career, amassing 2,982 yards with 32 touchdowns on 624 attempts (4.8 avg). He holds the school career record for running backs with 125 receptions for 1,296 yards (10.4 avg) and 10 scores. \r\nJohnson holds the school career record with 2,715 yards and a pair of touchdowns on 115 kickoff returns (23.6 avg). He completed two pass attempts for no gain and recorded two solo tackles. His 264 points scored ranks second on ECU's all-time record list. He touched the ball 864 times, becoming the first player in school annals to amass more than 5,000 all-purpose yards in a career, totaling 6,993 yards."

He is not as big or strong as Randall, but has the same body control, balance and scrambling ability that forces defenses to account for not only his arm, but also his feet.

Very smooth in his retreat from center to his throwing point, demonstrating the slide-and-adjust agility to step up in the pocket or roll out to avoid pressure...Shows very good knee bend and the ability to weave through traffic, making a good effort to provide ball security before heading up field...Capable of handling the mental aspect of the game, as he makes all of the required reads and checks to excel in a pass-oriented offense...Won't hesitate to square his shoulders and drive his legs to gain tough yardage up the middle rather than passively head to the sidelines to avoid any contact...Doesn't force the ball into traffic and can keep defenses honest with his long-range arm strength or ability to weave in and out of traffic as a ball carrier...With his body control, agility and hip flexibility, he is quick driving back from center, doing a nice job of setting his feet in either 3-step or 5-step drops...Gets to his throwing point fluidly and has the balance to make all the throws on the run...Nimble and agile rolling out of the pocket and has the balance to step up and avoid pocket pressure...While patient waiting for the plays to develop, he is not the type who will hold on to the ball too long and then try to force the action to make the play, as he knows when he needs to throw the ball away...Demonstrates the compact delivery and throwing motion, along with the wrist flick, to get the ball out cleanly and quickly. He has a compact motion, holding the ball chest-high to execute a fluid three-quarter release...Seems more comfortable airing the ball out, rather than playing dink-and-dunk with a short-area passing game (accuracy is a bit off on screens, wheel routes)...Effective at throwing ropes 40 yards downfield with ease...Accurate throwing from the pocket and has the balance to also make those throws on the move...Consistent setting his feet and shows good mechanics delivering the ball on time...Likes to air the ball out more than stay underneath, as he knows how to get the ball to his targets in stride rather than have them wait or come back for it...Keeps his cool under pressure and knows that when all else fails, he has the feet to step up and avoid the pocket pressure...Stands tough under duress and shows confidence in his ability to execute the play...Patient waiting for plays to develop and does a very good job with ball security...Vocal on the field, demonstrating a little bit of Brett Favre with his bravado...Capable of getting big yardage with his feet and is a dangerous threat running with the ball...As a ballcarrier, he shows good strength and body lean to gain additional yardage after the initial hit and is conscious of protecting the ball and shielding it from the defenders...Builds to top acceleration nicely and is alert to coverages (won't run into spots too often)...Knows how to get the ball to his deep targets over their outside shoulder without the receiver having to adjust.\r"

                "Overview": "One of the game's best-kept secrets, at least where the national media is concerned, Johnson has greatly impressed professional scouts that have actually seen him perform. Many will agree that he is one of the most exciting athletes to watch with the ball in his hands, bringing back memories of Michael Vick and Vince Young during their collegiate days.\r\nJohnson brings tremendous energy to the field and is the type defenses must account for on every play. Whether it is unleashing a deep pass, putting zip on his short throws or playing like a whirling dervish running with the ball, the talented quarterback has proven he can strike from anywhere on the field.\r\nJohnson earned first-team All-City, Oakland Chamber of Commerce Prep of the Month and Most Improved Player honors as a senior at Oakland Technical High School. He was also named Most Inspirational his junior year when he could not play due to injury. He threw for 1,900 yards and 22 touchdowns with just two interceptions his senior season, leading his team to the Oakland Athletic League Championship.\r\nThe versatile athlete also lettered in basketball and track. He was an honorable mention All-City choice in hoops and finished in the high jump (6'5\") at the Oakland Athletic League Championships.\r\nLooking for an opportunity to be part of a rising football program, Johnson turned down scholarship offers from St. Mary's and Idaho State to enroll at San Diego in 2004. That year, he appeared in seven games, playing behind Todd Mortensen. He hit on 12-of-22 passes (54.5%) for 135 yards, no touchdowns and one interception. He added 39 yards and a pair of scores on 13 carries (3.0 avg), caught a 3-yard pass and returned a pair of punts for a 1-yard loss.\r\nWith Mortensen having graduated, Johnson took over starting duties in 2005, going on to win the first of two Pioneer Football League Offensive Player of the Year honors. He was a first-team All-American choice by The Sports Network and named Division 1-AA Offensive Back of the Year by the Football Gazette. \r\nJohnson ranked 11th in the nation in pass completions (260-of-371 attempts), setting school season-records for pass completion percentage (70.1), yards passing (3,256) and touchdown passes (36). He finished second nationally with a 171.51 passing efficiency rating and ranked fifth with an average of 302.92 yards per game in total offense. His 3,635 yards in total offense is the second-highest season total in school history.\r\nIn 2006, Johnson received consensus All-American and unanimous All-Pioneer Football League first-team recognition.

He added to his resume by taking over kickoff return duties in 2007, ranking 10th in the nation with an average of 185.67 all-purpose yards per game during his final season. \n>From a family of 10 children, he is the second member to compete on the collegiate gridiron. His older brother, Chris, played at Central Michigan (1993-96). \nParmele was ranked 16th on the Detroit Free Press \"Fab 50\" Team and 31st on the Detroit News' \"Blue Chip List\" as a senior at Dow High School. He was named first-team Class A All-State and earned the league's Most Valuable Player award. He was also named the 24th-best player in the state of Michigan by The Midwest Football Recruiting News.\nIn his final season, Parmele rushed for 1,507 yards and 23 touchdowns. He made first-team All-League as a junior after gaining 1,253 yards on the ground. The three-time All-Academic team choice added 705 yards on the ground as a sophomore. He also ran track as a sprinter and played basketball. \nRather than enroll at his brother's former school, Parmele ventured to Toledo in 2004. He was listed third on the depth chart at tailback, appearing briefly in nine games. He totaled 183 yards and scored three times on 42 carries (4.4 avg). He also gained 24 yards on four catches. As a sophomore, he was elevated to second string behind Trinity Dawson at tailback, but missed the Northern Illinois and Ohio University games with a right ankle sprain. He finished with 64 attempts for 294 yards (4.6 avg) and three touchdowns.\nParmele emerged from 2006 fall camp as the Rockets' new starting tailback. He led the team and ranked second in the league with 1,131 yards and eight touchdowns on 207 carries (5.5 avg). The first-team All-Mid American Conference runner also snared 16 passes for 128 yards, as he also averaged 15.3 yards on three kickoff returns.\nAs a senior, Parmele again received All-MAC first-team recognition after his banner campaign. He finished ninth in the nation in rushing, with 1,511 yards on 276 runs (5.5 avg) that included 14 touchdowns. He caught 17 passes for 157 yards (9.2 avg) and one score, as he also returned 20 kickoffs for 560 yards (28.0 avg) and a touchdown. His 2,228 all-purpose yards were good for 10th place in the NCAA.\nParmele started 24 of 44 games at Toledo, ranking fourth in school history with 3,119 yards on 589 carries (5.3 avg), including 28 touchdowns. He made 41 catches for 350 yards (8.5 avg) and one score. He returned 25 kickoffs for 628 yards (25.1 avg) and one touchdown, as he scored 180 points.

He makes good plays on the ball in flight with his natural hands, but like McCree, he can frustrate a coach with poor route-recognition skills. He is really not a physical tackler and, unless a team is looking for depth in sub packages, there are too many leaks in his game to project Steltz as a starter. Still, he is a solid kick-coverage defender and can make a decent living doing that and playing in the sub package.",
                    "Negatives": "Has just adequate zone-coverage skills and lacks the second gear to recover when receivers get behind him...Is even worse in man coverage, lacking a feel for route progression and yields too much cushion...Better attacking the ball than as a tackler, as he does not generate much force behind his hits, especially when playing vs. the run inside the box...Not really a good leaper, but compensates with sure hands and good timing...Shows just adequate closing burst and fails to seal the deal on the quarterback when taking a wide loop off the edge to pressure the pocket...Needs time to read and diagnose the plays, but shows good urgency once he locates the ball...Has spent a lot of time in training (pilates, yoga) to improve his overall flexibility, but is too stiff in his turns and too rigid in his stance to stay with and mirror the receiver in man coverage...Is the type that will bite on play-action and freeze vs. double moves...Comes out of his backpedal taking short, choppy steps...Not a punishing hitter as you would want in a strong safety, but he lacks the loose hips, range and speed to close on the ball as a free safety...Must develop better tackling technique, as he is more of an arm tackler who sees too many opponents bounce off his hits...Can make plays in front of him, but does not have a good burst to close suddenly on the play...Doesn't anticipate plays.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a well-built frame with good muscle tone, a thick back and chest and tapered thighs and calves, but does not play to his weight-room strength...Best playing in the shallow zone in sub packages as he has the natural hands (small, but sure) to look the ball in cleanly outside his frame...Shows adequate ball skills and leaping ability, but gets to most throws with good positioning and timing instead...Plays the game with good intensity and is a good vocal leader in the huddle who works hard in the training room, and the coaches have to shut the lights out in order for him to leave...Adequate run defender, as he is not really a physical hitter, but will give good effort to come up and help in the box...His steps in his backpedal and turn need refinement, but he does manage to close well on plays in front of him...More quick than he is fast, as he has the feet to shadow underneath, but needs to generate better hip snap to stay with the receivers on pass patterns...Does not have the burst to recover and trail deep, but is better when he can get his hands up to deflect or intercept the pass (too limited in man coverage to be a full-time starter)...When he stays low in his pads, he is better at getting into position to make the play (has vision to make plays in front when playing in the zone, but is a liability in man coverage)...Times his leaps well and knows how to use his arm length to reach around and deflect the ball away from the receiver...Lacks a burst to close in a hurry, but will keep plays in front of him when he gets physical with his hands in attempts to reroute...Plays the zone deep to compensate for his lack of recovery speed, but he is a high-motor type that will hustle to the ball...Looks natural extending for the ball away from his frame and, while his vertical speed is just adequate, he takes good angles to the ball in flight...Struggles to shed offensive linemen in the box, but will show up to lend run support (when he drops his weight, he is better competing in tight areas).\r"

                "Overview": "A finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award, given to the nation's top defensive back, Steltz continued to excel in 2007, leading a secondary that ranked ninth in the nation, allowing just 182.71 yards per game. His ability to be in the right place to come up with the big interceptions was one of the main reasons the Tigers walked home with the national championship.\r\nGetting key contributions from the Steltz family is customary to LSU fans. Craig was preceded by his older brother, Kevin (2003-05) on the Louisiana State campus, where the older sibling was known for his bone-jarring blocks as a fullback.\r\nSteltz has been a good \"student of the game,\" as he was taken under the wing of perennial All-American safety LaRon Landry. \"I learned a lot from LaRon, and he was a great player,\" Steltz said in 2007 spring drills. \"I tried to practice every time like I was the starter last (season) because you never knew when your time was going to step up, and you had to be ready. I think that helped with the games I started last year.\" \r\nAs a leader, Steltz said directing his defensive teammates on the field is one area he is improving every game. He worked diligently to master defensive calls and alignment to be the quarterback of the defense.\r\nConsidered the state's top safety prospect in 2003 at Archbishop Rummel High School, Steltz showed his versatility playing running back and returning kicks. He was named to Fox Sports Network South's Countdown to Signing Day \"All-South\" first-team, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution Super Southern 100, the Baton Rouge Advocate Super Dozen and the New Orleans Times-Picayune's Top 20 Blue-Chip list, in addition to earning first-team Class 5A All-State recognition in 2003.\r\nSteltz finished his senior year with 30 tackles and two sacks, despite suffering from two nagging injuries. He led a ferocious defensive unit that spearheaded the Raiders to an 8-2 district championship season and a regional round playoff berth. He also grabbed nine interceptions and made 120 tackles as a junior.\r\nAs a true freshman, Steltz saw limited action in four games at Louisiana State in 2004, as he was hampered by a broken right thumb, finishing with one assisted tackle. He was used extensively in the team's nickel package during his sophomore year, but also earned three starting assignments in 2005. He posted 40 tackles (28 solo) with three quarterback pressures and a fumble recovery. He had one interception, two pass breakups, gained three yards on a fake punt and also recovered a blocked punt for a 29-yard touchdown return.\r\nHoping to win a starting job as a junior, Steltz continued to play in the team's sub packages. He started twice at strong safety vs. Alabama and in the Sugar Bowl vs. Notre Dame. He registered 42 tackles (20 solo) with a sack, two stops for losses and three QB pressures. He also deflected five passes and became the first player in school history to have an interception in four consecutive games.\r\nA consensus All-American and All-Southeastern Conference selection as a senior, Steltz again led the Tigers with six interceptions, piling up 153 yards in returns, as he finally enjoyed a full season as the team's starting strong safety. He also paced the squad with a career-high 101 tackles (64 solo) that included one sack and five stops behind the line of scrimmage. He also batted away seven passes, caused three fumbles and recovered another.\r\nIn 44 games at LSU, Steltz started 19 times. He recorded 184 tackles (92 solo) with two sacks for minus-17 yards, seven stops for losses of 34 yards and six quarterback pressures. He caused three fumbles, recovered two others and returned a blocked punt 29 yards for the only touchdown during his career. He gained three yards on a rushing attempt, broke up 14 passes and intercepted 11 others for 286 yards in returns (26-yard average)."

He was sidelined once again in March 2007, after he ruptured his right knee patella tendon. \r\nAfter a long rehabilitation period, Bowman returned to the lineup in 2007 after missing the previous season.

He made more than 50 tackles as a freshman, including 40 solo stops, and as a sophomore had two fumble recoveries and two fumbles caused. In addition to his defensive accolades, he also saw spot duty on offense as a wide receiver.\r\nBowman selected Nebraska over offers from Oklahoma, Texas Tech and South Carolina among others in 2005. He missed the Pittsburgh contest with a leg injury, but started five late-season games at right cornerback. He produced 27 tackles (24 solos) with a pair of interceptions and 14 pass deflections during his first season with the Huskers.\r\nTwo leg surgeries wiped out his 2006 campaign, with Bowman returning to the field in 2007. A left hamstring forced him to leave the Southern California game and sit out the following week vs. Ball State.

The 2005 National Junior College Athletics Association National Defensive Player of the Year played in the junior college championship game during his first two seasons. During both of his years at Ohio State, the Buckeyes also played in the national title game.\r\nStill, Grant experienced a whirlwind travel adventure during his football career, which began during his freshman year at Foothill (Cal.) High School, where he lettered as a running back and safety. He moved to Georgia, attending Meadow Creek (Gwinett County, Ga.) High as a sophomore and junior. The football program was lacking and Grant moved with his brother, going on to play at Norcross (Ga.) High as a senior. He lettered as a tailback, gaining 450 yards with six touchdowns on only 35 carries (12.9 avg) during his senior campaign. He then left Norcross High in the winter, moving back to California, where he re-enrolled and graduated from Foothill High.\r\nGrant enrolled at Murray State in 2003, but failed to qualify academically. He spent the year out of school, working as a youth football coach during the fall in the Sacramento area. He then enrolled at the City College of San Francisco in 2004. He shifted to middle linebacker, earning All-Region I, All-California and All-NorCal Football Conference honors. He posted 90 tackles (63 solos) with six sacks, as he caused four fumbles, recovered two others and led the nation with six blocked punts, scoring on a 65-yard runback. \r\nAs a sophomore, Grant earned NJCAA All-American and National Defensive Player of the Year honors. The All-NorCal Football Conference Defensive MVP delivered 85 tackles (56 solos) with four sacks and nine stops for losses from his weak-side outside linebacker position. He intercepted six passes, returning one for a touchdown and again ended up blocking six punts.\r\nGrant was scheduled to enroll at the University of Florida, but was a math class short of academic requirements. He decided to enroll at Ohio State in 2006, where he was the first junior college transfer signed by head coach Jim Tressel. He backed up all three starting linebackers (mostly played in the middle), earning his only start in 12 games vs. Bowling Green at strong-side linebacker. He collected 18 tackles (8 solos), as he assisted on a sack, caused a fumble, picked off a pass and deflected two others. He also blocked a punt that he recovered for a 9-yard return.\r\nGrant took over strong-side outside linebacker duties as a senior. He ranked fifth on the team with 51 tackles (35 solos), as he tied for second on the squad with five sacks and finished third with 9.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He broke up a pass, picked off another and blocked two kicks, returning one 8 yards.\r\nIn 25 games at Ohio State, Grant started 14 contests. He recorded 69 tackles (43 solos) with 5.5 sacks for minus-34 yards and 10 stops for losses of 45 yards. He caused a fumble, deflected three passes and intercepted two others for 68 yards in returns. He also blocked three kicks, returning two errant punts for a total of 17 yards."

He led the team in tackles with a career-high 106 during his final campaign, earning All-American and All-Pac 10 Conference recognition.\r\nThe Sun Devils' Most Valuable Defensive Player (2007) played at nearby Maryvale High School before arriving on ASU's campus.

He is a superb pass thief and plays with reckless abandon, especially on special teams. He does bite a lot on activity in the backfield and is slow to see the play develop, but does close with good urgency when he locates the ball.

Has the athletic agility to run laterally and clear trash to make tackles along the sidelines...Strong tackler who comes to balance well, when he doesn't duck his head before delivering the hit...Gets a handful of forced fumbles with his ability to collide, stun and wrap up ballcarriers with good explosion behind his hits...Simply flies down the sidelines as a gunner on the special team units and has a knack for hurling himself in attempts to break up the wedge.\r"

All three sons of Patty and Wally Justice have excelled in the game. Steve's older brother, Kevin, played at the Air Force Academy (1996-2000) and another brother, Doug, was a linebacker at the University of North Carolina.\r\nSteve Justice was a three-year starter on both the offensive and defensive lines at New Smyrna Beach High School.

He was named the District 4-A Player of the Year in 2002, in addition to garnering first-team All-Five Star Conference and two-time All-Central Florida accolades. \r\nRated the 42nd-best offensive guard nationally by Rivals100.com, Justice graded 91% for blocking consistency on offense and tallied 54 tackles, including 10 for losses, and two sacks on defense. He also earned first-team All-County and second-team All-Area honors in wrestling. He graduated in the top 10 of his class, received the National Scholar-Athlete Award from the U.S. Army Reserve and was named DAR Citizen of the Year. \r\nJustice enrolled at Wake Forest in 2003, choosing the university because of \"the small class size, small campus, beautiful area and great football.\" He performed on the scout team that year, learning the technique to play the center position. He was used mostly on the punt unit in 11 games as a reserve center in 2004, participating in 30 offensive snaps.\r\nAs a sophomore, Justice took over center duties. The Raleigh News & Observer's All-Big Four Team choice was one of only three players on offense to start all 11 games, participating in all 855 offensive snaps on the season.

He was twice named ACC Offensive Lineman of the Week, starting all 14 games in the middle. In 829 plays, he posted 66 knockdowns, including nine touchdown-resulting blocks. The offense would go on to average 307.0 yards per game.\r\nAs a senior, Justice earned All-American honors from six different news services, in addition to being chosen All-ACC first-team.

                "Overview": "Called by the Purdue coaching staff the team's hardest worker in practices and games, little was known about Keglar entering his senior season, despite starting most of his career for the Boilermakers. With his chiseled frame and outstanding foot speed, he has the size and quickness teams are looking for in a weak-side outside linebacker. \r\nHis impressive showing at the 2008 NFL Combine was the result of Keglar preparing for that event under the guidance of Cincinnati's David Pollack. The Bengals' linebacker has not played a down of football since sustaining a career-threatening neck injury in Week Two of the 2006 season, but that hasn't stopped him from contributing in other ways to the game he loves. \r\nPollack is acting as an assistant trainer and mentor to potential pro prospects who have been training at Ignitions Athletics Group in Mason, Ohio. Although many of the prospects have stood out during training, one has caught the eye of Pollack and now the NFL, especially after finishing first in seven agility tests events the outside linebackers were put through in Indianapolis.\r\n\"He's an unbelievable athlete,\" Pollack said. \"He has balance, explosion and great flexibility. He has a lot of gifts. I haven't seen him play on the field, but just seeing him work off the field was pretty dog-gone impressive. He's a guy you can tell that works hard every single day. You hear that about a lot of people, but I can't say that about many people I've been around. He trains hard and we competed hard going against each other every day. He brought his lunch box every day. He definitely came to work and wasn't afraid to outwork everybody.\"\r\nKeglar was an honorable mention All-State, first-team All-County and first-team All-Conference selection as a senior at Pike High School. He was rated the eighth-best player in Indiana and the 26th-ranked outside linebacker nationally by Rivals.com. He was also rated the 51st-best player in the Midwest by Super Prep.\r\nIn his final season, Keglar recorded 83 tackles, including five sacks, with two forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and one interception. On offense, he rushed for 717 yards on 82 carries (8.7 avg) with five touchdowns, adding a 20-yard touchdown catch as the team won the conference championship.\r\nAs a junior, he collected 72 tackles, including four sacks, with four fumble recoveries and one interception. He also participated in swimming and track-and-field. Keglar was the sectional winner in the 50 freestyle as a junior. He placed third in the state finals in the discus in 2002. He was also recognized for outstanding contribution to the Performing Arts Department. \r\nKeglar enrolled at Purdue in 2003, appearing in the Arizona game on special teams, but suffered a right high ankle sprain that would sideline him the rest of the season. He took over weak-side outside linebacker chores in 2004, starting every game. He ranked fourth on the team with 61 tackles (38 solos) with four stops for losses, an interception and three pass deflections.\r\nAs a sophomore, Keglar appeared in 10 games, starting six at weak-side linebacker. He was suspended for the Penn State clash by the coaches after he and a teammate were horse-playing in the locker room after practice and the teammate suffered a concussion. Keglar still ranked fourth on the team with 50 tackles (30 solos), including a sack and three stops for losses. He also recovered a fumble and picked off a pass.\r\nKeglar registered 69 tackles (46 solos) with two stops behind the line of scrimmage while starting 10 of 14 contests in 2006. He caused and recovered a fumble, broke up five passes and intercepted another. He would close out his career with 70 tackles (39 solos), four stops for losses and three pass break-ups as a senior, starting all 13 games."

Langford is a dominant run stuffer who still needs to develop more pass-rush moves, but he has the size to clog rush lanes. He must develop better hand punch to help him combat isolated blocks and lacks ideal explosion to be much of an edge rusher, but like Warren, his ability to play a variety of roles and positions up front will help him earn a spot in a team's defensive rotation.",
                    "Negatives": "Lacks explosiveness off the snap, but uses his strength well to get through traffic, showing proper hand extension to keep blockers off his feet...Has the lower-body strength in his anchor vs. double teams, but he must show better faith in his hand placement to keep blockers off his body...Earlier in his career, he needed hard coaching, as he was not fond of the training room, but has matured over the years and takes pride in his captaincy...Has smaller-than-ideal hand size (eight inches), leading to problems in attempts to grab on to his opponent's jersey (has a tendency of not locking on when placing his hands on the blockers chest, giving up body surface coming off the snap)...Showed marked improvement in taking proper angles when shooting the inside gaps, but used to take a wide loop to compensate for a lack of explosion...Good at using his size to close down the backside, but is still developing a better feel for play action, as he will bite on them at times...Slow to shed when he fails to keep his hands active, but shows good urgency to close when he locates the ball, especially when he gets free from his initial blocker.\r",

Has improved using his long reach to secure and drag down the opponent...Generates good lower-body power behind his hits and has made steady improvement keeping his feet to drive the lead blocker back through the rush lane...Because of his run-stuffing skills, Langford could shift to defensive tackle in a 4-3 alignment to take advantage of one of his better skills... Has short-area pursuit speed to give chase down the line and with his change-of-direction agility and field vision, he is quick to redirect and neutralize the cutback lanes...Developed a fluid spin move to clear the line of scrimmage and can generate pressure from the backside (see 2007 Howard, Delaware State and Norfolk State and 2006 Delaware State, Norfolk State and Bethune-Cookman games)...More of a bull rusher who might be better served as a tackle, as he does a good job of working on the offensive guard's edge...Has change-of-direction agility, combined with his knowledge of taking proper angles to generate good production pressuring the pocket...Uses his reach in attempts to dislodge the ball from the ballcarrier...His forward body lean and hip swerve let him deliver the spin move to slip off blockers and he shows good agility and balance in pursuit...Can penetrate the gaps and mash the pocket on a consistent basis.\r"

                "Overview": "The reason the Pirates have been successful in recent years has been the play of their defensive, led by the unheralded Kendall Langford. During his freshman year, Hampton ranked 58th in the nation in total defense (251.17 yards per game), but improved to sixth nationally in 2005 (270.92 ypg) and 15th in the Division 1-AA ranks in '06 (271.5 ypg).\r\nLangford led Hampton in both sacks and tackles for losses as a sophomore and junior, when Hampton had success stopping the run. His dominance against the ground game stands out in his performances. In 234 running plays going directly at Langford during his career, the opposition managed only 63 yards, an average of 0.27 yards per attempt. In 47 games with the Pirates, the opposing team has produced just seven first-down runs on plays directed at Langford.\r\nAt Petersburg High School, Langford earned first-team All-District and second-team All-Metro and All-Region honors as a senior. He also added All-District first-team accolades during his junior campaign, competing as a defensive lineman.\r\nBecause of Hampton's lofty academic reputation, Langford decided to enroll at the university in 2004. Lining up at right defensive tackle as a true freshman, he earned Freshman All-American honors from the Gridiron Report. He appeared in all 12 games, forcing his way into the starting lineup for three of the team's final four contests. \r\nThat year, he made 44 tackles (15 solo), as he finished second on the squad with 4 1/2 sacks and 11 1/2 stops for losses. He was credited with seven quarterback pressures, a pass deflection and a blocked kick. He recovered a fumble that he returned 30 yards for a touchdown and also caused two fumbles.\r\nLangford shifted to left defensive end as a sophomore, garnering All-Mid Eastern Athletic Conference first-team honors. He started every game for a squad that ranked second in the nation in scoring defense, allowing only 14 points per game. He totaled 65 tackles (31 solo) and led the team with 15 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He posted 4 1/2 sacks, 12 pressures and three forced fumbles. He batted away two passes and blocked a pair of kicks.\r\nAs a junior, Langford again earned All-MEAC first-team honors, in addition to being named an All-American by The NFL Draft Report and the Sheridan Broadcasting Network. He moved to right defensive end in the team's new 3-4 alignment, finishing third on the team with 55 tackles (32 solo). He led a defense that ranked sixth nationally in scoring defense (14.5 points per game allowed), pacing the Pirates with eight sacks and 15 1/2 stops for losses. He was credited with eight pressures and two forced fumbles while blocking a kick and deflecting one pass.\r\nIn 2007, offenses made it a point to steer clear of Langford. Still, he managed to lead the team with a career-high 72 tackles (32 solo), ranking second on the squad with six sacks, 13 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage and 12 pressures in 11 games. He caused two fumbles, batted away a pass and returned an interception for a touchdown. He also blocked a field goal.\r\nIn 47 games at Hampton, Langford started 38 contests, including 35 as a defensive end. He recorded 236 tackles (110 solo) with 23 1/2 sacks for minus-175 yards, 56 1/2 stops for losses of 266 yards and 39 quarterback pressures. He caused nine fumbles and recovered another for a 30-yard touchdown return. He also deflected five passes, returned an interception 22 yards for a touchdown and was in on five of the 33 blocked kicks that Hampton produced during his four years with the team."

                "Overview": "Called the \"heart and soul\" of the Arizona defensive unit, opposing offensive coordinators feared the dominant and versatile defender. \r\nWhether lining up at outside linebacker in a 4-3 alignment or playing inside in a 5-2 formation, few teams could contain Larsen with just one blocker.\r\nThe two-time team captain made a triumphant return to the gridiron in 2005 after missing the previous two seasons while on a church mission. During his freshman year at Arizona in 2002, the new coaching staff considered his return as an added recruiting bonus. Opposing ballcarriers considered his return a nightmare for fullbacks trying to block him and halfbacks trying to elude him on end-around runs.\r\nAt Gilbert High School, Larsen earned Super Prep All-Farwest honors as a senior in 2001. He added Phoenix All-Metro Football accolades, along with Prep Star All-West and the Arizona Republic first-team Al-State recognition.\r\nIn his final season, the All-Region co-Defensive Most Valuable Player and All-Southeast Valley choice recorded 124 tackles as a linebacker and also competed as a quarterback. A multi-sport standout, he earned three letters in football, one in baseball and one in track.\r\nLarsen enrolled at the University of Arizona in 2002. He garnered Freshman All-American third-team and All-Pac-10 Conference Freshman first-team honors from The Gridiron Report and The Sports Page. He started seven of 12 games at weak-side linebacker in the team's eagle-flex system. He finished seventh on the team with 41 tackles (30 solo), adding a pair of sacks and 3 1/2 stops for losses. He added one quarterback pressure and deflected three passes.\r\nAlready recognized as the Wildcats' defensive leader and a favorite of the media, Larsen left the Arizona program for the 2003-04 seasons to serve on an LDS church mission to Chile. The only Mormon player on the Arizona football roster, many thought that Larsen would enroll at Brigham Young. \r\n\"Their recruiting coordinator told my high school coach I wasn't a Division I player,\" he says, smiling. \"But I never pictured myself at BYU. So many of the (Mormon) players from Phoenix go there. I wanted to go to a place where nobody knew me, a place where there was no one else like me.\"\r\nLarsen also found his future wife while away on his church mission. Ann, who attended nursing school at Central Arizona during Spencer's junior year with the Wildcats, attended Gilbert Highland High School with Spencer, although they did not date one another. When he moved to Tucson, she enrolled at Brigham Young. She wrote to Spencer while he was in Chile, but both were involved in somewhat serious relationships with other people.\r\nWhen Spencer returned in the spring of 2005, they connected and were married in December of that year and the couple welcomed their first son, Tyton, last April. The new coaching staff welcomed Larsen back to the program with open arms in 2005. \"I came back because the coaches told me they'd wait for me,\" he says. \"That kind of respect appealed to me. You can't beat that. Plus, I like it here. The guys probably saw me as some sort of square when I was a freshman. Now they probably see me as a regular guy. They know about my faith. I know about theirs. It works.\"\r\nOn the practice field during spring 2005 drills, Larsen suffered a right knee sprain (anterior cruciate ligament) in March, undergoing surgery to repair the injury a month later. That forced him to sit out the team's first two games and he saw limited action until taking over the middle linebacker spot for the team's last six contests. \r\nDespite starting just half of the schedule, he finished fourth on the team with 51 tackles (29 solo), a sack and 2 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He also recovered a fumble and batted away a pass. He also excelled in the classroom, earning Pac-10 Conference Academic second-team honors.\r\nIn 2006, Larsen was named All-Pac-10 Conference second-team adding Academic All-Pac-10 first-team and ESPN Academic All-District VII recognition. He started all 12 games for the Wildcats at \"Will\" linebacker, but also saw action in the middle. He went on to lead the team with 89 tackles (63 solo), coming up with two sacks, 10 1/2 stops for losses and three quarterback pressures. He caused three fumbles and recovered three others, returning two for a total of 10 yards. He deflected three passes and had his first career interception.\r\nServing as the team's captain for the second consecutive year, Larsen put together an All-American season in 2007. He led the team and Pac-10 while finishing 13th in the nation with a career-high 131 tackles (87 solo). He added four sacks and ranked third in the conference with a team-high 15 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He recovered four fumbles, caused three others and registered five quarterback pressures. He also deflected five passes and intercepted another.\r\nIn 44 games at Arizona, Larsen started 37 games. His 312 tackles (209 solo) rank 15th on the school's all-time record list. He added nine sacks for minus-62 yards and 32 stops for losses totaling 111 yards. He caused six fumbles and recovered eight others, returning four for a total of 27 yards. He also gained three yards on two interceptions and deflected 12 other tosses while collecting 10 quarterback pressures."

                "Overview": "Lichtensteiger's ability to excel at center or offensive guard is leading to comparisons to Jacksonville's Brad Meester. The Bowling Green team captain has a devastating hand punch and placement to consistently sustain his blocks and shows the nimble feet to get out in front consistently, neutralizing second-level defenders in the ground game.\r\nAt Crestview High School, Lichtensteiger earned All-Northwest Conference first-team honors as both an offensive and defensive lineman. He was selected that conference's Lineman of the Year as both a junior and senior. He was also named to the All-Ohio and All-District teams in each of his last two seasons and was chosen District Lineman of the Year in 2002.\r\nLichtensteiger registered 100 tackles with six sacks during his junior campaign. As a senior, he produced 125 more tackles, including eight sacks. He finished his career with four letters in both football and basketball. The talented lineman also performed in the weight categories for the school's track team.\r\nLichtensteiger enrolled at Bowling Green in 2003, spending that season performing on the scout team as a center. He shifted to offensive guard, starting all 12 games on the left side. He would go on to start all 44 games in which he appeared for the Falcons. As a freshman, he was named to the Football Writers' Association Freshman All-American team. He added All-Mid American Conference second-team honors, as he made 94 key blocks/knockdowns, including 15 that led to BGSU touchdowns, finishing with an 85.5% grade for blocking consistency.\r\nAs a sophomore, Lichtensteiger was again named to the All-MAC second-team. He helped the offense average 427.7 yards per game in total offense, as he started 11 times at left offensive guard. He paced the offensive line with 12 touchdown-resulting blocks, coming up with 90 key blocks en route to grading 84.36%.\r\nLichtensteiger shifted to center as a junior in 2006. He quickly acclimated to his new position, delivering 92 key blocks/knockdowns, with 10 of them leading to Falcons' touchdowns. He earned All-MAC first-team and Academic All-Conference honors and shared team MVP accolades with Devon Parks. Behind the center's trap blocks, the rushing attack led the conference, averaging 176.7 yards per game on the ground.\r\nAs a senior, Lichtensteiger registered 16 touchdown-resulting blocks through the team's first nine games. He posted 76 knockdowns and provided outstanding pass protection, as the Falcons improved their aerial attack to 300.1 yards per game from 169.1 yards the previous season.\r\nLichtensteiger boasts a string of 44 consecutive starts, lining up at left offensive guard for his first 23 games before shifting to center for the next 19 contests. He has collected 352 key blocks/knockdowns, including 53 that led to BGSU touchdowns. He delivered 28 of those blocks downfield and leads all of college football's active centers with a career blocking consistency grade of 85.45%."

He lacks the blazing speed you look for in an edge rusher and will struggle to shed blocks at times, but like the Packers standout, he has great field savvy, vision and determination. He knows when he needs to avoid blockers rather than try to overpower them, as he really doesn't have that blow-up strength (good, not great) to dominate, anyway. What he does is take good angles in pursuit and display excellent lateral range working down the line. In a scheme that will let him press the outside shoulder of an offensive tackle, he will have good success. With his pad level and in-line instincts, he could also earn quality minutes as a defensive tackle in a 4-3 alignment, but is more ideally suited to play defensive end in a 3-4 formation.",

When you've got one of the best players the school's ever had and he's only interested in helping the team win, it puts an exclamation point on what you're trying to do.\" Groh was amazed that Chris did not receive more Heisman Trophy consideration: \"If they're ever going to invite a defensive player to New York in December for the Heisman Trophy presentation, you'd have to think it was Chris Long.\"\r\nLong was well-known to college recruiters, especially after a stellar career at St. Anne's-Belfield School, where competed on both lines for the state champion squad. The Super Prep and Prep Star All-American received a four-star prospect rating from Rivals.com, a service that rated him the sixth-best defensive end in the prep ranks. Tom Lemming ranked him eighth in the country at defensive end and College Football News placed him 11th at that position.\r\nLong was a member of Rival.com's Atlantic East Amazing-80 team and he was an honorable mention All-South choice by the Orlando Sentinel. He was named 2003 Gatorade Player of the Year in Virginia and rated as the second-best player in Virginia by the Charlottesville Daily Progress \"Gold List,\" third by the Roanoke Times and fourth by Super Prep and Rivals.com. He was also a three-time first-team All-State selection on offense and defense.\r\nThe Central Virginia Defensive Player of the Year by the Daily Progress as a senior, Long was a three-time first-team All-Central Virginia defensive lineman by the Charlottesville Daily Progress and earned first-team All-Central Virginia honors his senior season as an offensive lineman as well. He was selected Conference Defensive Player of the Year his final two seasons and was selected Student Sports Junior All-American in 2002.\r\nLong registered 91 tackles (44 solos) as a senior to help lead his team to an undefeated season and the state championship, as he had 23 tackles for loss and 15 sacks that season. He also recorded 72 pancake blocks on offense. As a junior, he posted 85 tackles with 12 sacks and more than 20 tackles for loss. The three-time first-team All-Conference choice finished his career with 43 sacks and 66 tackles for loss. He also played basketball, lacrosse, and baseball during his high school career, winning the 2003 YMCA Slam Dunk Contest for high school students.\r\nLong would hold the rare distinction of having his jersey retired at St. Anne's Belfield School and also at the University of Virginia, where he played in six games during his freshman year in 2004. He posted five tackles with an 8-yard sack before being sidelined due to a bout of mononucleosis.\r\nAs a sophomore, Long took over right defensive end duties, starting all 12 games. He totaled 46 tackles (22 solos) with 1.5 sacks and had 7.5 stops for losses, along with 26 pressures and seven pass deflections in 752 plays. In 2006, he earned All-State honors, helping the team rank 17th in the nation, allowing just 289.5 yards per game in total offense. He collected 57 tackles (32 solos) with 4.5 sacks, adding 9.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage to go with 21 pressures in 715 defensive snaps.\r\nAs a senior, Long received countless postseason honors, including consensus first-team All-American and unanimous All-Atlantic Coast Conference first-team accolades. He ranked second on the team with 79 tackles (36 solos). The defensive captain tied for third in the nation with 14 sacks and was 14th nationally with 19 stops for losses. He had 23 pressures with an interception and nine pass deflections while blocking one kick and causing two fumbles.\r\nIn 43 games at Virginia, Long started 37 times. He recorded 187 tackles (93 solos) with 70 quarterback pressures, three forced fumbles, a 25-yard interception return and 17 pass deflections. He ranks tied for seventh in school history with 21 sacks for minus-171 yards and is sixth all-time in Virginia annals with 38 stops for losses totaling 211 yards. He also blocked one kick while participating in 2,432 defensive plays."

                    "Compares To": "JAMAAL BROWN-New Orleans...Like Brown, Long is a mauler with excellent drive-blocking skills. He compensates for a lack of explosion by taking good angles to adjust to movement and has the big hands and upper-body strength to consistently walk his man off the line. He shows the kick-step to mirror edge rushers, but does allow some inside penetration with his sluggish hip swerve working in-line. In a game plan that features physical drive blocking, Long is a perfect fit. But, if you put him in a zone-blocking formation, he lacks the lateral agility needed to mirror inside movement.",

                "Overview": "One of the most decorated offensive linemen in the storied history of the Michigan program, the two-time team captain became the first Wolverine and only the fourth player ever to garner Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year honors in consecutive seasons. \r\nBy doing so, Long joined Ohio State's Orlando Pace (1995-96) and Korey Stringer (1993-94) and Michigan State's Tony Mandarich (1987-88).\r\nThe senior offensive tackle gave Michigan three Offensive Lineman of the Year awards in the last four seasons, as David Baas was honored in 2004. Other Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year honorees from Michigan include guard Steve Hutchinson (2000) and tackles Jon Jansen (1998) and Greg Skrepenak (1991).\r\nEven though their hopes for a national title were dashed in an upset loss to Division 1-AA Appalachian State in their season opener, the Wolverines were grateful that their offensive leader returned to the playing field for the 2007 season. After his junior campaign, Long was seriously considering filing early for the NFL Draft. Being very close to tailback Mike Hart, both juniors made the decision to return for their final campaign.\r\n\"It was best for me and for the team to stay another year,\" Long said. \"I looked into it a little bit, but I never was close to leaving. I really want my degree, and we have unfinished business as a team.\" Apparently, Hart was prepared to follow Long into the NFL a year early, too. \"When we were making our decision last year, he came up to me and said if I'm leaving, then he's going to leave,'' Long said at the Big Ten Conference 2007 preseason convention.\r\n\"If I stay, then he's going to stay.'' As he spoke, Long glanced at the table in the Hyatt Regency Hotel meeting room where Hart was surrounded by reporters. \"You can't lose your right tackle (and) lose your left tackle and come back and have the same season you had the year before,'' Hart noted. \r\nMichigan coach Lloyd Carr admitted he had his doubts at a certain stage in the decision-making process. \r\n\"Jake Long, I thought at one point was going to leave. I always meet with the seniors the Monday after Ohio State to talk about what their plans are, because it impacts recruiting. Jake Long, on that day, he was undecided (whether to turn pro),'' Carr recalled. \"But when he came back, the first reason, he said, 'I'm just not ready to leave college and my teammates.' That speaks to who he is. How many guys would turn that down? ... Mike Hart, he never hesitated. Henne talked about graduating and a championship. You want guys like that.'' \r\nLong decided to protect himself financially in case he got hurt before the league's 2008 draft arrives. After getting guidance from recruiting coordinator Chris Singletary - who previously worked with the sports agent firm IMG - Long purchased an insurance policy. \"(I did it) just so I can go out there and not worry about getting injured,'' he said. \"I just go out there and focus on football and not worry about the repercussions of getting hurt.'' \r\nAt Lapeer East High School, Long was a three-year starter on the offensive line. He was  ranked the 17th-best player on the Detroit Free Press Best of the Midwest team and rated the 22nd-best offensive lineman in the nation by Collegefootballnews.com. Prep Football Report rated Long the 12th-best offensive tackle in the country and he was ranked as the 21st-best offensive tackle by Rivals100.com, who gave him a four-star prospect grade.\r\nMax Emfinger's Recruiting Service rated Long the nation's fifth-best offensive tackle, as he earned All-American and All-Midwest honors from Super Prep. He was ranked as the second-best player in Michigan on the Detroit News Blue Chip list and named to Prep Star's All-Midwest Region squad. He was also selected to the Detroit News, Detroit Free Press and Lansing State Journal Dream Team squads, as he became the first player in school history to earn All-State first-team honors.\r\nAn all-conference first-team offensive and defensive tackle as a junior and senior, he also earned All-State honorable mention as a junior. On offense, he did not allow any quarterback sacks in three seasons as a starter, grading over 90% for blocking consistency throughout his career. As a defensive tackle, he recorded 213 tackles with eleven sacks, 38 stops for losses and nine forced fumbles.\r\nLong posted 91 tackles with four sacks as a senior and delivered 72 tackles and four sacks during his junior season. He rushed for three touchdowns as a fullback during his junior campaign and added another touchdown as a senior. He also lettered in baseball as a first baseman, setting the school home run and RBI records as a junior. He was also the starting center on basketball team, as he broke the school record for shooting percentage during his junior year (62.3 percent).\r\nLong enrolled at Michigan with much fanfare in 2003, but was forced to spend the season on the scout team. He appeared in 12 games for the Wolverines in 2004. Even though he began his collegiate career as a reserve left tackle, he went on to start the final ten games at right tackle. He earned All-Big Ten Conference second-team honors from the league's coaches as a redshirt freshman. He also picked up Scripps/Football Writers Association of America, The Sporting News and Rivals.com Freshman All-American recognition.\r\nAs a sophomore, Long saw his 2005 season delayed by spring shoulder surgery. He missed the team's first seven games before returning in a reserve role at right tackle vs. Iowa. He would then move into the starting lineup for the Wolverines' final four contests, but was also hampered by foot and ankle injuries.\r\nFully recovered from shoulder problems, Long went on to establish himself among the nation's elite left offensive tackles in 2006. The team co-captain earned American Football Coaches Association, Walter Camp Football Foundation, Football Writers Association of America, Rivals.com and Sports Illustrated All-American first-team honors.\r\nNamed All-Big Ten and the league's Offensive Lineman of the Year, Long also picked up Hugh R. Rader Jr. Memorial Award honors (Michigan's top offensive lineman) and was a David Brandon Leadership Award co-recipient with LaMarr Woodley. The Outland Trophy and Lombardi Award candidate graded 87.0% for blocking consistency, as he allowed just two quarterback sacks and posted 128 knockdowns with 15 touchdown-resulting blocks for an offense that averaged 370.8 yards per game.\r\nHonors continued to pour in for Long throughout the 2007 season, as he again earned All-Big Ten Conference first-team and league Offensive Player of the Year accolades. He finished second in the voting for both the Outland Trophy and Lombardi Award, as he picked up consensus All-American first-team recognition. \r\nLong paced an offense that averaged 373.5 yards per game, despite key injuries that sidelined quarterback Chad Henne and running back Mike Hart for a good portion of the first half of the campaign. He would register 119 knockdowns with 18 touchdown-resulting blocks, leading Big Ten blockers with an 87.85% grade for blocking consistency. He would close out his career with 40 starting assignments, including a string of 30 consecutive starts."

When he gets his hands outside his frame in attempts to press, he can be beaten by the slot receivers working underneath (see 2007 Kansas State game)...Has adequate timed speed, but looks sluggish when he has to catch up to speedy receivers on deep routes (must develop a second gear)...Liability in run support, as he lacks the strength to face up to blockers...More of an ankle-biter than a wrap-up tackler, as he fails to stay in front of his man, preferring to take a side (bigger receivers have had great success playing off his hits)...Needs to do a better job of protecting himself in the open field, as he is very susceptible to the cut block...Must square up before delivering the tackle, as he tends to duck his head before contact, losing sight of his man (receivers get good separation when he does this working in space).\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a lean, but defined frame with adequate arm and shoulder muscle tone, small waist, good bubble, slender, but defined thighs and calves...Better cover man than a tackler, but will not shy away from contact...Has natural hands and very good timing on his leaps to get to the ball at its high point, also using his long reach effectively to get his hand up and over the receiver to deflect the pass...Shows good body control throughout his running stride and the hand-eye coordination to look the ball in over his outside shoulder...More quick than fast, but has the functional short-area burst to recover (can struggle to turn and drive on the ball when the receiver gets behind him; see 2007 Kansas State, Hawaii and Louisiana Tech games)...Has a keen knowledge of the playbook and is capable of making defensive calls in the secondary (coaches say he not only knows every assignment, but is the most \"field smart\" player on the team. Coach Tomey likens his awareness to that of the Ravens' Chris McAlister, who played for Tomey at Arizona)...Hard worker who puts in the extra hours training or in the film room to improve upon his weaknesses...Mature, quiet athlete with no known off-field issues...Has superb ball anticipation skills, especially when playing in zone, doing a good job of taking angles to close...Not the type that can get fooled on run action...Reacts with good urgency once he locates the ball and looks like a better fit at free safety than at corner, as he appears more comfortable keeping plays in front of him and anticipating throws in the zone than when going one-on-one with the receivers...Showed marked improvement in 2007, playing his responsibility first before flying to the ball (attacked the ball more often than staying on his man in 2006)...Closes quickly on plays in front of him, covering lots of ground in the short zone area (has good cover-2 skills, especially when in the loose third or in scheme coverage)...His vision lets him keep most of the action in front of him, as he easily locates the ball in flight, even with his back turned on the quarterback, as he is in good position to go up and get to the ball at its highest point...Keeps good body control combating for jump balls and seems to always be in the proper spot to break up or intercept the pass (27 passes defended in 25 games at SJSU and 46 passes defended in 40 games for his career)...Does a very good job of extending and catching the ball outside his frame, looking athletic in his leaps...His timing allows him to explode off the ground in attempts to reach the thrown ball, making good body adjustments to get to the off-target tosses.\r"

                "Overview": "A relative unknown when he arrived at San Jose State, following an outstanding career at Cabrillo College, Lowery made his mark as one of the top pass defenders in college football. A free safety at Cabrillo College, Lowery credits his experience at the position and special teams for his seamless adjustment to the cornerback position at the major college level. He became the first San Jose State player to earn All-American honors in consecutive seasons (2006-07).\r\nAt Soquel High School, Lowery was a two-time All-Santa Cruz Coast Athletic League pick as a defensive back, adding All-League accolades as a senior running back. He set school records with 23 rushing touchdowns and 25 total scores in 2003. That year, he set the county record with seven touchdowns vs. Sacred Heart of San Francisco High. In 20 games on defense, he intercepted a school-record 20 passes. Lowery also lettered in basketball. A three-year starter for the basketball team, he earned League Most Valuable Player honors as a junior. That year, he led his squad to the Central Coast Section Playoffs.\r\nLowery visited San Jose State, Purdue and Utah State during the recruiting period, but enrolled at Cabrillo College to improve his academic standing. As a freshman in 2003, he was named to the All-Nor Cal Combine Team, in addition to earning All-State and All-Coast Conference first-team honors. He led the junior college level with 237 yards gained on eight interceptions, returning two for scores. He averaged 30 yards on 10 kickoff returns, including one for a touchdown. He also scored on a blocked punt and a blocked field goal, adding 69 tackles (48 solos) with two fumble recoveries and six pass breakups.\r\nIn 2004, the free safety led the nation with 202 yards gained on five pass thefts through the first five games, but missed the rest of the season with a hand injury. He recorded 26 tackles (14 solos) and was named to the All-Nor Cal team, despite his injury.\r\nLowery arrived at San Jose State during fall camp with little fanfare, but quickly seized the left cornerback spot for new head coach Dick Tomey. He would go on to earn All-American and All-Western Conference honors, as he tied Idaho's Stanley Franks for the national lead with nine interceptions. He also deflected seven passes, delivered 48 tackles (23 solos) with three fumble recoveries and averaged 8.4 yards on five punt returns. The cornerback joined linebacker Dave Chaney (1971) as the only Spartans ever named to Playboy's prestigious All-American squad.\r\nDuring the next-to-last scrimmage of '07 spring drills, Lowery collided with running back Cameron Island, and suffered a fractured jaw. He had to have his mouth wired shut for seven weeks to help the healing process, losing more than 10 pounds during that time. As a senior, he also gained punt-return duties, ranking 14th in the nation with 273 yards and a touchdown on 19 attempts (14.37-yard average). The All-Western Athletic Conference defender collected 44 tackles (30 solos) with seven pass deflections and also came up with four interceptions. \r\nHe was named to the American Football Coaches Association All-American squad, becoming the school's first to be honored in consecutive seasons. Only three others before Lowery -- end Lloyd Thomas (1938), halfback LeRoy Zimmerman (1939) and linebacker Dave Chaney (1971) -- were named to one of the five nationally recognized All-American teams by the NCAA. Thomas, Zimmerman and Chaney were named Associated Press first-team All-American players in their respective senior seasons.\r\n\"It's an accomplishment for Dwight, our program and the Western Athletic Conference. The great thing for Dwight is he chose to stay in school to get further along towards his (bachelor's) degree and hone his skills for the next level. Certainly receiving this honor and recognition is very gratifying to him,\" said San Jose State head coach Dick Tomey, AFCA second vice-president. \"I'm really proud of him and the fact that he has been able to accomplish all of it in the framework of the team and trying to make our team better. And, I know he has a bright future in football.\"\r\n\"This is a tremendous honor. Right now, I'm at a loss for words,\" Lowery said when he first learned of the honor. \"Last year, it (an All-American performance) wasn't expected. So, it was easy to do the things I did. When you come back the next year, it's expected of you now. The things I did last year, people expect that now and I expect that of myself. The challenge is something that drove me this year. Maybe, there's somebody questioning whether last year was a fluke, or I got lucky. I love that challenge and I feel there are always ways you can get better as a person and as a football player. That's something that I embraced this year.\"\r\nAt Cabrillo College, Lowery played 15 games at free safety.

He has the arm strength to throw the option pass and can also earn playing time as a kickoff returner, but needs to work on ball-security issues after he had 15 fumbles in 2007, many of them on special teams.

                "Overview": "Darren McFadden, a two-time Heisman runner-up, is regarded as one of the finest players in college football in recent years and one of the best to come out of the University of Arkansas. \r\nThe two-time Doak Walker Award winner shattered numerous school and Southeastern Conference records during his three seasons at Arkansas, establishing himself as one of the league's elite all-time backs -- Herschel Walker of Georgia, Bo Jackson of Auburn and Emmitt Smith of Florida.\r\nMcFadden was often utilized as the quarterback in the \"Wildcat\" formation, dominating defenses with his running and passing. He shared the backfield with another 1,000-yard rusher and first-team All-American kick returner Felix Jones, as the duo formed the most potent running back tandem in the nation, helping the Razorbacks average 286.54 yards per game on the ground in 2007.\r\nIn 38 games as a Razorback, McFadden rushed for over 100 yards 22 times. By winning the Doak Walker Award in both 2006 and '07, he became just the third Arkansas player to ever garner national award recognition in the 112 years of the program, joining Bud Brooks (1954 Outland Trophy) and Loyd Phillips (1966 Outland Trophy). \r\nBy gaining 1,113 yards rushing in 2005, 1,647 in '06 and a school-record 1,830 yards in '07, McFadden joined Georgia's Herschel Walker (1980-82) as the only players in Southeastern Conference history to rush for over 1,000 yards as a freshman, sophomore and junior. He is also the second UA player to rush for 1,000 yards three times, joining Ben\r\nCowins (1976-78). McFadden is the first to do it in his first three seasons.\r\nAt Pulaski Oak Grove High School, McFadden became the only player from the state of Arkansas to be named to the Parade All-American team in 2004. The two-time All-State, All-Area and All-South choice was chosen the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette's Offensive Player of the Year as a senior and was also selected to that newspaper's All-Arkansas squad. \r\nMcFadden was ranked as the No. 23 prospect in the nation and the top prospect in Arkansas by Rivals.com. The organization also rated him as a five-star prospect and the third-best athlete in the country. Tom Lemming's Prep Football Report rated him as the eighth-best running back in the nation. He was ranked 21st on the Mobile Register's Super Southeast 120 listing. He was also listed 21st in The Dallas Morning News Top 100. He was among the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Super Southern 100 and participated in the 2005 Arkansas High School All-Star Game.\r\nMcFadden was tabbed as the Class 4A-Southeast Conference's Outstanding Back, as he racked up 1,965 yards and 27 touchdowns on 184 carries as a senior. He averaged 10.7 yards per carry and scored three or more rushing touchdowns in six games during his final campaign. He made three receptions for 67 yards and one score. He completed 6-of-15 passes for 75 yards and two touchdowns as a quarterback. He also returned nine punts for 370 yards and three touchdowns.\r\nAs a junior, McFadden rushed for a school-record 2,027 yards and 19 touchdowns on 204 carries. He averaged 9.9 yards per attempt, leading his squad to an 8-4 record and second-place finish in the Class 5-AAA Conference. He hauled in nine passes for 252 yards and two touchdowns as a junior. He also earned 103 yards on 12 punt returns. In his sophomore campaign, he rushed for 859 yards and 13 touchdowns on 109 carries. He hauled in 12 receptions for 333 yards and five scores. He also returned 10 punts for 82 yards and 14 kickoffs for 372 yards.\r\nMcFadden totaled 4,871 yards rushing on 497 attempts in his prep career and averaged 9.8 yards per carry. In addition to football, he was a standout in baseball and track and field in high school. He was also recruited by a host of other schools including Tennessee, Alabama, Nebraska, Auburn and Iowa, but decided to enroll at Arkansas after attending Houston Nutt's Football Camp as a junior.\r\nMcFadden's arrival at Arkansas was met with much fanfare and he certainly did not disappoint, setting school freshman rushing records with 1,113 yards and 11 scores on 176 carries (6.3-yard average) in 2005. He caught 14 passes for 52 yards, returned 12 kickoffs for 348 yards (29-yard avg) and averaged 137.5 all-purpose yards per game. \r\nHe earned All-American honorable mention from Pro Football Weekly and first-team fresh-man All-American accolades from the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), College Football News, ESPN.com, Rivals.com, Scout.com and The Sporting News. He was also named the Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Year by the Associated Press and the league's coaches.\r\nAs a sophomore, McFadden's rushing yardage total of 1,647 on 284 attempts (5.8-yard average) was more than that of 54 of the 119 Division I-A teams (45.4%), while his 14 rushing touchdowns were better than 43 teams nationally (36.1%). The consensus All-American was the recipient of the Doak Walker Award and finished second in the voting for the Heisman Trophy. He also had 11 receptions for 149 yards (13.5-yard average) and a score while completing 7-of-9 passes (77.8%) for 69 yards and three touchdowns. He averaged 26.2 yards with a score on ten kickoff returns and 147 all-purpose yards, scoring 98 points. He also rushed for over 100 yards eight times.\r\nMcFadden had an up-and-down junior campaign, but still garnered consensus All-American honors while again winning the Doak Walker Award and finishing second in the Heisman Trophy race. He gained over 100 yards rushing 10 times, as he broke his own school record with 1,830 yards and 16 touchdowns on 325 rushes (5.6-yard average). However, he did fumble the ball 15 times, with the opposition recovering five of them. He had 21 catches for 164 yards (7.8-yard average) and a score, hit on 6-of-11 throws (54.5%) for 123 yards and four touchdowns, scoring 102 points. He finished the season with 102 points scored and gained 2,310 all-purpose yards, an average of 177.69 yards per game.\r\nIn 38 games at Arkansas, McFadden carried 785 times for 4,590 yards (5.85-yard average) and 41 touchdowns. He grabbed 46 passes for 365 yards (7.9 avg) and two scores, as he also returned 38 kickoffs for 926 yards (24.4 avg) and a touchdown. He completed 14-of-22 passes (63.6%) for 205 yards, seven touchdowns and one interception while recording five solo tackles with a fumble recovery. \r\nMcFadden totaled 268 points with 44 overall touchdowns and amassed 5,881 all-purpose yards (154.76 yards per game). He ran for 100 or more yards in 22 games, but had 23 fumbles, losing nine."

                "Overview": "Offensive linemen usually spend their careers in relative anonymity, but NFL scouts' eyes were fixed on Pittsburgh's twin tackles during the 2007 season. \r\nOne of the most versatile blockers in the collegiate ranks, the talented right tackle has the nimble feet and slide to play left tackle, the short-area quickness and angle-blocking skill to lead on traps and sweeps as an offensive guard and the deep-snapping skills and hand quickness to possibly shift to center at the pro level.\r\nMcGlynn, a vocal leader of the Pitt front wall, shows great passion and desire on his 2006 film. His own coaches did not realize that he played a good portion of the season with a right hand injury and a torn labrum in his left shoulder that required surgery after the season. The shoulder surgery would force him to sit out 2007 spring drills. Still, he refused to come off the field, extending his string of starts to 31 straight games while appearing in 35 contests to date for Pittsburgh.\r\nMcGlynn lettered three times in football as a defensive end and offensive tackle at Austin-town Fitch High School. The All-Steel Valley selection was also a Super Prep All-Midwest and Prep Star All-Region choice. He was rated one of the state of Ohio's top 40 prep players by Rivals.com and was selected to play in the Big 33 Football Classic. He was limited to four games as a senior due to a right fibula fracture. He also lettered twice in baseball, adding All-Steel Valley accolades.\r\nMcGlynn enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh in 2003, spending the season performing on the scout team as an offensive tackle. He was the recipient of the 2004 Ed Conway Award, given to the team's Most Improved Player, as he played in all 12 games. His stellar play in reserve early in the season saw the coaching staff insert him into the starting lineup at right offensive tackle ahead of senior Dale Williams for the final eight games of the 2004 season. He also served as the Panthers' snapper on placement kicks.\r\nThe 2005 season was a virtual repeat of '04, as McGlynn again was chosen for the Ed Conway Award, continuing to show vast improvement blocking from his right tackle position. That year, he graded 82.9% for blocking consistency with 69 key blocks, including nine that resulted in touchdowns. He also continued performing as the team's long snapper for field goals and extra points.\r\nAs a junior, McGlynn's performance level continued to improve. Despite injuries that limited him the second half of the year, he graded 84.3% for blocking consistency, provided key blocks on 16 scoring drives and delivered 86 knockdowns. He did not allow any quarterback pressures for the season and gave up sacks in only one game.\r\nIn 2007, McGlynn shifted to right offensive guard for the first three games, but his replacement at right tackle struggled and the coaches moved him back to his original position after the Michigan State game. He saw limited action in the season opener vs. Eastern Michigan while still recovering from his '06 shoulder injury, but finished the season with 100 knockdowns/key blocks, including 17 resulting in touchdowns while making 13 more blocks downfield."

                "Overview": "A member of the Bednarik Award, Lombardi Award and Outland Trophy watch lists in 2007, the three-time All-Big 12 Conference selection is a big, strong and explosive run defender who anchored the Longhorns' defensive line from his strong-side defensive tackle position the last three years. While the team's pass defense struggled the last two years since Texas won its national championship, Okam's dominance in the middle has seen the Longhorns rank sixth in rush defense in 2007 (93.38 ypg) and finish third nationally in 2006 (61.15 ypg).\r\nDominating the action in the trenches is the main reason Texas heavily recruited Okam coming out of Lake Highlands High School, where the versatile athlete earned Class 5A All-State recognition in both football and track-&-field. He was a Parade All-American choice as a senior and a two-time first-team All-District selection. He was chosen first-team 5A All-State honors by the Associated Press and tabbed first-team All-District 9-5A as a senior. He also played in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl.\r\nOkam posted 170 tackles, seven sacks, 14 stops for losses, five forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, 11 quarterback pressures, one blocked kick and five pass break-ups during his career. He registered 56 tackles (31 solos), four sacks, eight stops behind the line of scrimmage, two forced fumbles, one fumble recovery, three pressures, one blocked kick and four pass deflections in helping his team limit opponents to just 215.7 total yards per game in 2003.\r\nOkam added first-team All-District honors after recording 61 tackles, three sacks and five stops for losses as a junior. His team was 6-5 and earned a spot in the state playoffs that season. He earned All-District recognition and was a starter on the defensive line as a sophomore, registering 53 stops. In track, he finished fifth at the 2003 Texas 5A state meet in the discus (174-6).\r\nOkam made an immediate contribution to the Texas defensive line as a true freshman in 2004, earning Freshman All-American honors while playing in 12 games behind Rodrique Wright at left defensive tackle. He earned his first career start vs. Baylor and finished his first campaign with 22 tackles (11 solos), two sacks and six stops for losses. He recovered a fumble, deflected five passes and had nine quarterback pressures.\r\nAs a sophomore, Okam garnered All-Big 12 Conference second-team honors, as he started all 13 games at strong-side defensive tackle. He helped the team capture the national championship, as the Longhorns' defense ranked 10th in the country, giving up just 302.92 yards per game. He went on to post 48 tackles (23 solos), a sack, five stops behind the line of scrimmage and 11 pressures. He recovered two fumbles, including one in the end zone for a touchdown and batted down two passes.\r\nA Playboy All-American preseason selection in 2006, Okam was slowed earlier in the year by a knee injury that forced him to sit out the Baylor game. He earned All-Big 12 honorable mention for 12 starts at strong-side tackle. He delivered 38 tackles (22 solos), two sacks, six stops for losses and 10 pressures while recovering one fumble.\r\nOkam seriously considered entering the 2007 NFL Draft and bypassing his senior season, but decided that it was best that he return to school. \"Looking at all of the things I've done in college, there are some of the goals I still haven't reached,\" Okam said. \"One of the main goals is to get my degree, and I'm on schedule to do that in December. You also take into account your fans and being a good role model to other young student-athletes to let them know education is important by staying in school that extra year and graduating. I'm still enjoying the college life, the University of Texas has been good to me, and I want to finish my football career with a good senior year and have my degree, as well.\"\r\nVoted a captain by his teammates, Okam earned one of the Dr. Nasser Al-Rashid Strength & Conditioning Awards and was named one of UT's Outstanding Defensive Linemen. He picked up first-team All-Big 12 and Academic All-Big 12 honors as a senior in 2007, starting all 13 games. He recorded a career-high 52 tackles (25 solos) with five sacks and 11 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He generated 16 pressures with five pass deflections, a fumble recovery and a forced fumble."

He needs to be more consistent shooting his hands in attempts to battle counter moves and struggles to adjust when working on the edge.

He can play like an all-world prospect one game (see 2007 vs. Chris Long-Virginia and George Selvie-South Florida), but at other times, he can self destruct when facing speedy edge rushers with an array of counter moves (see 2007 Michigan State, Louisville and Rutgers games).",

He might be a better fit on the right side...Has questionable toughness and plays with inconsistent aggression...Shows adequate foot quickness to get off the ball, but can be late at times and will get lazy playing on his feet and struggles to bounce back up when cut...Has good natural strength, but displays marginal pop in his punch and poor explosion, as he fails to consistently sink his weight (waist bender) and is prone to getting too high in his stance coming off the line...Has adequate feet to sustain blocks, but struggles with too much room, as he has poor slide and mirror agility...Adequate as a run blocker because of his size, but struggles to get out in front when pulling. He can get in front in the short area, but fails to keep his feet running long distances, especially when playing in space because of his lower-body stiffness...Does an adequate job of getting his hands on outside linebackers, but struggles in space on screens and draws when he fails to generate good power behind his punch...Has functional feet for a left tackle, but struggles when defensive ends cross his face and needs to be more active with his hands...Lacks the hip snap to readjust to counter moves and struggles vs. the speed rush, as he lacks the balance to mirror defenders coming off the edge.\r",

He follows a lineage of accomplished athletes at the center position in recent years for the Sun Devils, including All-Pac-10 Conference honorees Grayling Love, Drew Hodgdon and Scott Peters.\r\nThe versatile and powerful interior lineman performed extremely well and was named to the 2007 Rimington Trophy Watch List, an award annually presented to the nation's top center. He was awarded the Tim Landers Iron Man Award, given to the Sun Devil with exemplary work ethic in the weight room, on the field or in the community. Pollak also won the Cecil Bono Team Captain Award and the Pat Tillman Award at the end of his collegiate career. He excelled in the classroom, where he was one of eight Sun Devils on the 2007 roster and one of five ASU offensive linemen to have earned his undergraduate degree prior to his final season.\r\nPollak attended Corona del Sol High School, where he earned two votes in The Long Beach Press-Telegram's \"Best In The West\" rating. He was a member of The Tacoma News Tribune's \"Western 100\" and rated as the eighth-best prospect in the state of Arizona by Super Prep. He added All-Region honors from Prep Star and ranked as the sixth-best offensive lineman in the West by PacWestFootball.com.\r\nPollak was named first-team All-Arizona by The Arizona Republic, as he also collected first-team All-City and All-Conference recognition as a senior. That year, he graded 92% for pass blocking, 86% for run blocking and generated 67 knockdowns, picking up Super All-State first-team honors on offense from the Phoenix Metro Football Magazine.\r\nThe versatile lineman played offensive guard and defensive tackle, but had not played football before coming to Corona. He was also a standout baseball pitcher, earning first-team All-Region, All-East Valley, All-Conference and honorable mention All-State accolades as a junior, playing three seasons on the baseball diamond. He also served as the captain of his baseball and football teams.\r\nPollak enrolled at Arizona State in 2003, spending the season competing on the scout team as an offensive guard and center. When All-Pac-10 center Drew Hodgdon was injured in fall camp, Pollak stepped in and started the team's first four games at center. He contributed to a passing offense that led the Pac-10 and ranked fifth in the nation with an average of 317.3 yards per game.\r\nAs a sophomore, Pollak played in all 12 games, starting the team's final five contests (started six total) for All-Pac-10 honoree Grayling Love, who was sidelined due to an injury. In the games in which he started, ASU averaged 510.7 yards per game in total offense and scored an average of 36.0 points per game.\r\nIn 2006, Pollak was named All-Pac-10 Conference second-team. He was chosen the team's Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman and earned Hard Hat Player honors for his efforts in the team's offseason strength and conditioning program for the third-straight season. With him in the pivot, ASU averaged 367.3 yards per game in total offense.\r\nThe Sun Devils won their first eight games under new head coach Dennis Erickson, as Pollak garnered first-team All-Pac-10 Conference honors. He allowed four of the team's 55 quarterback sacks, but generally did a steady job of protecting QB Rudy Carpenter in the pocket. ASU would go on to average 399.6 yards per game.

When he gets too tall in his pads, he struggles to shed and stack, causing him to lose some battles in attempts to play off those blocks...Needs to be more consistent shooting his hands, as he tends to lean and give a shoulder rather than extending to play off the blocks, causing him to get washed out some vs. the more active and bigger blockers...Has the timed speed to slip through the pile and apply pressure, but his adequate change-of-direction agility sees him labor at times when he has to get in gear when working in space..Must show better hip flexibility and lateral movement in his backside pursuit before he can be given more opportunities to rush the passer.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a large frame with thick thighs and calves...Possesses solid muscle tone in his lower body, with wide hips, broad shoulders and good muscle tone in his arms...Has room on his frame to add another 15 pounds of bulk without having it affect his balance or quickness...Has a strong lower body, with very good hip width...Shows good straight-line speed and explosion off the snap and does a solid job of keeping his hands inside his frame to lock on and control the blockers... Displays the lower-leg drive to split double teams and the short-area burst to close on the pocket...When he hits the gaps with his pad level down and is very good at slipping off blocks to plug the rush lanes...When he stays low in his pads, he consistently gains leverage (4.35 20-yard shuttle), as he has the flexibility and change-of-direction agility to generate good acceleration in his short-area burst...Can wear down the blockers with his leg drive and combative nature, as he shoots the gaps with good explosion and is the type that plays until the whistle, combining strength and explosive hand punch...Can gain an advantage and shows suddenness getting to the gaps due to his savvy play and anticipation skills (see 2007 Ohio University, Clemson, Boston College and 2006 North Carolina, Southern Mississippi and Virginia games)...Disruptive force in the gaps, excelling at pushing the lead blocker back to clog the rushing lanes (held opponents to minus-13 yards rushing on 106 running plays)...Strong inside run stuffer who can make plays up and down the line due to his lateral movement...Knows how to get underneath to get a piece of the blocker's pads and is very effective stacking and controling in one-on-one situations...Won't stay blocked for long when he keeps his hands active and inside his frame...Has a very strong hand punch to shock and jolt and showed vast improvement keeping his hands inside his frame in 2006...Relies more on his strength than hand placement to defeat a block, but when he is able to generate quick hand technique, he has an effective arm crossover move as a bull rusher to push the pocket...Has a good feel for playing off blocks and reacts well to block pressure...Has that explosive short-area burst to clog the rush lanes, and when he keeps his hands active, he can grab, turn, push and control the offensive linemen...When he stays low in his pads and extends his arms, he is very effective...Has the quickness to take good angles, slant and make plays down the line...Strong inside run defender who might not show the lateral range to make plays in long pursuit, but is very efficient when asked to clog the lanes between the tackles...More of a pocket-pressure type than a pass rusher, as he plays in a system that relies on him providing containment rather than generate pressure, but once he clears the lane, he shows good urgency and the ability to take angles in attempts to close...Could surprise as a pass rusher, as he shows the quick initial step to get advantage and also get on the edge of a blocker...Has effective swim-and-rip ability and good suddenness off the ball and he is more of a power-oriented type than one who would finesse...Does a good job of keeping eye contact on the quarterback to provide containment (see 2007 Clemson, Florida State and Miami and 2006 Cincinnati, Southern Mississippi and Kent State games) and has developed efficient spin moves to counter and pull away from double-team activity...Plays with good instincts, awareness and recognition, as it is rare to see him bite on play action or misdirection...Has a good feel for blocks and when he plants his feet in the ground, even double teams struggle to contain him.\r"

                "Overview": "A number of Virginia Tech outside linebackers and defensive ends have had success over the years. Oftentimes, the tireless work of the defensive tackles who constantly took on multiple blockers in order to free up their teammates to make the big plays have been overshadowed. \r\nBecause of the constant multiple coverage that they face, the Hokies' defensive tackles do not have eye-opening statistics, but head coach Frank Beamer has noted the need for his defensive tackles to dominate vs. the inside running game.\r\nWhile Tech has produced quality run-stuffing tackles in recent seasons, none has shown the ability to simply shut down the opposition's ground game the way Carlton Powell, Jr. can. \r\nHow dominant has Powell been? In 73 plays that he made vs. the run, he held the opponent to minus-21 yards rushing. Since Powell was inserted into the starting lineup, Tech has led the nation in total defense the last two years (2005-06) and led the Division 1-A ranks in scoring defense in 2006, after placing second the previous two seasons.\r\nA prep inside linebacker during his first three years at Great Bridge High School, Powell shifted to defensive tackle as a senior while also competing on the offensive line. The All-Atlantic Region choice by Prep Star battled injuries during his final campaign, but still managed to registered 60 tackles, five sacks, five fumble recoveries and a blocked punt. As a junior, he totaled 80 tackles with seven sacks and 15 stops behind the line of scrimmage.\r\nPowell added honorable mention All-Eastern Region accolades and received a three-star prospect rating from Rivals.com. He was rated the 24th-best player in Virginia by The Roanoke Times and the state's 15th-ranked prospect by Super Prep. He was also a member of Tom Lemming's Prep Football Report All-Mid Atlantic team. He was a standout weight performer on the school's track team, finishing seventh in the Group AAA outdoor shot put competition as a senior.\r\nPowell enrolled at Virginia Tech in 2003, turning down scholarship offers from Maryland, East Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. He spent his first season at Tech competing on the scout team. In 2004, he appeared in 13 games as part of the team's defensive tackle rotation. He registered 17 tackles (seven solo) with 7 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage, six quarterback pressures and a pass deflection. In 19 plays vs. the run, he held the opponent to minus-17 yards rushing.\r\nAs a sophomore, Powell started five of 12 games at defensive tackle, missing the Duke game after spraining his ankle vs. North Carolina State in the season opener. He made 13 tackles (three solo) with an assisted sack and 1 1/2 stops for losses. But, those statistics don't tell the story. Twelve of those tackles came vs. the run, as he held the opposition to minus-7 yards on those plays.\r\nIn 2006, Powell was firmly entrenched as the starter at left defensive tackle. He recorded a career-high 38 tackles (16 solo) with 2 1/2 sacks, 6 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage and seven pressures. He also recovered a fumble and deflected a pass. With increased playing time, he also improved his dominance vs. the ground game. In 39 running plays directed at him, Powell held firmly, as the opponent was held to minus-2 yards rushing.\r\nThe defensive tackle started 12 of the team's 13 games in 2007. He posted 36 tackles (nine solo) with 2 1/2 sacks, six stops for losses and 15 quarterback pressures. He also forced a fumble. \r\nIn 51 games at Virginia Tech, Powell started 31 contests. He recorded 104 tackles (35 solo) with 5 1/2 sacks for minus 40 yards, 21 1/2 stops for losses of 75 yards and 30 quarterback pressures. He recovered two fumbles, caused three others and deflected a pair of passes. In 106 running plays directed at him, Powell's tackles resulted in the opposition in being held to minus-13 yards on the ground."

                "Overview": "Professional scouts flocked to Northern Iowa to see what many feel is the NCAA Subdivision's premier draft prospect in 2007. One of the most dominant left tackles in the game, Rinehart anchored the Panthers' offensive line since moving into the lineup as a freshman.\r\nThe decorated blocker is equally proficient in opening holes for the ground game or sliding back to protect the quarterback's blind side in passing situations. With Rinehart at left tackle, Northern Iowa has averaged over 400 yards per game in total offense (410.84 yards per game) over the last three seasons. The team ranked 10th in rushing (219.36 yards per game) and fourth in total offense (408.27 ypg) during his junior year.\r\nAt Boone High School, Rinehart was a standout offensive lineman. He earned All-State second-team honors as both a junior and senior. He was also a first-team All-District and All-Conference choice during his final two seasons. Rinehart also starred for the track team, qualifying for the state finals in the discus.\r\nPursued by the Naval Academy, Rinehart decided to enroll at Northern Iowa. He spent the 2003 season competing as an offensive tackle on the scout team. In 2004, he took over at left tackle, starting the team's first five games before undergoing a laparoscopic appendectomy on October 21. He missed three games while recovering before returning to the field as a reserve for the team's final three contests. He finished his first season with the team with an 87.57% grade for blocking consistency, delivering four touchdown-resulting blocks in the process.\r\nRinehart began to establish his dominance in the trenches as a sophomore in 2005. He earned All-Gateway Conference first-team honors and was a second-team All-Northwest Region choice by Football Gazette. He completely manhandled his opponents, coming up with 134 knockdowns, including 13 touchdown-resulting blocks and an impressive 17 blocks downfield. He registered an 87.13% grade for blocking consistency, helping the team average 236.8 yards per game passing and 400.53 yards in total offense.\r\nRinehart garnered Associated Press and Sports Network All-American second-team honors in 2006. He was an All-Gateway Conference and All-Northwest Region first-team choice and earned his third Gateway Offensive Lineman of the Week honors during his junior campaign. \r\nHe helped a unit that ranked fourth nationally in total offense with an average of 408.27 yards per game and ranked 10th in the Division 1-AA ranks with an average of 219.36 yards per game on the ground. He delivered 105 knockdowns in 11 games, producing 17 touchdown-resulting blocks and 15 more blocks downfield. He held his opponents to just three stops behind the line of scrimmage and a total of 14 tackles (10 solo), as he led the 1-AA linemen with an 89.64% grade for blocking consistency.\r\nAs a senior, Rinehart was a consensus All-American first-team and unanimous All-Gateway Conference first-team selection. He continued his dominance, as he graded 88.64% for blocking consistency, the highest mark of any offensive lineman in the FCS ranks. He collected 103 knockdowns with 17 touchdown-resulting blocks and 12 blocks downfield. The offense responded to his blocking by averaging 457.3 yards per game, an improvement of close to 50 yards per game from the previous season."

He is not the most instinctive open-field tackler and seemed to be favoring his nagging ankle problems, thus limiting his range and pursuit skills. Five tackles behind the line of scrimmage do not warrant first-team All-American honors. He has the frame that you look for in an outside linebacker, along with the quickness, but there are legitimate questions as to whether he has the valid instincts or lower body power to be an every-down player. Like Bell, he can make the big play, but there needs to be more consistency in his play. With a marginal feel for the passing game, especially when working in the zone, the jury is out on this guy, much like it has been on Bell since earlier in his career.

He is very fluid in his movements when dropping back in pass coverage, so much so that the coaches even utilized him at safety in various zone coverage packages. \r\nRivers' ability to play a variety of positions proved invaluable earlier in his career. In addition to excelling at weak-side linebacker, he was often used as a defensive end in pass rushing situations during his first two seasons with the Trojans. He also played through nagging left ankle problems in 2007, but still performed at a high level to garner All-American honors.\r\nAt Lake Mary High School, Rivers earned USA Today All-USA first-team, Parade, Super Prep, Prep Star, EA Sports and Insiders.com All-American first-team honors. He was a member of the Super Prep Elite 50, Prep Star Top 100 Dream Team, Lemming Top 100, Super Prep All-Dixie, Prep Star All-Southeast and Fox Sports Net All-South squads.\r\nThe Gatorade Florida Player of the Year and Florida Class 6A Mr. Football runner-up as a senior linebacker, Rivers recorded 111 tackles, 14 stops for losses, two sacks and a pair of interceptions in 2003.

He made All-State as a sophomore in 2001 when he had 100-plus tackles.\r\nBorn in Riverside, California, Rivers enrolled at Southern California in 2004. He saw significant playing time in 13 games as a reserve weak-side linebacker and was also used as a defensive end in pass rushing situations. He went on to record 25 tackles (13 solos) with 2.5 sacks and three stops for losses. He picked off one pass, deflected another and caused a fumble, as he was awarded All-Pac 10 Conference Freshman Team honors.\r\nRivers earned All-Pac 10 honorable mention while starting 11 games at weak-side linebacker in 2005. He sat out the Stanford and UCLA games with a nagging hamstring problem, but still delivered 52 tackles (35 solos) with a sack and three stops behind the line of scrimmage. He had the second interception for his career and also recovered a pair of fumbles.\r\nThe All-Pac 10 first-team pick added All-American honorable mention while receiving the team's Bob Chandler Award in 2006. He started all 13 games, leading the team with 85 tackles (47 solos), including two sacks and 7.5 stops for losses. He caused three fumbles, recovered another and batted away two passes.\r\nArthroscopic left ankle surgery in spring camp hampered Rivers' off-season conditioning program in 2007 and he later missed the Arizona State clash while nursing that sore ankle, but he still received All-American and All-Pac 10 Conference first-team honors. He started 11 of 12 games, but the ankle injury limited his range, as he had just five stops behind the line of scrimmage.

He finished with 240 tackles (139 solos), 5.5 sacks for minus-42 yards and 18.5 stops for losses of 77 yards. He was credited with three quarterback pressures and gained 36 yards on two interception returns while also deflecting seven passes. He caused five fumbles and recovered six others."

Even though he has the speed to stay with receivers deep, he gets a bit reckless in his press-coverage technique and must do a better job of keeping his hands inside the frame when attempting to jam his opponent at the line of scrimmage. He added kickoff returner to his resume as a senior, but needs to be more conscious of securing the ball. Like Newman, he will utilize his quickness to excel in man coverage, but he needs to do a better job as a tackler, as he appears to be an ankle-biter rather than a face-up, wrap-up tackler.",
                    "Negatives": "Does get a bit reckless in his play, resulting in costly penalties...Flagged three times in the first two games of 2006 for pass interference, and will get overconfident in his press-coverage skills, which isn't necessarily a weakness...Needs to do a better job of securing the ball on kickoff returns (had two costly fumbles in 2007)...Very effective in press coverage, but when he spends too much time attacking his man rather than playing off, he does not always anticipate the quarterback's moves...Shows urgency closing on the ball in man coverage, but sometimes rounds his angle to the ball after planting...Has natural hands, but you would like to see him use his incredible leaping ability more in attempts to break up or intercept the ball (needs to time his leaps in order to get to the ball at its highest point)...Must use his hands better to keep blockers away from his chest when trying to slip blocks working in trash...Does not work well vs. combo blocks, making him only adequate in filling the alleys...Easily engulfed when trying to slip past blocks in close quarters...Adequate tackler who will ankle bite at times rather than take on ball carriers head on...Will uncoil, but does a poor job of wrapping up...Has good closing speed, but when playing in the zone, he can get caught out of position when peeking into the backfield too long...As a senior, he struggled some with his jam technique as hands got outside his frame, but did compensate with good closing quickness...In the open field, he failed to face up as a tackler and looked sloppy breaking down his final year (see 2007 Southern and Eastern Kentucky games.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a tall, well-built frame with long arms, thick thighs and calves, tight abdomen and a frame that can carry additional bulk if he's moved to free safety at the next level...His range and fluid hips might make him a better fit at free safety at the next level, as his explosive closing burst reminds many of Philadelphia's Brian Dawkins...

                "Overview": "Not since Aeneas Williams terrorized receivers at Southern University (1987-90) has a Division 1-AA cornerback dominated like Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. \r\nThrust into the starting lineup midway through his freshman campaign, the speedy defender has shown exceptional shutdown ability and displayed the natural hands needed to excel as an interceptor. He also excelled as a kickoff returner and saw action as a receiver during his senior campaign.\r\nIn 39 starts for the Tigers, opposing quarterbacks completed just 55 of 161 passes (34.16%) thrown in Rodgers-Cromartie's immediate area. He intercepted 11 of those throws, deflected 25 and held the opposition to a miniscule 3.54 yards per pass attempt, the best of any collegiate defensive back over the last three seasons.\r\nIn addition to his stellar play, Rodgers-Cromartie has also been a standout performer for the TSU track team. Despite juggling football spring drills with the indoor and outdoor track seasons in 2007, he qualified for the NCAA Mid-East Regionals after he captured the Ohio Valley Conference long jump title (25' 0.75\"). In only his second outdoor event, he was named OVC Male Athlete of the Week after finishing third at the Penn Relays with a conference-best long jump of 24'10\".\r\nDuring the OVC Indoor Track Championships, Rodgers-Cromartie was name the top male athlete with a sensational performance. He won the 60-meter dash (6.89), long jump (25' 0.75\") and high jump (6' 9.5\") and finished second in the triple-jump (48' 8\"). What made those finishes even more impressive was the fact that he performed most of the indoor season while nursing an ankle sprain.\r\nExcelling in two sports is nothing new for Rodgers-Cromartie. The All-Area and All-District defensive back and wide receiver at Lakewood Ranch High School was regarded as one of the best cornerbacks in the South, receiving a four-star rating from Rivals.com. The High School Recruiting Report named him the most underrated prospect in the state of Florida. He also competed as a jumper and sprinter on the track team.\r\nRodgers-Cromartie enrolled at Tennessee State, where he shared playing time with Aaron Strong for the first half of the 2004 campaign. He would go on to start six games at strong-side cornerback, including the last five games. He posted 33 tackles (22 solo) with a stop for a loss while recovering two fumbles, returning one for a touchdown. Named the Ohio Valley Conference Defensive Newcomer of the Year by The Gridiron Report, he also batted away three passes and returned both of his interceptions for touchdowns. He blocked a punt for an 11-yard return and also had a 19-yard kickoff return.\r\nAs a sophomore, Rodgers-Cromartie started every game. He ranked fifth on the team with 41 tackles (34 solo), including three stops behind the line of scrimmage. He deflected five passes, intercepted another and returned a blocked punt 17 yards. He also gained 34 yards on two kickoff returns and caught one pass for eight yards in brief action as a receiver. He allowed just 1.86 yards per pass attempt, the lowest total by a Division 1-AA defender in a season since Aeneas Williams averaged 1.99 yards (on 58 throws) for Southern University in 1990.\r\nThe junior defender ranked third in the nation and led the OVC with six interceptions in 2006. He finished fourth on the squad with 47 tackles (37 solo) and two stops for losses. He also blocked two kicks and had seven pass deflections, earning first-team All-OVC and All-American honors. He allowed just 3.64 yards per pass attempt, the best figure in the Division 1-AA ranks for the second consecutive year. \r\nIn 2007, Rodgers-Cromartie earned third-team All-American honors from The NFL Draft Report. He added All-Ohio Valley Conference first-team accolades for the second straight year, as he was used not only on defense, but also handled kickoff returns while seeing brief action on offense. He recorded 37 tackles (28 solo) with two stops for losses and a pair of fumble recoveries. He deflected 11 passes and picked off two others, returning both interceptions for touchdowns. He also blocked four punts, gained 38 yards on a reception, 16 yards on four punt returns and 16 yards on two carries, finishing his final campaign with 1,016 all-purpose yards.\r\nIn 44 games at Tennessee State, Rodgers-Cromartie started 39 times. He recorded 158 tackles (121 solo) with eight stops for losses of 30 yards, adding 14 more tackles on the kick-coverage units. He recovered four fumbles, returning one for a touchdown and blocked eight kicks. He deflected 26 passes and intercepted 11 others for 314 yards (28.5-yard average) in returns with four touchdowns. \r\nRodgers-Cromartie also had two receptions for 46 yards, two carries for 16 yards and six punt returns for 44 yards (7.3-yard average). He added 859 yards on 36 kickoff returns (23.9 avg). Of the 161 passes thrown into his territory, the opposition managed to catch just 55 balls (34.16 completion percentage) for 620 yards and three touchdowns. He allowed just 3.85 yards per pass attempt during his career with the Tigers."

                    "Compares To": "TONY SCHEFFLER-Denver...Neither will ever be known for blocking skills, but both have rare speed for the position and are valid deep threats, especially when playing in motion. Rucker lacks the strength or desire to be an efficient blocker, the most glaring negative in his resume, but he is good at using his foot speed to clear the line and separate from second-level defenders. He is still a bit immature in his training regimen and needs to show better dedication to improving his weaknesses, as he is the type that will need to be monitored. He has that wide receiver's psyche, which is good if you are in a vertical passing attack. However, until he shows better dedication in the weight room and more urgency to block, he can't be considered anything more than a quality receiver who is better off as an H-back or playing in motion, not a classic tight end.",
                    "Negatives": "Still needs to mature off the field and show better dedication to training and the weight room...Fun-loving type, a bit spoiled, but is all business on the football field...Needs to dedicate the hours needed to improve his overall strength...Appears to be a bit stiff when trying to redirect, lacking loose hips, but compensates with good body control, especially when moving in space...Is a liability as a blocker, lacking the power and most importantly, the desire to face up to the more physical defenders...Has good timed speed, but lacks the explosive initial step to surprise a lethargic defender...Can be a bit late off the line of scrimmage and seems to lack the vertical skills to separate...On his shorter routes, he often lets the ball into his body, but he appears natural getting to the quarterback's quick slant...Lacks the fluid moves to adjust to the ball in flight and will struggle some to get to passes thrown behind him...After the catch, he does not have the elusive moves to escape and with his adequate power base, he won't break many tackles (goes down easier than expected vs. a bigger defender)...Gets too lackadaisical in his approach when taking on linebackers blocking in the second level -- takes good angles, but the urgency is not there...Smart, instinctive player who takes plays from the chalkboard to the playing field, but is a marginal student due to a lack of desire, not learning problems...Better prospect in a system that moves him around a lot, as he lacks the strength to be a physical tight end, especially when asked to block in pass protection or the ground game and is a better fit as an H-Back than a classic \"Y\" receiver...Needs to post up with his body better on deep routes...Will sometimes lose concentration and pull his head away from the ball, causing drops, but steadily improved in the area as a senior (caught 84 of 102 possible catchable throws in 2007).\r",

                "Overview": "For more than two decades, tight ends at Missouri and in what is know the Big Twelve have been measured against former Mizzou great and NFL Hall of Famer Kellen B. Winslow. \r\nWith a stellar career in which he started all 50 games and set school records -- including the overall reception record -- and new marks for Big Twelve tight ends, Martin Rucker became the standard-bearer at this position.\r\nNebraska's loss was Missouri's gain, as the little brother of former Huskers and present Carolina Panthers defensive end Mike Rucker, decided that he would enroll at the rival school rather than reside in Lincoln, Nebraska. Very close to his oldest brother, Martin Rucker was often found at the Panthers' training facility or their games when not involved with the Missouri football program. That bond helped soothe the youngster after he withdrew his name from consideration for the 2007 NFL Draft as an underclassman.\r\nThe NFL advisory board had informed Martin Rucker last year that he was regarded as only a fifth-round prospect. With that information, Martin Rucker wisely chose the course of returning to school for his final season. \"I'm glad that I looked into this, it was a good experience to go through, and the feedback I got was really positive,\" said Rucker. \"I'm very excited about the chance to eventually play in the NFL, but I believe that playing one more year at Mizzou will be the best for me. We have some business to take care of next year, and I want to be a part of what I believe can be a special season.\"\r\nMissouri has been blessed with a wealth of talent at the tight end position the last three years. Even though Rucker was the starter, Chase Coffman was often utilized in two-tight end formations, giving the Tigers the best tandem in football at that position. \r\nAndy Hill, the Missouri assistant who was the lead recruiter of both tight ends, contends the common perception of the two stars isn't totally correct. Rucker is looked at, generally, as the more powerful of the two players, Coffman more as a speedy wide receiver-type. But Rucker's 40 time is 4.63 seconds compared with Coffman's 4.8. \"Chase, he's a quicker person in separation than he is fast running,\" said Hill, Missouri's wide receivers coach. \"He catches the ball away from his body, too, so he can catch even if he's covered pretty well. Rucker is more of a smoother, athletic guy. Rucker, the first time I saw him in high school he was running track; a triple-jumper, a sprinter.\"\r\nAt Benton High School, Rucker was a standout tight end and defensive end. He earned first-team All-State honors as a tight end and first-team All-District and All-Conference accolades at both tight end and defensive end. He was ranked 28th among the nation's tight end prospects by Rivals.com, and as the 12th-best prospect of any position in the state of Missouri by the same outlet.\r\nA Super Prep All-Midlands and 51st-rated player, Rucker had 23 catches for 207 yards and two touchdowns while recording 64 tackles and seven quarterback sacks on the defensive side of the ball in his final campaign. As a junior, he caught 25 passes for 340 yards and three scores, adding 54 tackles on the defensive side of the ball. He also had eight catches for 99 yards as a sophomore in 2000.\r\nAn excellent all-around athlete, Rucker added All-District and All-Conference honors in basketball. He also excelled in track, placing 12th in the state in the triple-jump. He won conference and district titles in the triple-jump, as well as a conference championship in the long jump.\r\nChoosing Missouri over Nebraska as his college was an easy decision. It kept him close to his family in Jefferson City, where his father, Martin, is a member of the House of Representatives in the state of Missouri. He spent the 2003 season on the Tigers scout team and was limited in 2004 preseason practices due to a right labrum tear that eventually required surgery in March of his redshirt campaign. \r\nHe would start all 11 games for Missouri in 2004, ranking sixth on the team with 19 receptions for 263 yards (13.8-yard average) and four touchdowns. He also recorded four tackles (two solo) and recovered a fumble on special teams. For that performance, he earned Freshman All-American second-team and Freshman All-Big Twelve Conference first-team recognition.\r\nIn 2005, Rucker was named first-team All-Big Twelve and selected the team's Receiver of the Year. He led the team and all conference tight ends with 47 receptions for 567 yards (12.1-yard average) and a touchdown, the second-best season total ever by a Tigers tight end. He also continued to play on special teams, coming up with four tackles (three solo).\r\nAs a junior, Rucker was named the Metro Kansas City Player of the Year, adding first-team All-Big Twelve Conference honors. He ranked second on the team and finished ninth among the nation's tight ends with 53 catches for 511 yards (9.6-yard average) and scored five times. His total yardage after his first three seasons at Missouri totaled 1,341 yards, becoming only the fourth tight end in school history to gain over 1,000 yards receiving in a career.\r\nA consensus first-team All-American and unanimous All-Big Twelve Conference choice, Rucker was also a finalist for the Mackey Award, given to the nation's top tight end. He set a school record and shattered the conference tight end record with 84 receptions for 834 yards (9.9-yard average) and eight touchdowns. He led the nation's tight ends with an average of six receptions per game and gained 50 yards on 14 carries (3.6 avg). He also recovered two fumbles and made an assisted tackle.\r\nIn 50 games at Missouri, all starts, Rucker set the school record and finished eighth in Big Twelve Conference history with 203 receptions. He ranks second in Missouri annals with 2,175 yards receiving (10.7-yard average) and is 11th on the school's all-time list with 11 touchdown grabs. He gained 56 yards on 16 carries (3.5-yard average), recorded nine tackles (seven solo) and recovered three fumbles."

He has good mobility to throw when flushed out of the pocket and is an efficient game manager. He shows good strength stepping up in the pocket and the lateral agility to side-step the bull rush, but is not a threat to get big real estate with his feet. He lacks accuracy and arm strength when unleashing the long ball, as most of his interceptions were the result of him trying to attack the deep secondary. He is a cool field general with a great work ethic and shows some similarity to Rich Gannon (ex-Raiders, Chiefs) in his ability to be innovative on the field.

In that situation, he threw nine of his 10 interceptions in 2006 and 10 of 14 in '07...It is rare to see him force the ball, showing patience going through progressions and also has the intelligence to get innovative...Has the strength to stand tall in the pocket and will not be forced into rushing his throws (will take a sack rather than fire into traffic)...Not easy to knock down once he gets on the move and is a slippery runner who lacks valid foot speed, but has good side-step agility...Inspires the confidence of the entire team on the field and he is a mature leader who won't point fingers, rather accepting blame for a broken play...Excels throwing in the short area, as he puts good zip and touch on his throws, especially on underneath and crossing routes...Can vary his speed and take something off when working in this area...Very good game manager who has the pinpoint accuracy to put the ball into tight areas and keeps the receivers in their routes, doing a nice job of hitting them out of the breaks...Can vary the speed on his short throws, but can drill it to his targets while on the move without having his man have to adjust...Has a nice feel for pocket pressure, demonstrating the vision to locate the backside action and does a good job of stepping up and out to avoid, but will not hesitate to tuck the ball and run with it, if he locates a good crease...Has the ideal height you look for in a quarterback to scan the field over the defensive linemen and is quick to check down and locate his secondary receivers, keeping defenses honest when rolling out, as he does not need to set his feet to fire the ball on the move...In 2007, he showed improved footwork in his setup, driving back from center much smoother than in the past...Surveys the field and goes through progressions well, but needs to look off his primary target more often...Worked hard to improve throwing the deep pass with better placement...Not really an escape artist, but he shows good awareness to pressure and has enough mobility to elude heat in the pocket...Knows how to vary the speed of his tosses when working underneath.\r"

                "Overview": "When a new coaching staff, headed by Jeff Jagodzinski, took over at Boston College during the spring, there were many questions, but the staff felt that the quarterback picture was in very capable hands with Ryan at the helm. \r\nRecovered from a nagging foot injury that plagued him throughout the 2006 season, the lanky quarterback has compiled a 25-7 record as a starter for the Eagles.\r\nRyan went on to earn Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year honors as a senior and was emerging as one of the Heisman Trophy favorites until the Eagles lost three of their final five regular season games. He would go on to rank eighth in the nation in total offense and established new school records for 400-yard passing performances in both a career and season, en route to throwing for 4,507 yards.\r\nAt William Penn Charter School, Ryan earned All-East honors from Tom Lemming's Prep Football Report. He also captured All-Southeastern Pennsylvania accolades as a senior quarterback, in addition to receiving All-City first-team honors in 2002 and second-team recognition in 2001. He also was a three-time All-League (InterAc) selection.\r\nRyan threw for more than 1,300 yards with 15 touchdowns and just two interceptions as a senior. He finished his career by completing more than 52 percent of his pass attempts during his three seasons at the helm. He served as football team captain in 2002 and also captained the school's basketball and baseball teams.\r\nRyan followed in the footsteps of his uncle, John Loughery, who played quarterback at Boston College from 1979-82. He enrolled at the university in 2003, spending the season performing on the scout team. He earned BC's Freshman Male Scholar-Athlete Award recognition in 2004. He appeared in seven games, starting the regular-season finale vs. Syracuse. He hit on 35-of-71 passes (49.3%) for 350 yards, a pair of touchdowns and three interceptions.\r\nThe MVP of the MPC Computers Bowl vs. Boise State, Ryan started five of 10 games for the Eagles in 2005. He took over starting duties from Quinton Porter midway through the season, going on to throw for 1,514 yards, eight touchdowns and five interceptions on 121-of-195 throws (62.1%). He also rushed 37 times for 94 yards (2.5-yard average) and five scores, becoming the first BC quarterback since 1998 to run for two scores in a game (vs. Ball State).\r\nA broken bone in his left foot limited Ryan's mobility the second half of season, but he still earned All-Atlantic Coast Conference first-team honors in 2006. He led the ACC in total offense (242.25 yards per game), points responsible for (9.63 per game), pass completions (No. 10 in the nation with 21.92 per game) and passing yards per game (15th nationally with an average of 245.17 yards per game). He completed 263-of-427 passes (61.6%) for 2,942 yards, 15 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He also ran for four scores, finishing with 2,907 yards in total offense.\r\nRyan underwent offseason foot surgery and was fully recovered by spring drills. The team offensive captain was named ACC Offensive Player of the Year and earned league Player of the Week honors six times during the 2007 campaign. He shattered single-season BC records, as he completed 388-of-654 passes (59.3%) for 4,507 yards, 31 touchdowns and 19 interceptions. He also scored twice on 68 carries, finishing with 4,509 yards in total offense, an average of 322.1 yards per game.\r\nIn 45 games at Boston College, Ryan started 34 contests. He connected on 837 of 1,347 passes (59.91%) for 9,313 yards, 56 touchdowns and 37 interceptions. He rushed 168 times for 58 yards (0.3-yard avg) and 11 scores, adding a one-yard reception and one solo tackle. He lost seven of his 17 total fumbles and was sacked 50 times for losses totaling 381 yards. On 1,515 offensive plays, he amassed 9,371 yards in total offense, an average of 208.24 yards per game."

                    "Compares To": "LARRY CSONKA-ex-Miami...No, Schmitt is not just a blocking back, even though he will make a nice living doing just that. He proved early in his career that he is capable of getting the tough yardage up the middle of the field and is a runaway truck once he clears the line of scrimmage. He is a decent safety valve coming out of the backfield in the short-area passing game and, much like Csonka and former Bengals' RB Pete Johnson, he is a load to bring down with the ball in his hands. To use him strictly as a blocker is to get great value, but you will then be wasting his other talent. A definite throwback to the Csonka/Jim Taylor (Green Bay) era, Schmitt is the best fullback available for the 2008 draft.",

                "Overview": "Even though he was sometimes a forgotten man in a loaded backfield, few could argue that Schmitt was perhaps the team's most important player throughout his three seasons in the program. His devastating blocks and ability to play both fullback and tight end brought back memories of football's glory years for professional scouts watching him play. Most agree he is a throwback to an era where the fullback knew his role -- deliver devastating blocks.\r\nSchmitt is a powerhouse with a running style that dares defenders to try and stop him. Through 353 career rushing attempts, he has been tackled for a loss just four times. Whether it is getting the tough yardage near the goal line, clearing a rush lane or catching the ball out of the backfield, Schmitt is more than up to any task the coaches ask from him. Evident of that was a new wrinkle that he added to his game as a senior -- handling \"pooch\" punting duties.\r\nAt Fairfax High School, Schmitt earned unanimous All-Conference and Liberty District Most Valuable Player accolades. The tough tailback led the conference in rushing and also served as team captain. He excelled in baseball, picking up All-District and All-Region recognition in that sport.\r\nSchmitt had a rough childhood. He and his mother, Serena Drangle, constantly moved and, during one stretch, the pair was forced to sleep in their car. This caused Schmitt's academics to suffer and he failed to qualify for a spot at the University of Maryland after graduating from high school. He enrolled at Wisconsin-River Falls in 2003, where he became an immediate fan favorite.\r\nThat season, Schmitt earned All-Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference honors, as he ranked third in the league and led the team with 193 carries for 1,063 yards (5.5-yard average) and five touchdowns in nine starting assignments. He also caught two passes for 10 yards, amassing 1,073 all-purpose yards.\r\nSchmitt left UW-River Falls after that season, joining the West Virginia program as a walk-on. Under NCAA transfer rules, he was forced to sit out the 2004 season. In 2005, he started six games at fullback, while also lining up at the tailback and tight end positions. An Iron Mountaineer Award winner for his performances in the weight room, the versatile athlete collected 380 yards on 48 attempts (7.9-yard average) with two touchdowns, as the opposition failed to tackle him for a loss on any play. He also caught eight passes for 76 yards (9.5-yard average) and returned a kickoff 20 yards.\r\nAs a junior, he started four of the 13 contests in which he played, seeing action mostly at fullback, but he also lined up at tight end and tailback. He earned All-American second-team honors from The NFL Draft Report and Scout.com, and was the recipient of the Whitey Gwynne Award, given by the WVU coaches to the team's unsung hero. He added NSCA Strength All-American honors, bulking up to 260 pounds from 245 during the offseason. \r\nSchmitt ran for 351 yards and seven touchdowns on 65 carries (5.4-yard average) and was stopped for a loss on only one carry. He caught 12 passes for 91 yards (7.6 avg) with a score, recorded one solo tackle and returned a kickoff 14 yards. He also collected 87 knockdowns, including 16 touchdown-resulting blocks.\r\nIn 2007, Schmitt was an All-American first-team pick by The NFL Draft Report and selected by the coaching staff for the Ira E. Rodgers Award. He received All-Big East Conference second-team honors from Rivals.com, as he continued to dominate as a blocker, coming up with 106 knockdowns and 17 touchdown-resulting blocks. \r\nSchmitt started 11 of 13 games at fullback, rushing 47 times for 272 yards (5.8-yard average) and four touchdowns while getting tackled just once behind the line of scrimmage. He finished fourth on the team with 12 receptions for 121 yards (10.1-yard average) and a score while also having two of three punts downed inside the 20-yard line, finishing with a 20.3-yard average and one solo tackle.\r\nWith the success of the West Virginia running game, thanks to Schmitt's blocking -- he broke 10 facemasks over the last three years -- the national media turned him into a favorite. Bruce Feldman, a senior writer at ESPN the Magazine stated, \"Truth is, no one better epitomizes the rugged image of this blue-collar program that literally pounded its way to respect.\" Ivan Maisel of ESPN.com chimed in, \"Fullback is an anachronism in the modern offense. Guys like Schmitt may spearhead a comeback.\"\r\nMike Wise of the Washington Post wrote, \"He rumbles like a beer truck with a broken parking brake.\" Craig James of the ESPN Network remarked, \"He's got a forehead made of steel.\" Color commentator Gary Danielson said: \"This guy is a folk hero in West Virginia. He does it with pure power.\"\r\nFormer head coach Rich Rodriguez also said, \"Part of what he did in that (Louisville) game, and what we try to embody in our program, is playing tough and physical all the way from the first play to the last play. That is Owen Schmitt.\"\r\nIn 38 games at West Virginia, Schmitt earned a total of 21 starts, including four at tight end. He carried 160 times for 1,003 yards (6.3-yard average) and 13 touchdowns, as he was tackled for a loss just twice. He caught 32 passes for 288 yards (9.0-yard avg) and two scores, adding 34 yards on two kickoff returns. He punted three times for 61 yards (20.3 avg) with two kicks downed inside the 20-yard line and recorded two solo tackles."

He has the strength to rock the defender back, but must keep his hands inside his framework better and use them with better consistency. He has a good base and knee-bend in pass protection, but is better served working in-line, as his lack of lateral agility was exposed late in his senior year when taking on the speedy edge rushers at offensive tackle.

He started all twelve games at right offensive guard, collecting 47 knockdowns and five touchdown-resulting blocks as the team averaged 379.5 yards per game in total offense.\r\nThe right guard was one of three OSU offensive linemen to receive postseason honors, as he was awarded All-Pac-10 Conference honorable mention. He again manned the right guard spot, helping the Beavers improve their running game from 70.7 yards per game in 2004 to 122.5 yards in 2005. He totaled 69 knockdowns and was credited with seven touchdown-resulting blocks.\r\nSchuening was again chosen All-Pac-10 Conference honorable mention in 2006. He started all 14 games, leading a front wall that paved the way for the Beavers to average 242.4 yards per game passing. He would go on to register 75 knockdowns and also made eight touchdown-resulting blocks.\r\nIn 2007, Schuening started the first nine games at right guard and the final four games at right tackle. Despite playing with a bout of walking pneumonia earlier in the year, he dominated in the trenches. The offense generated a bulk of its 4,831 yards (371.6 yards per game) over the right side of the line. Schuening would proceed to lead Pac-10 blockers with 17 touchdown-resulting blocks, adding 114 knockdowns to pick up All-American and All-Pac-10 Conference first-team accolades."

                "Overview": "Unquestionably the face of the Chanticleers' program, Simpson brought the young program into the national spotlight with a sensational junior campaign. The school record-holder for game, season and career marks in receptions, yardage and touchdowns, he produced 11 multiple-touchdown performances in 41 games.\r\nSimpson holds the Big South Conference career-record with 2,430 yards receiving, including a Big South season-record 1,077 yards in 2006, a year he also set the league mark with 16 touchdown catches.\r\nAt Reidsville High School, Simpson earned Class AA All-State honors and was a runner-up for Class 2-AA Mr. NCHSAA Football honors as a senior. He added All-State accolades during his junior season. He led the team to back-to-back Class AA state titles, setting a championship game-record with 13 catches for 133 yards, while also throwing a 62-yard scoring strike to earn Most Valuable Player honors in his final year. He would go on to play in the Shrine Bowl of the Carolinas and also competed in the East-West game.\r\nIn his final campaign, Simpson hauled in 96 passes for 1,324 yards (13.8-yard average) and 14 touchdowns, despite missing three games with an injury. The school's all-time leading receiver amassed almost 3,000 receiving yards during his last two seasons. He also lettered in basketball and track. He led the hoops squad to its first state title as a senior, scoring 19 points in the championship game to garner MVP honors. He also ran on the school's 4x400-meter relay team that captured the state title (3:21).\r\nAs a true freshman at Coastal Carolina in 2004, Simpson earned Big South Conference Freshman of the Year honors and was named Big South Freshman of the Week three times during the season (vs. Morehead State, Davidson and Charleston), where he posted his first career 100-yard receiving game. He started all 11 games, coming up with 26 receptions for 419 yards (16.1-yard average) and eight touchdowns at split end, adding an assisted tackle and a stop for a loss on limited defensive play.\r\nSimpson was a second-team All-Big South Conference selection as a sophomore, as he started six of 11 games in 2005. He also earned South Carolina All-Star recognition from the Orangeburg Touchdown Club. He led the team with 33 catches for 527 yards (16.9 avg) and nine touchdowns, but lost 29 yards on a pair of reverses. He recorded one solo tackle and scored 54 points for the season.\r\nIn 2006, Simpson became the first player in school history to gain over 1,000 yards in a season. The All-American second-team choice by the Associated Press and Football Gazette added All-Big South Conference first-team accolades to his resume. He led the league and ranked eighth nationally in receiving yards (89.75 yards per game), ranked third in the Big South in receptions (5.08 per game) and set the school and conference record for touchdown catches (16). He scored 96 points while grabbing 61 passes for 1,077 yards (17.7 avg) and ran once for an eight-yard loss.\r\nWith Tyler Thigpen graduated, Simpson had to develop chemistry with the team's young quarterbacks in 2007, as the aerial game struggled to gain momentum. Through the team's first 10 games, he ranked fifth in the Big South in receptions (3.7 rpg) and receiving yards (61.3 ypg). He led the team with 37 receptions for 613 yards (16.6-yard average) and 10 touchdowns. He returned a kickoff 15 yards and also gained 10 yards on a reverse. He recovered a fumble and recorded one solo tackle.\r\nSimpson also lettered twice on the school's track team. He was a member of the 2006 Big South Conference Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship squad, earning All-Big South honors after finishing third in both the high jump and long jump. He also set a new school record in the high jump with a leap of 2.05m (6' 8.75\"). \r\nHe finished third at the NCAA East Regionals in the long jump and qualified for the 2007 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships.. He was also on the school record 4x400-meter relay squad that set the new mark at the Big South Championships.\r\nIn 44 games at Coastal Carolina, Simpson started 38 games. He set school records with 157 receptions for 2,636 yards (yardage is also a Big South Conference mark) and 41 touchdowns, averaging 16.79 yards per catch. He scored 246 points, rushed four times for losses totaling 27 yards (minus-6.8-yard average) and returned a kickoff 15 yards. He recorded three tackles (two solo), including one for a three-yard loss and recovered one fumble."

He is quick to gobble up the cushion and get behind the defender, but he is not the most polished route runner you will find. With his size and ability to shield the ball from defenders, he does a fine job of getting to the ball in a crowd. However, he must show better concentration skills, as he has left quite a few thrown balls on the ground. When out in front of the defense, he can take the ball to the house, evident by his 20 touchdown catches. If he gets a clean bill of health leading up to the draft, he will be able to secure first-day draft status.",

                "Overview": "Entering his final season, Sweed was rated the best receiver in college football and one of the nation's top 25 draft prospects by ESPN. However, a left wrist injury that started to bother him in spring camp carried over into fall drills. The injury would force Sweed to the sidelines for stretches throughout the first six games of his final season. His year would finally come to a close after he underwent surgery in mid-October to repair ligament damage.\r\nBefore his career would come to a close, Sweed etched his name into the Longhorns' record books. The two-time All-Big 12 selection ranks second in school history with 20 touchdown catches. While starting 39 consecutive games, he totaled 1,915 yards receiving, the fifth-best season total in Texas history. He also hauled in 124 passes, good for sixth place on UT's all-time record list.\r\nSweed formed an instant bond with quarterback Colt McCoy, who threw 15 touchdowns to the receiver.\r\n\"I think he gets overlooked a lot because he's a great receiver -- he has such great hands,\" McCoy said. \"When we have running plays, anytime we make a big play, it's because Limas is down there making a block.\" \r\nSweed lettered three times as a wide receiver and free safety at Brenham High School. He was a Class 4A second-team All-State and first-team All-Greater Houston selection on offense and an All-District honoree on both sides of the ball as a senior, playing in the 2003 U.S. Army All-American game. He also earned 4A honorable mention All-State and All-District honors as a junior, and while primarily playing defense he was tabbed the District's Sophomore of the Year in 2000.\r\nNearly half of his 72 catches (31) in his final three seasons went for touchdowns. Sweed also averaged 23.4 yards per reception (72 for 1,684 yards), as he helped lead the team to a 14-2 record and a berth in the Texas 4A Division II Championship game in 2002. He caught 38 passes for 796 yards and 12 touchdowns, adding 44 tackles and five interceptions on defense that year.\r\nSweed had 22 receptions for 656 yards and 13 scores and added a pair of interceptions as the team posted an 11-2 record during his junior season. As a sophomore, he recorded 89 tackles and three interceptions, adding 12 catches for 232 yards and six touchdowns that season. \r\nHe also lettered four times in track, performing mostly in the hurdles. Sweed placed fourth in the 110-meter hurdles (14.10 seconds) at the 2003 Texas 4A track-and-field meet and finished sixth as a junior (14.34). He lettered four times in basketball as a forward, earning All-District honors as a junior after averaging 12 points and eight rebounds per game.\r\nAfter redshirting at Texas in 2003, Sweed took over split end duties for the final seven contests of the 2004 campaign. He went on to catch 23 passes for 263 yards (11.4 avg) and also made a solo tackle in 11 contests.\r\nSweed earned All-Big 12 Conference honorable mention as a sophomore. Starting 13 games for the national championship squad, he came up with 36 receptions for 545 yards (15.1 avg) and five touchdowns while also making a pair of solo tackles.\r\nWith the team opening up its passing attack in 2006, Sweed paced the Longhorns with 46 catches for 801 yards (17.4 avg) and 12 touchdowns, setting a school record with at least one scoring grab in seven consecutive games. The All-Big 12 Conference first-team pick also gained 5 yards on a rushing attempt and scored 72 points.\r\nAfter his junior campaign, reports filtered to the media that Sweed was going to file early for the 2007 NFL Draft. The receiver quickly shot down those rumors. \"I feel like I'm a leader on this team, and I want to be a positive influence on the younger guys,\" said Sweed. \"That's why I think it's important for me to come back, develop as a player and get my degree. My intention is to help this team win as many games as we can.\"\r\nInjuries sidetracked Sweed in 2007, ending his season after six games. In and out of the lineup due to his wrist injury, he managed just 306 yards on 19 catches (16.1 avg), scoring three times. He also carried once for a 1-yard loss.\r\nIn 43 games at Texas, Sweed started his last 39 contests. He was credited with 124 catches for 1,915 yards (15.4 avg) and 20 touchdowns. He scored 120 points while gaining 4 yards on two carries and recording three solo tackles."

                "Overview": "Few players in college football can boast the academic and athletic success that Tamme had at Kentucky. The first tight end in school history to be named first-team All-Southeastern Conference twice, Tamme (Danville, Ky.) completed his bachelor's degree in Integrated Strategic Communications with a 3.82 GPA in just three semesters.\r\nHe continued toward a Master's in Business Administration and carried a GPA of 3.83 in graduate school. An Academic All-American choice of the College Sports Information Directors of America, Tamme was also a three-time ESPN/CoSIDA Academic All-District pick. He was a 2007 Draddy Award finalist, one college football's most sought after and competitive awards, which recognizes an individual as the absolute best in the country for his combined academic success, football performance and exemplary community leadership. \r\nTamme is a volunteer peer instructor for summer orientation classes and visits UK's Children's Hospital and the Veterans Administration Hospital for numerous events. On the football field, he often was the go-to receiver in clutch situations, with crucial receptions in the wins over Louisville, Louisiana State, and Vanderbilt as a senior. He would close out his Wildcats career as the all-time leading pass catcher among UK tight ends and second in SEC history, hauling in 133 passes for 1,417 yards (10.7-yard average) and 11 touchdowns.\r\nTamme was a rangy wide receiver and defensive back at Boyle County High School. He was a first-team All-State by the Associated Press and Louisville Courier-Journal as a senior, when he nabbed 46 passes for 797 yards (17.3-yard average) and 13 touchdowns. A finalist for \"Mr. Football\" in Kentucky, he was chosen for the Lexington Herald-Leader \"Class of the Commonwealth,\" which honors the top 22 state of Kentucky seniors.\r\nA four-year letterman and three-year starter at wide receiver and cornerback, helping the team to four consecutive state championships, two in Class AA and two in Class AAA, as the squad compiled a sterling 58-2 record over those four seasons. He was named Most Valuable Player of the state championship games as both a junior and senior. He added All-Southeast Region honors and was rated one of the top 75 wide receivers in the nation, and the seventh-best overall prospect in Kentucky by Rivals.com/Prep Star magazine. He was also the eighth-ranked prospect in the state according to Super Prep.\r\nTamme had 97 receptions for 1,866 yards (19.2-yard average) and 32 touchdowns for his career. He intercepted 23 passes on defense, including two returns for touchdowns, and returned 25 punts for 395 yards (15.8-yard average) and two touchdowns. An indication of his quickness and good hands, he played shortstop, an unusual position for a person with his height. He batted .475 as a junior and played in the Kentucky East-West All-Star Game for high school juniors. \r\nThe multi-sport star was an all-region performer in basketball and an Academic All-State choice in football and basketball. He was very active in school activities, a member of the student council and Beta Club and also served as editor of the school newspaper. \"Jacob is a great football player with great skills. He is also is a great leader. That's what separates him from the rest,\" Boyle County coach Chuck Smith said.\r\nTamme enrolled at Kentucky as a wide receiver in 2003, choosing the university over scholarship offers from Northwestern, Louisville, West Virginia, and Indiana. He spent his first season playing on the scout team and then saw action in 11 games, including four starts, as a receiver in 2004. He went on to catch 16 passes for 161 yards (10.1-yard average) and a pair of scores. His final starting assignment came at tight end, moving to that position for the Tennessee clash.\r\nIn 2005, Tamme started 10 of 11 contests at tight end. He snared 29 passes for 251 yards (8.7 avg) and a touchdown. He also provided value on special teams, as the backup holder blocked two kicks and also returned a punt 10 yards.

He gained 386 yards with two touchdowns on 32 receptions (12.1 avg), starring in the Music City Bowl, where he came up with a clutch touchdown catch. He also was named to the National Good Works Team by the American Football Coaches Association, the SEC Community Service Team by the SEC Office, was selected Academic All-District IV by the College Sports Information Directors of America and was a member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll for the third straight year.\r\nAwards continued to pile up for Tamme in 2007. He was again named All-SEC first-team, in addition to earning Academic All-American honors from the College Sports Information Directors of America, adding SEC Scholar-Athlete of the Year accolades from the league's coaches. He was the 2007 National Scholar-Athlete Award from the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame winner and a member of the National Good Works Team, chosen by the American Football Coaches Association.\r\nThe four-time SEC Academic Honor Roll selection grabbed a career-high 56 passes for 619 yards (11.1-yard average) and six touchdowns. He was a nominee for the Mackey Award, given to the nation's top tight end and would close out his career as the school's all-time receiving leader among tight ends (fifth overall), catching 133 passes for 1,417 yards (10.7-yard average) and 11 touchdowns while starting 37 of 48 contests.

Smith was the same way, but he made a smooth transition to safety and has been productive there because of his tackling skills. Thomas has experience at free safety and has shown good playing skills inside the box. With his strong hand jolt, he will not have any problems rerouting tight ends and backs in the short-area passing game. He does a nice job of mirroring the receivers, until they eat up his cushion on deep routes. Without possessing that explosive burst to close, along with durability concerns, teams might shy away from him in the early rounds when looking for a cornerback, but his draft stock could be higher if he shows that he might be capable of making the move to free safety at the next level.",

                "Overview": "One of the premier lock-down cornerbacks in college football, Thomas' hard-hitting tackling ability and penchant for making big tackles inside the box could see him shift to free safety at the next level. When healthy, he has more than lived up to the challenge of covering the opposition's main receiving target and has allowed just two touchdown catches over the last two seasons.\r\nInjuries have been the only thing to keep Thomas off the field for the Trojans. Because of his ability to dominate vs. the run, he has also seen some action with the linebacker unit. He shows little regard for his own safety, willingly hurling himself into the pile to make the play. He does this despite undergoing surgery on both shoulders during his career, in addition to surgery on his right knee to repair torn ligaments. The grueling rehabilitation he underwent each time saw him return to perform even better than before he was hurt.\r\nAt Ranch Cucamonga High School, Thomas earned 2002 Super Prep All-America, Super Prep All-Farwest, Prep Star All-West, Tom Lemming All-West, Long Beach Press-Telegram Best in the West first-team, Tacoma News Tribune Western 100, All-CIF Division II first- team and Los Angeles Times All-Inland Empire first-team accolades.\r\nA standout tailback and cornerback, Thomas rushed for 1,250 yards on 134 carries (9.3 avg) with 14 touchdowns and caught 30 passes with five scores as a senior. On defense, he recorded 115 tackles, had seven interceptions and forced four fumbles while averaging 44.5 yards on kickoff returns in 2002. \r\nAs a junior, Thomas collected 78 tackles and five interceptions, as he also had 15 catches for 250 yards (16.7 avg) with six touchdowns. He also was on the school's track team, compiling career-bests of 10.5 seconds in the 100-meters and 21.4 in the 200-meters.\r\nThomas enrolled at Southern California in 2003. He was listed second on the depth chart at free safety, but suffered a right shoulder dislocation in fall camp. He underwent surgery, receiving a medical hardship. In 2004, Thomas appeared in 11 games as a reserve cornerback, shifting to that position from free safety during '04 spring drills. Seeing most of his action in the dime packages and on special teams, he made only nine tackles (7 solos), but also batted away a pair of passes and intercepted two others.\r\nThomas took over strong-side (right) cornerback for the first two games of the 2005 season, but he suffered torn ligaments in his right knee vs. Arkansas, underwent surgery and was lost for the rest of the year. He finished with five solo tackles and a pass break-up.\r\nThomas reclaimed his right cornerback job in 2006, earning All-Pac 10 Conference second-team honors. He ranked seventh on the team with 50 tackles (35 solos), having a strong presence on the blitz, as he totaled three sacks for losses of 32 yards and recovered two fumbles, returning one for a touchdown. He also intercepted two passes and deflected 12 others.\r\nPrior to the start of 2007 spring drills, Thomas underwent surgery to repair a left shoulder dislocation. He returned to start all 13 games, again receiving All-Pac 10 Conference second-team recognition. He ranked ninth on the squad with 45 tackles (31 solos) and had a sack with 4.5 stops for losses. He caused three fumbles, recovered another and batted away seven passes. He also gained 44 yards on four interception returns."

                "Overview": "One of the more unheralded players in college football, Wheatley made professional scouts take notice of his ability as a shutdown cornerback. After sitting out the 2005 season following surgery to repair a broken wrist, Wheatley more than made up for lost time, establishing himself as the premier man-coverage cornerback in an extremely talented conference.\r\nOne of the fastest players in college football, Wheatley's sudden burst and running stride has also brought him success as a kickoff returner. His 937 yards on kickoff returns rank fifth on the school's all-time record list and his 506 yards on those returns in 2007 marked the eighth time in Colorado annals that a player amassed more than 500 yards on kickoff returns in a season, and he still has six games in his final campaign to improve those totals.\r\nOne defense, he ranks tied for sixth in Colorado history with eleven interceptions. He returned two of those pass thefts for touchdowns, one short of the school career-record of three by Victor Scott (1980-83). He has also batted away 27 other passes thrown in his area, giving him 38 passes defended over 37 games.\r\n\"When the pro scouts come by, I just jump on the table for Terrence Wheatley,\" said Colorado head coach Dan Hawkins. \"I think he is a very solid individual, he is a hard worker, he is a smart guy, he is dependable, he is very, very consistent and he is a special talent. I could see that guy, if he continues, being an All-American type player. It is awesome to have him in the return game, too, because we know how fast he is and now that his wrist is healed up and it's not as big a problem as it was last year, he can do some great things there. But he is a great kid, he really is.\"\r\nAt Plano East High School, Wheatley earned All-State honorable mention, Dallas Morning News All-Area first-team honors as a cornerback and receiver and was named to the All-District 9-5A first-team. He was rated the 56th-best cornerback in the nation by Rivals.com and also garnered the Plano Star Collin County Most Valuable Player accolades as a senior. As a junior, he received All-District second-team recognition as a receiver and first-team accolades as a kickoff returner.\r\nDuring his final campaign, Wheatley recorded 82 tackles (three for loss), along with five interceptions, nine pass deflections, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery. On offense, he caught 25 passes for 410 yards and three touchdowns; he averaged 35 yards per kickoff return and 15 yards per punt return. The team finished 8-4 that season, winning the district title, but lost in the second round of the playoffs.  \r\nAs a junior, he totaled 70 tackles (four for loss), with six interceptions, 18 pass breakups, three forced fumbles and three recovered fumbles. He played running back sparingly, rushing 23 times for 200 yards, and added 11 catches for 161 yards and two touchdowns.  He also averaged 25 yards per kickoff return and eight yards on punt returns. That year, he guided the squad to an 8-3 record, winning the district championship before losing in the first round of the playoffs.\r\nWheatley added three letters in track, setting school records in the triple-jump (50-8), long jump (24-61/2) and 100 meters (10.15). He was the Texas Relay champion in the triple jump (48-5) his junior year, and he won district championships in the 100, long jump and triple-jump. He also was the district champion in the triple-jump as a sophomore. \r\nWheatley enrolled at Colorado in 2003, seeing action in 12 games on special teams and in six contests on defense. He started vs. Baylor and Kansas State at right cornerback, coming up with 30 tacklers (22 solo) and five pass deflections. He also gained 57 yards (29.5-yard average) on a pair of kickoff returns. His first start against Baylor was historical, as he joined Sammy Joseph at cornerback, marking the first time in CU history that a pair of freshmen started at the same position in the same game. On special teams, he ranked fifth on the squad with seven points.\r\nHe underwent right wrist surgery during the offseason and, even though he appeared in 13 2004 games, he did not win a starting job until the last five contests, taking over at right cornerback. Wheatley delivered 37 tackles (31 solo) with three pass deflections and four interceptions, returning one for a touchdown. He also gained 357 yards on 16 kickoff returns (22.3-yard average). On kick-coverage units, he was credited with six points.\r\nSeveral additional surgeries on his right wrist forced the NCAA to grant Wheatley a medical hardship for the 2005 season. He returned to action in 2006, earning first-team All-Big Twelve Conference honors from the league's coaches. He started all 12 games at right cornerback, seeing more playing time (776 plays) than any other defender on the team. He produced 58 tackles (43 solo) with 1 1/2 sacks, 4 1/2 stops for losses and four pressures. He caused a fumble, recovered two others and led the team with 11 pass breakups. He also had five interceptions.\r\nIn 2007, Wheatley garnered preseason All-American second-team (Scout.com, The NFL Draft Report) honors. He was on the Jim Thorpe Award (nation's top defensive back) Watch List and also received All-Big Twelve first-team preseason accolades. He shifted to the demanding left cornerback position, making 17 tackles (14 solo) with eight pass deflections and two interceptions. He caused a fumble and gained 506 yards on 19 kickoff returns (26.6-yard average).\r\nThrough 37 games at Colorado, Wheatley started 25 contests. He participated in 1,933 defensive plays, recording 142 tackles (111 solo) with 1 1/2 sacks for minus-5 yards, 6 1/2 stops for losses for 13 yards and five quarterback pressures. He recovered two fumbles and caused three others. He also deflected 27 passes (tied for ninth in Colorado history). He ranks tied for sixth in school history with 11 interceptions for 124 yards in returns (11.3 avg) and his two touchdowns rank second on the Colorado all-time record list. He ranks fifth in school history with 937 yards on 38 kickoff returns (24.66 avg). He also added 18 hits on the special-teams coverage units."

He has some decent value forcing the run, but he fails to use good punch or hand placement vs. tight ends and is marginal in coverage.

That role seemed to affect his performance as a senior, and some believe he's better when he doesn't have to think so much...Must show a better feel for blocking schemes, as he will generally be covered up on inside runs...Has only adequate strength to take on blocks and doesn't use his hands well, causing him to struggle to separate from blockers when playing in a phone booth...Can mirror short-area receivers, but needs to get more aggressive with his hands in attempts to reroute them, as he allows too many easy short throws to be caught...Must improve his hand placement and punch, or he will continue to struggle to shed tight ends...His tight hips contribute to his issues tackling in space and he shows just adequate straight-line speed to flow to the ball, looking stiff when trying to redirect or move laterally when trying to navigate through traffic...A hard hitter who knocks ballcarriers back on contact, but struggles to break down, as he leaves his feet often...Must show better cutting ability from his breaks, as he will take false steps in transition, especially when he is forced out of his pedal too early by a receiver eating up his cushion and getting behind him...Shows adequate ability to turn, open, and get depth in his pass drops, but is too rigid in his movement and has only adequate quickness and hip snap to cover ground in a hurry...Although he can make plays on passes he has a shot at, he lacks natural ball skills or hands...Poor playmaker in zone coverage...Started developing a bad habit of throttling down when not involved in the play and showed marginal desire in his long pursuit during his senior year.\r",

                "Overview": "Considered by scouting experts to be one of the nation's best blitzing linebackers, Philip Wheeler is extremely difficult to knock off his feet.\r\nHe was originally recruited as a defensive end, moving to outside linebacker with the Yellow Jackets before shifting inside as a junior.\r\nDespite his erratic play as a senior, he received glowing praise from former head coach Chan Gailey. \"Philip has really come a long way since having his hand on the ground (as a defensive end) as a high school senior,\" said coach Chan Gailey. \"You didn't know if he could play 'up' or not. But he has developed into a great linebacker. He had his hand on the ground every snap in high school as a defensive end. You could see his talent, but you didn't know if he could develop into the player he has developed into today.\" \r\nWheeler was expected to be a new breed of leader for Georgia Tech's defense under acclaimed defensive coordinator Jon Tenuta. His predecessors, players such as KaMichael Hall and James Butler, tended to be vocal and cerebral, almost extensions of Tenuta on the field. Wheeler neither coaches nor preaches. And on a veteran defense with seven other returning starters, he needed to make plays to lead. \r\nWheeler has been what safety Jamal Lewis calls a \"freakish athlete\" since his first day on campus. But he was undisciplined, a pass rusher easily fooled by play fakes and misdirection. He missed more assignments than he nailed. But by his senior season, Wheeler had the linebacker gig nailed.\r\nAt Shaw High School, Wheeler was a first-team All-State Class AAAA pick by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and honorable mention All-Region selection by Prep Star. He made 106 tackles with 34 stops for losses and five forced fumbles as a senior defensive end. The team captain and four-year letterman helped his team to state title as a sophomore.\r\nIn 2003, Wheeler enrolled at Georgia Tech as a 215-pound rush end, seeing action mostly on special teams. He appeared in 12 games, coming up with six tackles (four solo) and a quarterback pressure. Moved to outside linebacker in 2004 spring camp, the youngster spent the season on the scout team, adjusting to playing outside linebacker.\r\nHe returned to the gridiron in 2005, starting 11 of 12 games at weak-side linebacker. Wheeler finished sixth on the team with 64 tackles (36 solo). He had four sacks and 11 1/2 stops for losses, as he caused and recovered a fumble. He broke up four passes and intercepted four others.\r\nAs a junior, Wheeler shifted to middle linebacker, bulking up to 225 pounds for the 2006 season. He earned second-team All-American honors from Rivals.com and was a second-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference choice by the league's coaches. He ranked second on the squad with 89 tackles (52 solo), as he paced Tech with nine sacks and 14 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He added two pressures with a pair of fumble recoveries and one forced fumble. He also knocked down five passes.\r\nEven with an uneven 2007 campaign, Wheeler garnered All-ACC second-team honors. Now bulked up to 238 pounds, he led the team with 89 tackles (46 solo), including six sacks, nine stops for losses and a pressure. He caused a fumble, recovered two others and deflected five passes.\r\nIn 51 games at Georgia Tech, Wheeler started 38 contests. He registered 248 tackles (138 solo), with 19 sacks for minus-137 yards, 35 stops for losses totaling 172 yards and four quarterback pressures. He caused three fumbles and recovered five others, returning two for a total of eight yards. He deflected 14 passes and intercepted four others for 18 yards in returns."

Both need to improve their overall strength and add bulk to handle the demanding task of playing left tackle. Williams might be a better fit at guard early in his career, so as not to expose him against speedy edge rushers. He can mirror the quicker defender in the short area, but he is marginal taking on second-level defenders and needs to improve taking proper angles when working in space. He has the frame to get bigger, but needs to play with more tenacity. He is a smart student, but will miss a few assignments due to mental lapses. With just adequate hip snap, he would be a liability starting at left tackle as a rookie, but he has the makeup, size and desire to improve.",

Will play off his man too quickly at times rather than locking on to drive out and sustain...Sometimes struggles to cut off on the second level...Must improve his hip snap, as he does not always get to his seal-off point in a hurry...Needs to generate stronger leg drive in attempts to explode into the defender and finish off the block...Lacks hip explosion, making him more reliant on his hand placement than feet when trying to sustain...Will sometimes struggle with quick defenders, but will use his size to take up space and anchor...Can pull, but is sometimes slow moving his feet and needs to do a better job of taking proper angles trying to adjust in the open field...Must roll his hips better on contact, as he is too inconsistent finishing in the second level.\r",

Has better reach, scope and down blocking ability when working in-line...Uses his long arms well to latch on to his man in attempts to control and wall off...Shows decent ability to sink his weight when sitting and holding up vs. the bull rush...Good on the short pulls when running a straight line, working hard to keep his feet on initial contact...Keeps his hands up high and inside his framework, defeating his man with finesse counter moves rather than using strength...His quick placement lets him gain advantage upon initial contact...Not a violent puncher, but knows how to use his reach to control...Has experience at both tackle and guard (until he develops more bulk and strength, he might be a better fit at guard, thanks to his short area burst).\r"

                "Overview": "Called the finest offensive tackle in Vanderbilt history, Williams became the first Commodore to earned All-Southeastern Conference honors (2007) from league coaches since Will Wolford in 1984. Despite manning the demanding left tackle position, he consistently received winning blocking grades over the last two seasons, as he allowed just two quarterback sacks over the course of his last 1,558 snaps.\r\nAt Catholic High School, Williams earned all-conference and all-region recognition as an offensive tackle. He guided one of the most powerful Louisiana teams to a 10-2 record en route to the district title as a senior. He added Class 5A All-State Academic Team honors and served as vice president of the National Honor Society. He was also a member of the Key Club, French Club and Beta Club.\r\nWilliams enrolled at Vanderbilt in 2003, but did not see any playing time until the 2005 campaign. He performed on the scout team in 2003 at both guard and tackle. Because of some academic issues in the school's engineering program, the talented youngster was ruled ineligible for football competition in 2004, again spending a season on the scout team.\r\nIn '05, Williams appeared in 11 games, earning starting assignments in nine games at left offensive guard. He also saw action in six games at left tackle, replacing Ryan King when the tackle was struggling. Williams twice earned team Offensive Player of the Game honors (vs. Mississippi and Middle Tennessee), as he delivered 54 knockdowns and graded over 83% for blocking consistency on 828 offensive snaps.\r\nWilliams emerged as a junior, taking over left tackle duties full-time. He earned second-team All-SEC accolades, along with the Most Valuable Offensive Lineman Award from the Vandy coaching staff. After allowing a quarterback sack vs. Michigan in the season opener, no other opposing defender would get past the left tackle to sack a Vanderbilt quarterback the rest of the campaign. He posted an 84.1% grade for blocking consistency, along with 79 knockdowns and nine touchdown-resulting blocks. He shared team Offensive Player of the Game honors twice and was named team player of the game in the Tennessee clash. In addition, he was the first Vanderbilt offensive lineman to garner SEC Offensive Lineman of the Week honors, as he graded 94% vs. Georgia.\r\nAs a senior, Williams was named All-American third-team by The NFL Draft Report. The consensus first-team All-SEC pick had a banner senior campaign. On 836 offensive plays, the opposition got to the Commodore quarterback just once while he was lined up at left tackle. The offensive co-captain earned SEC Lineman of the Week honors (vs. Mississippi) and Offensive Player of the Game three times (vs. Alabama, Auburn and Tennessee). He registered 102 knockdowns, including 12 touchdown-resulting blocks, finishing his final season with an 85.7% grade for blocking consistency."

He lacks accuracy and touch when aimed at targets in the short area, especially when forced to throw on the move. He can buy time with his feet in the backfield, but is no threat as a runner. He needs to develop a take-charge attitude, as his leadership skills have yet to fully evolve. He has the size and arm strength you look for in a starting quarterback, but there are several areas of his game --leadership, scrambling, short-area accuracy -- that need to be addressed before he can compete at the next level. While he is an impressive athlete, he must control his weight. Many experts list him as the best QB in the 2008 draft, but despite the media attention, there are still mechanical flaws in his release and delivery and a lack of ideal mobility to consider any of these QB prospects worthy of early first-round consideration.

                    "Positives": "Has a tall, athletic frame with long limbs, large hands, smooth calves and muscle tone, but needs to control his weight (shed some bulk during the 2007 offseason and now looks more mobile moving around in the pocket)...Demonstrates the fluid range of motion to put all of his power behind his follow-through when passing...Can buy time scrambling in the pocket and shows the arm strength to make throws on the move, as he has the velocity needed to get the ball deep...Has made very good strides in his timing and shows much better field vision than he did in the past...Sets up quickly, displaying decent throwing mechanics and precision in the intermediate passing game, along with the play-action agility to throw on the move, thanks to good foot balance...Picks up coverages and schemes well, doing a nice job of reading the defense, as he would much rather eat the ball and take a sack that throw it into tight areas...Quick to call audibles and generally makes good pre-snap judgment calls, as the coaches displayed confidence in giving him freedom to change the plays at the line of scrimmage...Good clock manager who has taken to his leadership-by-example role better than when asked to be a vocal one...As a game manager, he can keep the plays alive and buy time for his targets by stepping up in the pocket or scrambling around to make the completion...Quick to get his feet set driving back from center, showing the back-foot press to gain separation and get to his pass-set point...His balance and nimble feet moving in the pocket help him greatly in play-action situations...Has the arm strength to thread the ball through traffic and did a better job of handling progressions...Has the mental makeup to call his own game and did a better job of picking up stunts and blitzes as a junior and senior than he did earlier in his career...Can throw the deep outs with good consistency, as he has the wrist flick and ball-placement skills to loft the ball into the soft areas or go over the top of the defender firing deep...Despite his wind-up motion, the ball comes out cleanly and smoothly due to his wrist action...Can get the ball downfield effortlessly and has the strength to make his throws from the opposite hash...Has developed better touch on his deep throws, as he can feather the pass away from the defender and drop it into his receivers hands, but when he throws off the wrong foot, his passes lack touch...No longer locks on to his primary target and will scan the field to find his secondary receivers, even though that will sometimes result in him getting sacked or being too late to hit those third-option targets in stride...Most of his success throwing deep came vs. Cover-2 defenses, as he can get the ball over the outside shoulder of the receivers operating along the perimeter or when executing on crossing patterns...One of the toughest pocket passers as you will find he knows how to use his size to stand tall in the pocket...Won't flinch standing under pressure and taking the hit or sack rather than coming up with a costly interception.\r"

                "Overview": "Since Andre' Woodson's first start as a sophomore, there were signs of a revival of sorts for the Kentucky football program. \r\nAfter a solid junior campaign, he guided UK to the 2006 Music City Bowl, the team's first postseason appearance since the 1999 season. He again led the Wildcats to the Music City Bowl in 2007, earning game MVP honors. \r\nThe team captain threw for 31 touchdowns in 2006, the fourth-best season total in Kentucky history, and followed that up by setting school and Southeastern Conference records with 40 TD passes in '07. He boats the two longest strings of consecutive passes thrown without an interception in school history, producing one stretch of 153 attempts from 2004-05 and then a new NCAA record with a string of 325 tosses without throwing a pick from 2006-07, shattering the previous national mark of 271 throws by Trent Dilfer of Fresno State in 1993.\r\nWoodson was rated one of the nation's top quarterback prospects in 2002 at North Hardin High School. The four-year letterman and three-year starter threw for more than 1,000 yards in each of his last three seasons, helping lead the school to four straight Class AAAA playoff appearances. He was named to the \"Class of the Commonwealth\" -- a collection of the top 22 seniors in Kentucky as named by the Lexington Herald-Leader -- and named honorable mention All-State as a senior. He was also a two-time All-District and All-Area choice.\r\nA relative unknown as a prospect through his junior season, Woodson was on the national radar after eye-opening performances at a Nike camp and the \"Elite 11\" quarterback camp in California before his senior season. He would go on to rank second among state prospects in Kentucky and was rated the seventh-best quarterback in the nation, adding All-American honors from Rivals.com and Prep Star. In his top game as a senior, he threw for 300 yards and six touchdowns vs. Bullitt Central High.\r\nWoodson also lettered four times in basketball. He was a first-team All-State selection by the Louisville Courier-Journal as a senior, averaging 15.5 points and eight rebounds while leading the team in assists with 90. He also garnered third-team All-State recognition as a junior, along with All-Region and All-District honors while leading the team to the state tournament each of his last three seasons. He was named to the All-State tournament team as a junior and senior. He also lettered twice in track, participating in the high jump and the 4x100-, 4x200-, and 4x400-meter relays.\r\nWoodson enrolled at Kentucky in 2003, turning down scholarship offers from Tennessee and Penn State. He redshirted, and then saw action in seven games in 2004, earning his first career start vs. Auburn. He would go on to hit on 54-of-88 passes (61.4%) with two touchdowns and one interception. He was sacked 14 times for minus-80 yards and had seven fumbles, losing five.\r\nAs a sophomore, Woodson started all 11 games. He amassed 1,644 yards passing with six touchdowns and six interceptions on 146-of-253 attempts (57.7%). He also caught a five-yard pass and rushed 57 times for minus-133 yards and a score. However, he also turned the ball over five times on seven fumbles and was sacked 30 times for losses totaling 198 yards.\r\nWoodson earned team Most Valuable Player and All-Southeastern Conference second-team honors in 2006. He ranked 13th in the nation in pass efficiency (154.55 rating) and 12th in total offense, averaging 259.85 yards per game. He led the conference with 3,515 yards (fourth-best season total in school history) and 31 touchdowns while completing 63.0% of his attempts (264-of-419) in 13 games. \r\nHis 31 scoring strikes rank fourth on the school's single-season list, topped only by Tim Couch's 37 touchdowns in 1997 and 36 in '98, and Woodson's SEC-record 40 scores in 2007. He turned the ball over once on three fumbles and was intercepted only seven times. He registered a solo tackle, but was sacked 26 times for losses of 264 yards.\r\nWoodson led the team to an 8-5 record that included a victory over rival Louisville during the 2007 season. The All-SEC second-team pick and team MVP ranked second in the league in total offense (270.46 yards per game) and passing efficiency (144.51 rating), as he completed 327-of-518 passes (63.1%) for 3,709 yards, 40 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He scored three times on 69 carries, but turned the ball over four times on six fumbles.\r\nIn 44 games at Kentucky, Woodson started 38 times. He completed 791-of-1,278 pass attempts (61.89%) for 9,360 yards, 79 touchdowns and 25 interceptions. He carried the ball 232 times for losses totaling 490 yards and scored five times.

                "Overview": "Erik Ainge showed tremendous promise during his freshman season with the Volunteers, but injuries caused him to miss eight games, as he never completed a full schedule in any of his first three years with the team. \r\nThe rangy quarterback battled through injury issues and presently ranked third in school history in pass completions (516), pass attempts (854) and touchdown passes (51). He is fourth in school annals with 6,308 passing yards and 6,107 yards in total offense.\r\nAinge made a long trip from the state of Oregon to the Tennessee campus in 2004. Prior to his arrival, he earned 2003 Oregon Gatorade Player of the Year honors and was named to the Prep Star All-American squad that year for Glencoe High School. The Northwest Nugget (awarded to top six athletes in Northwest U.S.) and All-State selection as a senior, Erik was also a first-team All-Metro quarterback as both a junior and senior.\r\nHe led the state in passing yards, completions and touchdowns during his final season, as he threw for 3,078 yards, 24 touchdowns and only eight interceptions. His best game that year was against Aloha High, finishing 20-of-28 for 475 yards with five touchdowns and he accounted for 62 points in the first three quarters.\r\nAs a junior, Ainge passed for 2,554 yards and 15 touchdowns. He garnered Street & Smith's magazine All-American preseason honorable mention as a guard on the school's basketball team, adding second-team All-Metro honors, as he averaged 16.4 point per game as a junior. He also lettered in baseball, competing as a pitcher, shortstop and first baseman during his freshman and sophomore campaigns. \r\nDuring his first season at Tennessee, Ainge started six of nine games, missing the final four games due to a right shoulder separation. The second-team Freshman All-American choice by The Sporting News added All-Southeastern Conference All-Fresh-man Team and SEC Offensive Freshman of the Year recognition. He added Academic All-SEC accolades, as he completed 109-of-198 passes (55.1%) for 1,452 yards, 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He was held to 29 yards in losses on 16 rushing attempts, finishing with 1,423 yards in total offense (158.1 yards per game).\r\nAs a sophomore, Ainge appeared in eight games, starting vs. Louisiana State, Notre Dame and Memphis. He sat out three games, finishing with a career-low 737 yards on 66-of-145 tosses (45.5%) with five touchdowns and seven interceptions. He turned the ball over three times on five fumbles, was sacked nine times for minus-78 yards and collected 673 yards of total offense on 169 plays (84.1 yards per game).\r\nAinge almost completed the 2006 season unscathed, but a right ankle sprain vs. South Carolina forced him out of action vs. Arkansas. In 12 games, he hit on 233-of-348 passes (66.3%) for 2,989 yards (third-best season total in school history), 19 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He fumbled the ball twice, was sacked 13 times for losses totaling 106 yards. He recorded two solo tackles and gained 2,887 yards in total offense on 374 plays (240.6 yards per game).

He would go on to have his best season at Tennessee, as he connected on 325-of-519 passes (62.6%) for 3,522 yards, 31 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. Never known for his mobility, he lost 32 yards on 16 carries, finishing with 3,490 yards in total offense on 535 plays, an average of 249.29 yards per game.\r\nIn 43 games at Tennessee, Ainge started 35 contests.

His anticipation and timing continued to improve with increased reps as a senior...Throws a tight spiral and while he might not have a \"big arm,\" he can drill the ball in a seam (better on intermediate throws)...Will force the ball on occasion, but generally throws it away when his targets are covered...When he feels backside pressure, he has the feet and balance to step in and out of the pocket...Does not lock on to his target, doing a decent job of going through his progressions...Has the vision to scan the field and is efficient connecting with his receivers on roll-outs and from the outside hashes.\r"

                "Overview": "Matt Flynn was a top quarterback prospect coming out of the state of Texas and hoped to be the featured quarterback at LSU. He was listed third on the depth chart behind Marcus Randall and JaMarcus Russell during his freshman season with the Tigers. \r\nFlynn again lost the battle for the starting job -- to Russell -- the following season, spending the 2005-06 campaigns as the caddy for the first choice in the 2007 NFL Draft. With Russell bolting a year early for the professional ranks, the senior passer was primed to take over full-time signal-calling duties in 2007. \r\nA right ankle injury vs. Virginia Tech would sideline Flynn for the Middle Tennessee State clash in '07. Even before the injury, he saw some of his playing time deferred to Ryan Perrilloux. Even when Flynn returned to the lineup the following game, the coaching staff was so pleased with the performance of Perrilloux, they decided to alternate the two behind center, based on situations. A problem with that decision arose, as Flynn struggled to maintain his rhythm while shuttling in and out of the lineup.\r\nAt Robert E. Lee High School, Flynn was one of the top-rated quarterbacks in the state of Texas and ranked the No. 20 quarterback in the country by Tom Lemming's Prep Football Report and ESPN.com. He was a member of the Super Prep Texas 124 team, adding Dallas Morning News Texas Top 100 and the Tyler Morning Telegraph All-East Texas Football Team honors.\r\nAs a senior, he completed 124-of-206 passes for 1,679 yards and nine touchdowns with 305 yards rushing and 12 scores. He showed his dedication and toughness by leading the Red Raiders to a semifinal appearance in one of the toughest classifications in Texas despite playing his last four games with a broken foot.\r\nAs a junior, Flynn connected on 101-of-199 passes for 1,650 yards, 13 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He guided his team to a Class 5A playoff appearance, but lost to eventual state champion Mesquite.\r\nFlynn enrolled at Louisiana State in 2003, spending the season performing on the scout team. Listed third on the depth chart at quarterback in '03, he spent most of that season as the holder for field goals and placements. He managed some playing time on offense (appeared at quarterback in four of 12 contests), hitting on 4-of-10 attempts for 99 yards and a touchdown.\r\nAs a sophomore, Flynn participated in 13 games, lining up at quarterback in seven of those games. He threw for 457 yards, seven touchdowns and an interception on 27-of-48 tries (56.2%). He earned his first career start vs. Miami in the Peach Bowl, earning Game MVP honors. In the North Texas clash, he became the first non-starter in school history to throw three touchdowns in a quarter.\r\nIn 2006, Flynn again served as the team's holder in all 13 games and appeared under center in 10 contests. He completed 12-of-20 passes (60.0%) for 133 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. He also rushed 13 times for 86 yards (6.6-yard average) and a score.\r\nAs a senior, Flynn started five of the team's first six games. An ankle injury in the second game vs. Virginia Tech would limit his mobility the rest of the season. He was successful on 202-of-359 throws (56.3%) for 2,407 yards, 21 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He added four scores with 215 yards on 100 rushing attempts (2.2-yard average) and amassed 2,622 yards in total offense.\r\nFlynn has appeared in a total of 50 games at Louisiana State, including 33 as a quarterback, starting 12 games at that position. He completed 245-of-437 passes (56.1%) for 3,096 yards, 30 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. He carried 128 times for 340 yards (2.7-yard average) and five scores. On 565 plays, he amassed 3,436 yards in total offense. He fumbled three times and was sacked 35 times for losses totaling 258 yards."

He is a rare-sized athlete with great mobility in the pocket, but his delivery is a mess and his footwork leaves a lot to be desired. He forces a lot of throws and needs generate better touch on his short-area throws and improve the zip on his deep passes.

                "Overview": "Kevin O'Connell literally put himself on the map as a senior. Of all quarterbacks invited to the NFL Combine, he was the only one not listed as a potential pro prospect in preseason evaluations. \r\nAfter working under the tutelage of former NFL quarterback and present Aztecs head coach, Chuck Long, teams now view O'Connell as one of the finer athletes at his position eligible for the 2008 draft.\r\nO'Connell is a rarity in college sports, having served as team captain in each of his four seasons with the Aztecs. He is the first player in school history to lead the team in both passing and rushing in the same season (2007). He holds the school career record for yards rushing (1,312) and touchdowns rushing (19) by a quarterback.\r\nA dual threat, O'Connell also showed off his strong arm for the Aztecs. He finished his career second in school history by completing 664-of-1,151 passes (57.69%) and gaining 9,001 yards in total offense. His 7,689 yards passing placed him third on the SDSU all-time record chart, while his 46 touchdown tosses rank fourth in Aztec annals. \r\nO'Connell was a standout in both football and basketball at La Costa Canyon High School. After missing a good portion of his junior year with injury, O'Connell was named All-Region by Super Prep and honorable mention All-Region by Prep Star. He added All-League, All-North County and All-San Diego accolades.\r\nIn his final season, O'Connell passed for 1,950 yards and 19 touchdowns for the 7-4 Mavericks. He also ran for 310 yards. During his injury-shortened junior campaign, he threw for 980 yards and seven scores on 56 completions. During his prep career, he earned three letters in football and two more in basketball.\r\nO'Connell turned down a scholarship offer from Colorado, spending his 2003 season redshirting at San Diego State. He was named team captain midway through the 2004 season, taking over at quarterback for the final five games while competing in nine contests. He ranked third on the team with 347 yards and a score on 73 carries (4.8-yard average). He connected on 115-of-236 tosses (48.7%) for 1,328 yards, nine touchdowns and nine interceptions, amassing 1,675 yards in total offense.\r\nAs a sophomore, O'Connell started all 12 games.

He also proved to be a fearless runner, ranking second on the team with 402 yards (school season-record for a quarterback) and five touchdowns on 140 carries (2.9-yard average). However, in addition to his 12 interceptions, he turned the ball over five times on 12 fumbles.\r\nO'Connell's 2006 season was cut short by a right thumb ligament injury that required surgery. He was hurt in the season opener Texas-El Paso, missing the team's next six contests. He appeared in seven games, starting four. He hit on 59-of-101 attempts (58.4%) for 635 yards, including five interceptions and three touchdowns. He turned the ball over twice on three fumbles and rushed 48 times for 155 yards (3.2-yard average) with two scores.\r\nIn 2007, O'Connell earned All-Mountain West Conference second-team honors, becoming the first Aztec quarterback to be named first or second team all-conference since Dan McGwire was a first team pick in 1990, when SDSU played in the Western Athletic Conference. He also became the first player to lead the Aztecs in both rushing and passing in the same season, as he ranked first in the MWC and 23rd nationally in total offense per game (289.2 yards per game) and was second in the league in passing average (255.2 ypg). \r\nOverall, O'Connell completed 257-of-439 passes (58.5%) for 3,063 yards, 15 touchdowns and eight interceptions. He paced the Aztecs with 135 carries for a school record (for quarterbacks, breaking his own 2005 mark with 408 yards (3.0-yard average), setting another SDSU quarterback record with 11 touchdowns on the ground.

He has become the new girl on the dance floor in recent months, thanks to a decent showing in postseason all-star games. But be warned: Don't look at him as a product ready to step into the action at the next level. He came from a bad high school system, was held in mild regard at Pittsburgh and is basically a self-taught prospect, making him a work in progress who'll need time to learn the intricacies of the position. He probably has the best arm of any quarterback in this draft. But he also lacks experience, is unproven against top-level competition, played mostly in the shotgun and has barely adequate mobility.

He scored five times and gained 54 yards on 83 carries (0.7-yard average), but was sacked 23 times and turned the ball over four times on eight fumbles.

As a tackle, he would have big problems even getting into a training camp, mostly due to marginal strength and a lack of aggression in his pass set. He needs to start taking on a mauler's mentality, but he at least showed better aggression as a trap blocking guard than he did as a finesse-type tackle. Late in the draft, a team can find a very capable player who just needs someone to teach him the proper way to play the game.",

The change was rather significant. No longer having to deal with speedy edge rushers, he used his drive blocking skills to greatly improve his blocking consistency (graded 75 percent as a tackle, but had an 85 percent grade as a guard in 2006).\r\nHis banner senior campaign was sidetracked by a torn meniscus in his left knee during the sixth game of the 2007 season, but he made such an impression on opposing coaches that the AFCA awarded him with All-American honors.

He added four letters in track and one in basketball, receiving the Unsung Hero Award for track and was that unit's team captain. He was the Greater Boston League champion in the discus and served as senior class vice president.\r\nBernadeau decided to stay close to home so his disabled mother and family could see him play without having to travel long distances. He took over left tackle duties as soon as he arrived on Bentley's campus as a freshman. He posted 58 knockdowns and six touchdown-resulting blocks, as the offense averaged 458.2 yards per game.\r\nAs a sophomore, Bernadeau earned first-team All-Northeast 10 Conference and All-Northeast Region honors. He again started all season at left tackle, collecting 61 knock-downs to help pave the way for the Falcons to average 440.7 yards per game.\r\nBernadeau was a New England Division II/III All-Star. He was also named All-Northeast 10 Conference first-team and Offensive Lineman of the Year. He started five games at left tackle and six at left guard, as the team managed just 262.5 yards per game.\r\nAs a senior, the AFCA awarded Bernadeau All-American honors. He also earned Northeast 10 Conference Offensive Lineman of the Year honors again.

In 2007, Lynch became the Mountaineers' first three-time All-American first-team selection since two-time Buchanan Award winner Dexter Coakley (1994-96) and also became the school's first four-time All-Conference performer since Chip Hooks (1991-94).\r\nA National Honor Society recipient at Evangelical Christian High School, Lynch was a standout defensive back and running back. He was twice selected to the All-State Class A and All-Lee County squads and was a three-time All-Area choice by the Fort Meyers News-Press. He was twice named District XVI Player of the Year, adding Lee County Defensive Player of the Year honors as a senior.\r\nLynch rushed for 3,000 yards and registered 31 interceptions over his career. He collected 1,101 yards with 11 touchdowns on 120 carries (9.2-yard average), as he also caught 18 passes for 490 yards and seven scores as a senior. On defense, he registered 93 tackles and 11 interceptions during his final campaign.\r\nLynch enrolled at Appalachian State in 2003, appearing in 11 games while starting the final 10 at free safety. He was the only freshman named All-Southern Conference that season, when he led the team with six interceptions and four fumble recoveries. He ranked sixth on the team with 57 tackles (30 solo), including one for a loss and forced a pair of fumbles. He deflected four passes and gained 14 yards on a kickoff return.\r\nLynch was limited to just two games as a sophomore. He suffered a fractured left elbow late in the Eastern Kentucky game returning a punt, and underwent surgery two weeks later. He made 13 tackles (nine solo) with a forced fumble, a fumble recovery and an interception in 2004.\r\nLynch had a banner 2005 campaign. He ranked third in the league and led the team with six interceptions, including two picks in the Eastern Kentucky game. He garnered first-team All-American honors from I-AA.org and second-team accolades from the Associated Press and The Sports Network.\r\nThat season, he was also named to the All-Southern Conference first-team and posted 92 tackles (39 solo) while starting all 15 games. He caused a fumble, had 1 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage and batted away seven passes.\r\nIn 2006, Lynch was named first-team All-American by College Sporting News and second-team by The Sports Network. The first-team All-Southern Conference choice sat out two late-season games with a right arm (ulna) fracture, but still finished third on the team with 85 tackles (43 solo), including five tackles for losses. He ranked tied for ninth in the nation with a team-high five interceptions and also led the Mountaineers with six pass breakups and three blocked kicks. He also recovered a pair of fumbles, returning one 25 yards for a touchdown.\r\nA 2007 All-American first-team choice and National Defensive Player of the Year finalist by The NFL Draft Report, Lynch added national honors from the Associated Press, Walter Camp and the Sports Network. He was a finalist for the Buck Buchanan Award, given to the best defensive player in the NCAA Championship Subdivision ranks, as that honor went to Montana defensive end Kroy Bierman. Biermann received 35 first-place votes and 305 points to edge Lynch by five points in the closest Buchanan Award voting in history. Lynch also received 35 first-place votes out of the 105 ballots cast by a panel of sports information directors and selected media.\r\nThe Mountaineers' safety gained national attention by blocking a kick that sealed ASU's upset win over Michigan in the season opener, going on to record 111 tackles (71 solo) in 15 games. He made three stops behind the line of scrimmage, caused two fumbles and recovered another. He again led the team and Southern Conference with six interceptions and also batted away eleven throws. He blocked three kicks, returning a blocked punt 33 yards.\r\nIn 56 games at Appalachian State, Lynch started his last 55. He ranks sixth in school history with 358 tackles (192 solo), adding 10 1/2 tackles behind the line of scrimmage for 24 yards in total losses. He is tied for 10th in ASU history with six forced fumbles and tied for third with eight fumble recoveries, scoring twice while gaining a total of 31 yards on three returns. \r\nLynch deflected 28 passes and ranks second at ASU with a Southern Conference all-time record 24 interceptions. His 395 yards on interception returns set a school record. His 52 total passes defended established an NCAA Football Championship Subdivision all-time record. He gained 40 yards on two punt returns, 14 yards on a kickoff return and ranks second in ASU annals with six blocked kicks."

Police say his BAC levels were 0.11 and 0.12; officers performed two separate tests for accuracy.\r\nAfter five weeks away from the team, Shirley was reinstated November 15. Two days later, he was dismissed from the school after he was cited for suspicion of driving with a suspended license and expired registration, but was allowed to retain his athletic scholarship.\r\nShirley was a second-team All-League selection, adding San Bernardino Sun All-County honors as a senior at Kaiser High School.

Prior to attending Kaiser High, he spent his first three seasons at A.B. Miller High School.\r\nIn 2003, Shirley enrolled at Fresno State, turning down scholarship offers from Oregon and Arizona. He spent the season competing on the Bulldogs scout team, adding more than 20 pounds of bulk to his frame. In 2004, he appeared in 11 games at nose guard, playing behind Donyell Booker. He totaled 16 tackles (six solo) with a sack, 2.5 stops for losses and a pass deflection.\r\nA high ankle sprain limited Shirley to nine games and forced him to sit out four contests while starting the team's first five clashes at nose guard. He posted 14 tackles (five solo), assisted on a sack and delivered four stops behind the line of scrimmage.\r\nTwenty more pounds of bulk on his 330-pound frame did not seem to slow down Shirley in 2006. He started seven of twelve games, registering 20 tackles (seven solo), two sacks and 4.5 stops for losses. He recovered a fumble and blocked three kicks, including two field goals vs. Hawaii.

                "Injury Report": "No injury report available, but Corner did not miss a game due to injuries at Akron.",
                "Overview": "Corner has been a nightmare for opposing quarterbacks since moving into the starting lineup as a red-shirt freshman. Certainly not the biggest defensive back you will find, he compensates for a lack of height and bulk with outstanding leaping ability, great timing and natural hands to get to more than a fair share of balls in flight. He is the only player to lead outright or share the team lead for interception in each of the four seasons he suited up for the Zips.\r\nHis 15 interceptions tied for second on the school career record list. He joined All-American Dwight Smith (261 yards, 1997-2000) and Shawn Vincent (265 yards, 1988-90) as the only players in Akron annals to return interceptions for 225 or more yards in a career. He had at least one interception or pass deflection in 28 of the 48 games he played in for Akron.\r\nAt McKinley High School, Corner excelled as a wide receiver. He earned All-Ohio, All-District and All-County honors in each of his last two seasons. As a freshman, he was a member of McKinley's 1998 state championship team. As a senior, he played both sides of the ball, coming up with three interceptions and 43 catches for 739 yards and 12 scores. He added 45 catches for 749 yards and eight touchdowns as a junior. He also ran track, where he was a member of the state champion 4x400-meter relay team.\r\nCorner enrolled at Akron in 2003, but sat out the year under NCAA Proposition 48 rules. He took over field cornerback duties in 2004, going on to start 46-of-48 games during his career. That year, he ranked seventh on the team with 55 tackles (41 solos), making three of those stops behind the line of scrimmage. He broke up six passes and intercepted two others.\r\nIn 2005, Corner again finished seventh on the team with 46 tackles (29 solos). He had two stops for losses, along with nine pass deflections and two pass thefts. As a junior, he started 10 games at field cornerback, coming off the bench vs. North Carolina State and Central Michigan. He totaled 44 tackles (30 solos) with a fumble recovery. He picked off four passes and was credited with eight pass break-ups.\r\nCorner garnered All-Mid American first-team honors as a senior. He ranked fourth in the nation and shared the league lead with seven interceptions. He and fellow cornerback Davanzo Tate tied for sixth in the NCAA with 19 passes defended, as Corner broke up 12 tosses. He finished seventh on the team in tackles for the third time in his career, collecting 52 hits (40 solos) with three stops behind the line of scrimmage.\r\nCorner started 46 of 48 games at Akron. He recorded 197 tackles (140 solos) with eight stops for losses of 24 yards and a fumble recovery. He deflected 35 passes and ranks tied for second in school history with 15 interceptions, ranking third all-time with 225 yards in returns (15.0 avg), including one touchdown."

He is not explosive enough to be a pass rusher from the weak side and lacks the bulk and brute strength to generate punishing tackles on the strong side. He comes from a family deep in football tradition, but based on not being invited to any bowl games or the NFL Combine, scouts clearly view him as the \"runt of the litter\" who needs to bulk up and have a great training camp in order to secure a roster spot. If he does that, Ruud is capable of contributing.",

Catches the ball cleanly and runs with a good stride on interception returns...More of a blitzer than a pass rusher, but does have a nice spin move to slip off blocks.\r"

                "Overview": "The three-year starter is part of a \"royal family\" of sorts and his lineage is well-known in and around Lincoln. Bo Ruud is the sixth member of the Ruud clan to play football for the Huskers. \r\nAlong with his brother and father, the Ruud's hold the rare distinction of all ranking among the top 30 career tacklers in school history. Bo Ruud finished with 216 tackles, 22nd on the NU career list. Barrett Ruud is the all-time record holder with 432 stops (2001-04). Their father, Tom, is 26th all-time with 202 tackles (1972-74).\r\nBo Ruud started in each of his last three seasons at Nebraska, taking over at strong-side linebacker as a senior after playing on the weak side his first three seasons. His brother, Barrett, was an All-American and three-time All-Big Twelve Conference middle linebacker and is a starter for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\r\nTom Ruud was an All-Big Eight linebacker for the Huskers and earned academic all-conference honors twice. He was a first-round draft pick in 1975 by Buffalo and played three years for the Bills (1975-77) and two years for the Cincinnati Bengals (1978-79).\r\nTwo of Bo Ruud's uncles -- Bob Martin, 1973-74-75; and John Ruud, 1978-79) -- and his great-grandfather Clarence Swanson (1918-19-20-21) all competed on the Husker gridiron. \r\nBo Rudd was a standout at Lincoln Southeast High School, and was Nebraska's earliest ever commitment, pledging his intention in June of 2001, 20 months before 2003 signing day. He helped the Knights to two Class A state titles. He was a two-way star, playing running back and linebacker. He rushed for 1,385 yards and 15 touchdowns and caught four passes for 125 yards and a pair of touchdowns. \r\nRuud scored four touchdowns in a state semifinal win over Kearney and scored the Knights' only touchdown in a 7-6 title game victory over Millard North. He had 70 total tackles, including 51 solo stops, as a senior. He was named the honorary captain of the Lincoln Journal Star's Super-State team and was a first-team pick as a running back. The Omaha World-Herald named him to its All-Nebraska team as a linebacker and made him the honorary captain on the defense. \r\nRuud made 49 tackles as a junior, and rushed for nearly 450 yards and scored six touchdowns. He also starred on Southeast's basketball team, which finished as the 2003 Class A state runnerup. He was a two-time honorable-mention All-State pick and also earned Academic All-State honors. In addition, he was a National Honor Society member.\r\nRuud redshirted at Nebraska in 2003, but was a part of the travel squad. He played in 11 games as a reserve weak-side linebacker in 2004, posting 17 tackles (12 solo) with a pair of pressures. \r\nAs a sophomore, he started 10 of 11 games at weak-side linebacker, taking over that spot after Steve Octavien was injured in the season opener. Ruud missed the Alamo Bowl when he suffered a broken arm in practice, finishing the year with 80 tackles (41 solo), 2.5 sacks and 14 stops for losses. Ruud added 10 pressures, six pass breakups, two fumble recoveries and a forced fumble, earning All-Big Twelve Conference honorable mention.\r\nRuud was chosen All-Big Twelve first-team as a junior in 2006, starting 13 games. The weak-side linebacker delivered 65 tackles (36 solo), two sacks, seven stops for losses and four pressures. He picked off two passes, deflected four others and caused three fumbles, recovering two of them. \r\nThe team's Guy Chamberlain Award winner received All-Big Twelve honorable mention as a senior. He missed two games after suffering a knee sprain on the first play of the Texas A&M clash, but still finished with 54 tackles (28 solo). Both of his interceptions were returned for touchdowns, as he also knocked down three other throws and caused a pair of fumbles.\r\nIn 46 games at Nebraska, Ruud started 33 contests.

He sort of reminds me of a terrier, with his emotional level, as he is quickly agitated and does not take well to hard coaching. His lack of strength is the result of his disdain for the weight room. When he first gets into the league, Williams will need to grow up in a hurry and just being quick doesn't earn you an NFL paycheck. With a patient mentor, somebody might make a football player out of him, but Williams also needs to become familiar with the weight room. He might be able to get by as a returner while developing as a cornerback.

                "Overview": "Cary Washburn emerged as one of the elite cornerbacks in the small college ranks as a senior for the Ichabods. \r\nThe only NCAA Division II player to be ranked in the top 10 in the nation in interceptions and kickoff-return average in 2007, Williams holds the distinction of being the only player in school history to score on an interception, kickoff return and a reception in the same season.\r\nWilliams, a consensus All-American in 2007, left his mark in the Washburn record books in just two seasons at the university. His seven interceptions as a senior rank second on the school's single-season list. His two kickoff returns for touchdowns last season tied the Washburn season and career records. \r\nHis 100-yard kickoff return vs. Missouri Southern in 2007 tied the school record for longest runback. He also became just the third player to wear an Ichabod uniform to receive American Football Coaches Association All-American first-team honors, joining defensive tackle Trey Lewis (2006) and receiver Troy Slusser (1988).\r\nAt Chaminade-Madonna College Prep, Williams lettered three times as a receiver and defensive back. With the opposition steering clear of his territory, he managed just one interception as a senior. With less than impressive statistics, he was not recruited by major college programs.\r\nWilliams made one recruiting trip to Auburn and talked to smaller Division I-A programs in Florida, including Florida International. He chose Fordham in New York City because the Rams recruited him from the start. \"It might have been the best decision of my life or the worst decision,\" Williams said.\r\nAs a true freshman at Fordham, Williams saw minimal action in six games, recording just three solo tackles in 2003. He appeared in seven games for the Rams in 2004, earning his only start at left cornerback vs. Georgetown. He finished with 15 tackles (12 solo), two pass deflections and a fumble recovery. He also returned nine kickoffs for 177 yards (19.7-yard average). \r\nWilliams left Fordham after a dispute with his position coach during practice. One of the Fordham assistant coaches, Keita Malloy, had spent 2001 on the Washburn staff, and he steered Williams to the Ichabods. Williams took a redshirt year in 2005 to clear his head, adjust to Topeka and learn the Ichabods' system.\r\n\"He came out here sight unseen,\" Washburn head coach Craig Schurig said. \"He's matured a lot. He's got the talent to play in the NFL. He's got great ball skills. He can be a receiver. But corners are harder to find. He has great length. Our quarterbacks make a certain throw, and you think the pass is going to be over his head ... and he reaches up and either snatches it out of the air or tips it.\"\r\nIn his first season at Washburn, Williams teamed with Fletcher Terrell to give the Ichabods one of the best cornerback tandems in the small college ranks. He started all 11 games at right cornerback, posting 38 tackles (30 solo) with a stop for a two-yard loss and also deflected five passes. He had four interceptions and averaged 20.2 yards on 10 kickoff returns.\r\nAs a senior, the All-American selection ranked 10th in the nation with 17 kickoff returns for 487 yards (28.6-yard average) and two touchdowns. The right cornerback ranked sixth in the Division II ranks with seven interceptions and fourth with 164 yards gained on those pass thefts, including one that he returned for a score. He finished sixth on the team with a career-high 56 tackles (37 solo), as he also recovered a fumble.\r\nIn 23 games at Washburn, Williams registered 94 tackles (67 solo) with a stop for a two-yard loss, a fumble recovery and 12 pass deflections. He gained 174 yards with a touchdown on seven interceptions (23.4-yard average). He returned 27 kickoffs for 689 yards (25.5 avg) and a pair of scores. He also had a 68-yard touchdown on a reception and gained nine yards on a punt return."

Shows good ability to close and make tackles in the open field...One of the hardest workers on the team, reminding some of the Rams' Corey Chavous for how quickly he grasps the playbook and has learned the game in such a short time...Plays with good effort and intensity, bringing his arms with force to wrap and secure the ballcarrier on the perimeter, staying low in his pads to take out the opponent's outside leg...Even though he lacks height, he tracks the ball well in flight, showing elevation and extension to high point the pass, secure the ball and elude opponents for additional yardage on the interception runback...Takes good angles and uses his hands effectively to defeat blocks, avoid trash and make the play inside the box...Can impact an opponent with crunching hits and does a good job breaking down in space...Very quick to diagnose the quarterback's moves in the backfield, showing valid instincts and awareness in his charge toward the ball...Takes proper angles in pursuit, sliding down the line while keeping his shoulders square...Has enough agility to get to the flat and has a good feel in his pass drops to gain leverage...Shows sharp ball anticipation skills working in the zone...Has soft, natural hands for the interception...Efficient and disruptive blitzer who will force things to happen when closing on the quarterback.\r"

He originally signed with the University of Mississippi, but after performing on the scout team his first year, the team's Academic Honor Roll selection was hoping to wrest a starting job in 2004. When he was limited to just brief appearances that year, finishing with three tackles, he left the school.\r\nMoore transferred to Itawamba Community College in 2005 and then moved on to McNeese State in 2006. He earned Southland Conference Newcomer of the Year honors as a junior, establishing himself as one of the best free safeties in the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision ranks. He capped his career by winning the league's Defensive Player of the Year Award as a senior.\r\nMoore began his football career late in life, but made a big impact during his senior season at Okolona High School. He was selected to the Class 2A Super 24 team, Northeast\r\nMississippi Daily Journal All-Area team, Rivals.com Mississippi Top 30 list and named Best Defensive Back in Region 1-2A. He was selected to play in the 2003 Bernard Blackwell Classic, the Mississippi High School All-Star Game.\r\nAs a senior, Moore had 38 receptions for 842 yards and eight touchdowns on offense. He also recorded 30 tackles and seven interceptions with three punt returns for touchdowns. He earned three letters in basketball and two in track. \r\nMoore helped lead the basketball team to a 34-5 record and the Class 2A title, as he averaged 15 points, nine rebounds, seven assists, three steals and two blocks. He earned All-State, All-Division and Best Defensive Player honors in basketball. Academically, he was a Physics Award recipient and was named Pizza Hut Student of the Month.\r\nMoore enrolled at Mississippi in 2003, red-shirting on the scout team as a cornerback. He moved to free safety the following year (wore jersey #22), but in 11 games, he came up with only three solo tackles. At Itawamba Community College in 2005, he collected 37 tackles (30 solos) with three pass break-ups while starting seven games at free safety.\r\nOnce again on the move, the Southland Conference Newcomer of the Year and All-Southland pick started all 11 games at free safety for Nicholls State in 2006. He ranked third on the team with 68 tackles (35 solos), including a stop for a loss and a forced fumble. He picked off a pass and deflected three others. He also averaged 20.4 yards on seven kickoff returns and 9.1 yards on 10 punt returns.\r\nMoore was an Associated Press All-American second-team, All-Southland Conference first-team and league Player of the Year in 2007. He appeared in 10 games, leading the team with 73 tackles (46 solos), as he had 4.5 stops for losses, a fumble recovery and a forced fumble. He broke up three passes and picked off two others, returning two of those interceptions for touchdowns.\r\nIn 21 games at Nicholls State, Moore started 17 contests.

Like Mathis, his technique is very raw and he will need a total refinement of his pass rush moves and hand usage. He is too high cut to get a good anchor, as he plays at a highly elevated pad level.

Plays with an inconsistent motor and his frame seems to be too high cut for him to sink his pads well, as he aligns with too high of a pad level...Will get frustrated when his initial move fails, giving up on the play. The disturbing part is that when that happens, he will turn his back and allow the blocker to clear him out of the hole.",

Wasn't a great worker early in his career, but has improved, giving good effort as he has become a respected and vocal team leader...Wide-body type who is able to maintain position and sustain his blocks while trapping...Stays up on his blocks, displaying good pop in his hand thrusts coming out of his stance...Has a good set base, but must improve his ability to drop his hips properly to lock on and engage...Despite his size, he shows the good finesse as a pass protector with proper arm extension when battling the edge rushers."

                "Overview": "The UCF coaching staff looked at Sitton's ability last season and felt he was their most versatile player. Because of injuries up front, he started the team's first six games at his familiar right tackle position. He then shifted to left guard vs. Tulsa, played the next three games at right guard and then returned to right tackle for the rest of the schedule.\nThe moves had little affect on Sitton, as he not only earned All-Conference USA honors, but greatly impressed pro scouts with his ability to acclimate to all of those changes. It seemed like those moves were a stroke of genius by the staff, as Sitton's drive blocking saw UCF improve its ground game from an average of 139.4 yards per game with 11 touchdowns in 2006, to ranking ninth in the nation while leading the conference with an average of 234.79 yards per contest, producing 41 scores on the ground last year.\nAt Pensacola Catholic High, Sitton lettered three seasons on the offensive line for head coach Michael Smith. He was named second-team All-State as a senior, adding All-Area first-team accolades. He allowed just three sacks during his last two seasons on the offensive line. He also played on the defensive front wall as a senior, recording more than 50 tackles and six sacks.\nAs a true freshman at Central Florida, Sitton started four of the 11 games he appeared in at right guard. He took over right tackle chores as a sophomore, starting every game. He had the highest blocking grades among the team's linemen, helping the offense average 401.3 yards per game.\nAs a junior, Sitton was again stationed at right tackle, leading the UCF blockers in the grading department. He allowed only two sacks on 381 pass plays and paved the way for the team to generate 4,478 yards, an average of 373.2 yards per game.\nThe All-Conference USA selection's ability to play anywhere the coaches needed him on the offensive line helped the ground game tremendously. With 3,287 yards on the ground, the Golden Knights were not a one-dimensional team. Sitton's pass protection skills were also evident, as the team gained 2,476 passing yards, an average of 176.9 yards per game."

Just a few years later, he left Virginia after starting all 37 games in which he played for the Cavaliers. \r\nWith a blend of athletic ability, size and strength at the point of attack, he quickly developed into one of the elite offensive guards in college football.\r\nAlbert first starred in basketball at Glen Burnie High School. He averaged 15.5 points and 10.6 rebounds per game as a senior, earning second-team All-Metro honors from the Baltimore Sun. He scored nine points for the Baltimore All-Stars at the Marines Charm City Challenge.\r\nAs a junior, the football staff convinced him to give football a try. He went on to start as a two-way tackle, picking up first-team All-Metro accolades as an offensive lineman by the Baltimore Sun as a senior, as he also delivered 65 tackles on defense. He also earned first-team All-Anne Arundel County honors by the Baltimore Sun in 2003 and was rated the 38th-best offensive lineman in the country by Scout.com.\r\nAlbert enrolled at Hargrave Military Academy to improve his academic standing in 2004. The offensive tackle received a four-star rating from Rivals.com, a service that ranked him 12th among the top 25 prep school players in the nation. \r\nUpon his arrival at Virginia in 2005, Albert was inserted into the starting lineup at left offensive guard. He received Freshman All-American third-team and Freshman All-Atlantic Coast Conference first team recognition from The Sporting News. In just his third college game, he garnered ACC Lineman of the Week honors for his performance vs. Duke. When he answered the opening gun for the Music City Bowl vs. Minnesota, he became the fourth true freshman offensive lineman in school history to start a bowl contest.\r\nVirginia had many offensive struggles in 2006 (ranked 113th in the nation with an average of 257.2 yards per game) and the collective play of the offensive line (ranked 104th in the nation in sacks allowed; 35), but Albert was named All-Atlantic Coast Conference honorable mention. He was an ACC Lineman of the Week pick for his performance vs. North Carolina State and recorded 40 knockdown blocks while allowing just one sack to finish with an 82.9% grade for blocking consistency.\r\nAs a junior, Albert earned All-American third-team and All-ACC first-team accolades. He started 11 games at left offensive guard and lined up at left tackle vs. Pittsburgh and Middle Tennessee. He twice earned Lineman of the Week honors (vs. North Carolina and Wake Forest), registering 54 knockdowns with 12 touchdown-resulting blocks, but did give up 5.5 of the team's 33 sacks allowed.\r\nAfter the Gator Bowl, Albert announced that he would bypass his senior year to enter the 2008 NFL Draft. He did not submit his paperwork to the NFL advisory committee that predicts where underclassmen might be drafted if they leave school early. \"I would rather go off Coach Al Groh than anybody, because he's a great resource,\" Albert said. \"I feel like he cares about me, that he would tell me what I need to know, not what I want to hear. He won't tell me his own selfish reasons to either stay or go.\""

                "Overview": "Ever since his arrival on campus, the Commodores felt Earl Bennett was the most dangerous weapon in the Southeastern Conference. By earning All-SEC honors in each of his three college seasons, Bennett became just the second player in school history to accomplish the feat, joining linebacker Jamie Winborn (1998-2000). \r\nBennett is ready to test his big-play ability in the National Football League ranks.\r\nIn three seasons in Nashville, Bennett shattered most of the school's single-game, season and career receiving records. His 236 receptions also established a new all-time conference record. He became the sixth player in school annals to lead the team in receptions in three-straight years, joining Bucky Curtis (1948-50), Jeff Starling (1960-62), Curt Chesley (1968-71), Martin Cox (1976-78) and Dan Stricker (2000-02).\r\nAt West End High School, Bennett served as team captain, starting at wide receiver, running back and cornerback for an 8-3 squad that advanced to the Class 5A state playoffs as a senior. He was named the City of Birmingham's Most Valuable Football Player and Most Outstanding Athlete and selected first-team 5A All-State by the Alabama Sports Writers Association.\r\nBennett also received the Birmingham City Player of the Year Award and All-Birmingham Metro recognition. He rushed for 829 yards and 12 touchdowns and caught 45 passes for 729 yards during his final year. He also intercepted 10 passes and totaled 52 tackles at cornerback. He also lettered in basketball, averaging 11.2 points per game as the squad's point guard. He excelled in the classroom, graduating with a 3.82 grade point average.\r\nBennett made an immediate impact at Vanderbilt. Even though he did not start until the fourth game of 2005, he set the school and Southeastern Conference freshman season-record with 79 receptions, good for 876 yards. His average of 7.18 catches per game ranked ninth in the nation, and he added 76 yards on 12 punt returns while averaging 21.3 yards on 19 kickoff returns. \r\nHis freshman postseason was a busy one, as Bennett garnered Freshman All-American and Freshman All-SEC honors from The Sporting News, and was the recipient of the squad's Most Valuable Receiver Award. He added first-team All-SEC (all classes) accolades from the league's coaches and received second-team mention from the Associated Press.\r\nFor the second straight season, Bennett was named first team All-SEC by the league's coaches and received the team's Most Valuable Receiver Award. He was tied for eighth nationally with a career-high 82 receptions, the second-best season total in school annals. He gained 1,146 yards, ranking ninth in the nation with an average of 95.5 yards per game. He completed two pass attempts for 45 yards and a score, finishing with 1,190 all-purpose yards.\r\nAs a junior, Bennett received All-SEC first-team notice for the third time. He ranked second in the conference with 75 receptions for 830 yards (11.1-yard average) and five touchdowns while playing flanker and slot receiver. He also rushed 10 times for 22 yards.\r\nBennett declared for the 2008 NFL Draft, deciding not to return to Vanderbilt for his senior season. \r\nIn 35 games at Vanderbilt, Bennett started his final 32 contests. He totaled 2,852 yards on an SEC all-time record 236 catches (12.1-yard average) with 20 touchdowns. He carried 20 times for 44 yards (2.2 avg), returned 25 punts for 181 yards (7.2 avg) and completed 2-of-4 passes for 45 yards and a score.

He has the long reach and good explosion off the ball to demand constant double-team activity in attempts to block him. The losses seemed to wear on him late in his junior year and while 2007 could be labeled as a disappointment for both him and the entire team, he has that rare-sized frame with great athletic talent to be an impact player in the right scheme. He is best when on the move rather than battling in-line for position and, unlike Jaguars' DT John Henderson, a former college defensive end, he does not show the blow-up strength needed to take on multiple blockers as a tackle. He has the frame to get even bigger and stronger. While his size is an asset in certain areas, he does not always keep his pad level down and could be washed out by a strong double team. If his evaluation was based solely on 2006, rather than a less-than-stellar second half of 2007, he will be one of the first defensive ends on every team's draft board.",

                "Overview": "The tallest defensive lineman to suit up for the Hurricanes, Campbell was regarded as the premier defensive end in college football entering the 2007 season. The Hurricanes' defense struggled, as did Campbell, and the team lost six of their final seven games. \r\nCampbell produced pedestrian numbers rather than dominating the action in the trenches as expected.\r\nOriginally recruited as a tight end because of his athletic ability, Campbell took over starting duties on the right side of the defensive line as a sophomore. He put together a streak of seven consecutive games with at least one quarterback sack as a junior, the second-longest streak in school history. His 10 1/2 sacks in 2006 were the most by a Hurricane since Derrick Ham posted 12 sacks in 1998 and it ranks tied for eighth on the school's season-record list.\r\nCampbell comes from a family with deep roots in football. His younger brother, Jared, is a 2007 recruit at Miami and his older brother, Ciare was a defensive back at Colorado State (2004-05). Another brother (Raj) played football at Butte and Orange County Junior Colleges and is presently a receiver at Adams State.\r\nAt Denver's South High School, Campbell was a standout rush end and tight end. He was rated the 11th-best football player in the country by Super Prep, earning All-American and Elite 50 honors from that recruiting service. Super Prep also rated him the second-best prospect in the state of Colorado, awarding him Midlands Defensive Player of the Year accolades in 2003.\r\nCampbell was listed on Tom Lemming's Prep Football Report National Top 100 and ranked as the nation's 11th-best defensive end. The two-time All-State pick as a junior and senior, he also played offensive tackle as a sophomore and tight end his final two years. He set a state career-record with 58 sacks during his four-year career, including 38 over his final two seasons.\r\nAs a senior, Campbell registered 19 sacks 118 total tackles, three knockdowns and two interceptions. On offense, he had 38 receptions for 412 yards with four touchdowns, including 68- and 72-yarders on tight end screens. As a junior, he posted 19 sacks, 109 tackles and five touchdowns off blocked kicks and fumble returns, in addition to blocking three punts, adding three receptions for 56 yards.\r\nCampbell was an accomplished all-around athlete who was an All-State basketball choice as a junior (the only non-senior chosen) in 2002-03. He averaged 22.7 points (fourth-best in Colorado) and led the state in rebounding (16.0 per game) and blocked shots (3.3 per game) as a junior. He also competed in track and field, qualifying for the state meet in the discus and shot put in 2003. His track and field personal bests included 21 feet in the long jump, 48-feet-1 in the shot put, 135-0 in the discus, and 44-2 in the triple-jump.\r\nCampbell enrolled at Miami in 2004, declining offers from Colorado State, Nebraska, Louisiana State, Michigan and Oklahoma. He spent his first season on the scout team and was a reserve right defensive end in 2005, playing in 11 games. He started vs. Louisiana State in the Peach Bowl, finishing the campaign with 24 tackles (15 solo), 2 1/2 sacks, six stops for losses and eight quarterback pressures.\r\nAs a sophomore, Campbell earned team MVP honors, in addition to picking up first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference recognition. He took over right defensive end duties, leading the team and ranking seventh nationally with 20 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage, as he finished 15th in the nation with 10 1/2 sacks. He posted 55 tackles (38 solo) with 17 pressures and caused three fumbles while deflecting four passes.\r\nA preseason All-American and favorite to win the Ted Hendricks Award (nation's top defensive end), Campbell fared no better than the Hurricanes. Miami got off to a 4-1 start under new head coach Randy Shannon, as the right defensive end registered 25 tackles (16 solos) with 4 1/2 sacks, seven stops for losses, three pressures, two forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries and an interception during that span.\r\nHowever, in the team's final seven contests, he delivered just 25 tackles (14 solos), 1 1/2 sacks, 5 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage and two pressures. He was an honorable mention All-Atlantic Coast Conference pick, as he ended the year with six sacks, 12 1/2 stops for losses and 50 tackles (30 solo).\r\nAt the end of his junior campaign, Campbell decided it was time to test his skills in the National Football League and declared for the 2008 draft. \r\nIn 36 games at Miami, Campbell started 25 contests. He finished his career with 158 tackles (83 solos), 19 1/2 sacks for minus-119 yards, 39 stops for losses of 146 yards and 30 quarterback pressures. He caused six fumbles, recovered three others and also deflected nine passes. He had a 1-yard interception return and caught a pass for five yards."

Works to finish blocks with a good base (rare to see his feet get narrow or stand too tall)...More of a position blocker than a physical one...Alert to twists and games, sliding his feet well retreating to protect the pocket vs. the blitz...Works well in concert with his guards to neutralize in-line action...Has that long arm reach to extend, lock on and wall off his man with a quick burst coming out of his stance...Has good lateral agility on the short pulls and keeps his hands active, displaying good recoil action...Made good strides as a junior in learning how to properly grab and punch in order to stun defenders...With his reach, he generates good lock out and works hard to maintain separation...Plays with good patience, as it is rare to see him lunge at a defender... Extends his arms properly and sinks his hips in order to consistently lock on and ride his man wide...Has a quick burst out of his stance to leverage and is capable of delivering a crunching hand jolt to get under the defender's pads and sustain...Shows good footwork and shuffling ability to wall off and screen in run protection...Fires out quickly, making good body adjustments when pulling upfield...Shows good aggression in his pass set and is quick to shuffle back to neutralize the edge rush (can be beaten by a speedy pass rusher when he tries to overpower rather than mirror, though)...Has solid recovery skills sliding back to provide a base in pass protection...Has made good strides in handling double moves, but must anchor better vs. the inside surge...Demonstrates proper arm extension, walling off his man while keeping his feet flat and his base narrow...His quickness and leg drive allow him to take good angles and neutralize linebackers when firing out to the second level...Follows through with his hand punch to insure the defender will not make a play...Shows the lateral agility and slide to be very effective leading on sweeps...Quick in his retreat, showing proper wingspan form to pick up the blitz...Comes off the ball hard and has the body control to execute blocks in space...Smooth in his movements when blocking on traps, showing good hip snap to adjust and make contact on the move...Can shuffle and slide efficiently, staying square and balanced in his pass set while showing the athletic ability to recover when beaten.\r"

The Broncos were the lone major college pursuing him, and Clady figured that he would at least get a good education at the university. After spending a year on the scout team, the staff moved him to the offensive line. And like a fish in water, the talented youngster started to develop almost immediately.\r\nClady would go on to earn Freshman All-American honors as a redshirt freshman and earn All-American recognition, along with a slew of other honors over his next two seasons. What impressed scouts about, beyond his developing frame, was his knowledge and technique at left offensive tackle. \r\nWatch game film on Clady to see a smooth kick slide in pass protection, his light feet leading on traps and pulls and, of course, a devastating hand punch. With his footwork and balance, he has easily neutralized quicker edge rushers on a regular basis.\r\nAt Eisenhower High School, Clady earned first-team All-CVL honors, as well as first-team All-County and All-CIF Division recognition. Competing as a defensive lineman, he posted 60 tackles, five sacks and one fumble recovery during his senior year.\r\nWith Boise State, Clady spent the 2004 season as a defensive tackle on the scout team as a freshman. His epic battles vs. All-Western Athletic Conference offensive tackle Daryn Colledge in practices are the stuff of legend in Boise. Colledge graduated and the coaches shifted Clady to the offensive line, where he started 11 of 13 games at right tackle, helping the team rank ninth in the nation in scoring (36.08 points per game) and fifth in rushing touchdowns (36).\r\nClady, with a year of experience on offense under his belt, took over left tackle duties in 2006, going on to earn second-team All-American honors. He registered 102 knockdowns with 11 touchdown-resulting blocks, finishing with an 82.23% grade for blocking consistency. He paced a unit that ranked sixth nationally in rushing (214.15 yards per game), second in rushing touchdowns (39) and second in scoring (39.69 points per game).\r\nClady was primed for a banner 2007 campaign, but he got off to a very rough start, as he was penalized four times in the season's second game vs. Washington and struggled a bit with his footwork. He did post some eye-opening performances, putting together a string of three games where he did not allow the opponent to record any statistics. He finished the year with 122 knockdowns, leading the nation's blockers with 21 touchdown-resulting blocks to grade 85.77%.\r\nAfter the 2007 Hawaii Bowl, Clady decided to turn pro."

He is a dangerous scrambler who is showing much better patience in the pocket and better confidence in his ability. He is using his fine peripheral vision to make better checks and progression reads and no longer plays with an attitude that he has to make something spectacular happen on every play. He still needs to be conscious of stepping into his long throws better, but unlike another Oregon one-season wonder, Akili Smith, Dixon appears to have more value as an athlete and a better concept of how to execute a game plan.",
                    "Negatives": "Needs to add more bulk to his frame in order to absorb punishment in the pocket at the professional level...Did not communicate well with the previous offensive coordinator, but the arrival of Chip Kelly as the team's new coordinator and quarterbacks coach saw the staff cater their game plan to Dixon's assets...Threw under duress frequently in the past and was too jittery in the pocket, but he learned to take time to make his reads and checks and will throw the ball away rather than try to create something out of nothing...Not known as a \"gym rat\" in the offseason training room and needs monitoring in order to do the little extras, but the new offensive coordinator had him more involved in the game planning than the past regime...Can throw on the move, but must be alert to setting his feet and stepping into those throws, or it will affect his accuracy...When he throws across his body or off the wrong foot, his passes tend to spray, causing his targets to adjust off their routes...As a junior, he was always waiting for the \"hook\" from the coaching staff and lost confidence in his ability to read coverage and would force the ball too often, especially on deep routes (had five games with multiple interceptions)...In the past, he did not always follow through when throwing deep, as he had a bit of a long throwing arc...Under the old coordinator, he looked very skittish standing in the pocket and would bolt at the first sign of pressure...Doctors anticipate he will need a minimum of six months to recover from December left knee anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery, making it hard for teams to get a good evaluation on his recovery leading up to the April draft...The injury could possibly make him reconsider his career path, as he is already property of the Atlanta Braves baseball organization. (In a late November interview after his injury, the QB was asked about whether he would play baseball or football and responded, \"I'll talk with my family at the end of the season,\" Dixon said. \"I'll see what my (NFL draft) forecast is and how I do at the various evaluations and talk to my family.

                "Overview": "After biding his time as the Oregon backup, Dennis Dixon was firmly entrenched as the Ducks' starter in 2007, when he gained national recognition as he returned Oregon to be ranked among the nation's elite. But after lifting Oregon to a prominent BCS position, Dixon suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. \r\nDixon tried to play one week after suffering the injury against Arizona State, but was forced to the sideline against Arizona, missing the team's final three games. \r\nDespite his injury, Dixon was named Pac-10 Conference Offensive Player of the Year. Until he was hurt, he was considered a favorite for the Heisman Trophy. \r\nDixon was named one of three finalists for both the Maxwell Award and the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award in 2007. In addition, he was selected as one of 15 National Scholar-Athletes by The National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame and is a finalist for the Foundation's Draddy Trophy. Ever the team-first athlete, he rejoined the squad as a student assistant coach, mentoring his replacements at quarterback during the final weeks of his college career.\r\nOne of the most mobile passers to play at the university, few quarterbacks in school history displayed the explosiveness or versatility of Dixon. He demonstrated the physical gifts consistent with \"special\" players and possesses a great arm, erasing the misconception that his passing skills were marginal compared to his running ability. \r\nIn the 2005 offseason winter conditioning program, Dixon posted the fastest clocking in the 40-yard dash (4.49) of any quarterback in the history of the Oregon program. His 3.81 timing in the 20-yard shuttle during spring drills in 2007 was the third-fastest mark among Oregon all-time passers. He also displayed impressive strength during his senior year, improving his power clean to 264 pounds and was also timed at 6.91 seconds in the three-cone drill.\r\nAt San Leandro High School, Dixon was a two-sport standout, excelling in football and baseball. He was the top vote-getter (eight votes) among quarterbacks on the Long Beach Press-Telegram's Best of the West list and earned Parade All-American honors as a senior, leading the team to an 11-1 record in 2002. That year, he completed 164 of 268 passes (61.2%) for 2,736 yards and 30 touchdowns.\r\nThe three-year starter compiled a 36-3 record and was named to ESPN's Top 100 team (ranked 94th overall and 12th at quarterback). During his career, he amassed 5,951 aerial yards while throwing for 79 touchdowns. He was regarded as one of the state's best prep outfielders in baseball and was selected in the 20th round of the 2003 major league baseball draft by the Cincinnati Reds.\r\nDixon decided to take a year off from academics after graduating from high school in 2003 and did not enroll at the University of Oregon until the 2004 winter semester. He played in six games that season, as a reserve behind Kellen Clemens. He hit on 6-of-15 throws (40.0%) for 73 yards and carried ten times for 40 yards. He also recorded an assisted tackle.\r\nDixon garnered Academic All-Pac-10 Conference honorable mention in 2005. He struggled initially after replacing an injured Kellen Clemens in the starting lineup for four games and appeared in 11 contests. The sophomore managed 777 yards with six touchdowns and three interceptions on 69-of-104 attempts (66.3%). He accounted for 143 yards and a score on 49 rushes (2.9-yard average) and participated in 153 plays, gaining 920 yards in total offense.\r\nDixon was again an Academic All-Pac-10 Conference choice, this time earning second-team honors. He started the first 11 games, but suffered a concussion vs. Arizona that forced him to sit out vs. Oregon State and into reserve duty vs. Brigham Young in the Las Vegas Bowl. He connected on 197-of-322 tosses (61.2%) for 2,143 yards, 12 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. \r\nDixon had a string of pass attempts without an interception that began during his sophomore year snapped at 161 in the third game of 2006. He also showed his mobility, ranking third on the team with 98 carries for 442 yards (4.7-yard average) and two scores. He posted two solo tackles and generated 2,585 yards in total offense on 416 plays.\r\nWith his first season as a starter complete, Dixon returned a much different, more confident player in 2007. Prior to his injury, he led the Pac-10 in passing efficiency by completing 172-of-254 passes (67.7%) for 2,136 yards and 20 touchdowns with just four interceptions. He also was dangerous as a runner with 105 rushes for 583 yards (5.6-yard average) and nine touchdowns. \r\nUnder Dixon's direction, Oregon led the Pac-10 in both scoring offense (36.7) and total offense (462.1). He was named Pac-10 offensive player of the week three times this season following Oregon victories vs. Michigan, Stanford and Arizona State. He ranked fourth nationally in passing efficiency, a key statistical benchmark for quarterbacks, and had directed Oregon's spread-option offense so well that the Ducks were ranked second in the Bowl Championship Series standings, putting them in position to possibly play for the national title. \r\nWith Dixon sidelined, the offense struggled, losing three of their final four contests. \r\nIn 39 games at Oregon, Dixon started 25 times. He registered 5,129 yards with 38 touchdowns and 21 interceptions on 444-of-695 passes (63.88%). He rushed 258 times for 1,208 yards (4.7-yard average) and 12 scores and also recorded three tackles (two solo). He participated in 953 offensive snaps, gaining 6,337 yards in total offense (162.49 yards per game). He was sacked a total of 24 times for losses of 131 yards and turned the ball over five times on 14 fumbles."

Flowers hits hard and shows natural hands to come up with the interception. He is very good at disrupting a receiver's route progression and will deflect a lot of passes. To some, he lacks ideal size, but look Barber has been a successful cornerback and sure tackler despite his frame. Flowers is cut from the same cloth. Some people talk about durability concerns, but that appears to be a non-issue -- he's been on the field for every game since breaking his right leg in 2004.",
                    "Negatives": "Negatives...Plays with total aggression in his game, but gets so caught up in trying to overpower the opponent at times that he fails to properly wrap and secure...Will go vertical to make the tackle, needs to play with better control, as his recklessness leads to several missed tackles...Has good timed speed, but his recovery skills are just adequate, as he gets caught out of position, especially vs. double moves, and takes time to recover...Has good leaping ability, but must work on his timing a bit, as he lost several jump balls he should have won in 2007...More of a collision-type tackler and when he tries to bite at the ankles, ballcarriers have had success side-stepping...His timed speed does not always translate to the field, especially when a receiver gets behind him (needs to show more consistency using his second gear).\r",
                    "Positives": "Compact build, with a well-defined upper and lower body...Has a very strong hand grip, taking advantage of it to deliver a jarring jolt to the receivers in press coverage...Agile with quick feet and good change-of-direction agility...Will get a bit reckless and overpursue, struggling to recover, but he does have the valid speed to stay with the receiver when mirroring...Smart, instinctive player who makes proper reads and knows his responsibilities coming up in run force...Uses his hands with good force to reroute in man coverage and shows explosive hitting ability, squaring his shoulders, staying low in his pads and driving with his legs to impede the ballcarrier's forward progress in outside run support...Has good acceleration planting and driving out of his backpedal and shows good discipline and movement skills, sticking tight with the receivers by using rapid feet in transition, excellent balance and good body control throughout the route progression...When he plays in control, he shows the ability to jump and anticipate the route...Likes to press better than he likes to play off the receiver, but takes his opponent out of rhythm (just needs to recover when he loses position)...Uses both the classic backpedal and shuffle-and-slide technique, but there is no wasted motion coming out of his breaks...Does a nice job of picking up receivers in the zone and is a forceful tackler who takes proper angles in order to spring into his hits...Stays low in his stance, displaying fluid hip swerve and head-turning abilities to track the ball in flight...Can transition and burst to make the play on the ball...Has natural hands and very good lift going up for the ball in traffic, much like a receiver, resulting in more than a fair share of interceptions and pass deflections...Will get burned on a go route when he gets a bit reckless, but will generally stay on the receiver's hip and shadow...Breaks sharply toward the ball and will not shy away from contact near the line of scrimmage...Shows an explosive burst off the edge as a blitzer and is fearless tackling -- his hits stand out on tape...Plays bigger than his size indicates and has no problem selling out to break up the pass...The type of player that usually takes good angles out of his breaks and shows good ability to adjust to the ball on the move (six of his interceptions came over his shoulder)...Adept at avoiding blockers and extends his arms properly to secure the receiver after the catch...Fluid in reverse and excels getting in to break up the slant patterns...Aggressive in run support and has a knack for penetrating the line to get to the ballcarrier, recording more stops behind the line of scrimmage than any other Tech defensive back in memory...Shows very loose hips to turn and run after the ballcarrier when playing along the perimeter...Very active taking on bigger blockers and, even if he gets washed out on the play, he will battle until the whistle...Will break down, face up and wrap to tackle and has the strength to impact playing off the edge and the short-area burst to pressure the pocket when blitzing.\r"

He's also regarded as one of the hardest hitters at his position. \r\nA student of the game who spends plenty of time in the film room and is effective in both man and zone coverage.\r\nFlowers' size makes it difficult to believe the impact he puts behind his tackles. He has studied NFL cornerbacks to learn how passing teams attack a secondary.\r\nLast offseason, while reviewing his own game film, Flowers noticed that he looked into the backfield too often before the wide receiver he was assigned to made a cut. Flowers improved his hip rotation and now plants his back foot when a receiver makes a break. \r\nFor Flowers, 2007 turned into another All-American campaign. Despite opposing quarterbacks making a determined effort to stay away from Flowers' territory, he still managed to intercept five passes and deflect nine others. His ability to anticipate the quarterback and get a jump on the route saw the boundary cornerback finish his career with 10 interceptions and 32 pass breakups.\r\nAt Atlantic High School, Flowers helped his team to a regional title in Class 5A his senior year, beating highly rated Ely High. He intercepted five passes and posted three sacks, as he also blocked a punt and recovered a pair of fumbles. For that performance, he earned first-team All-Area and All-Conference honors. Atlantic High would compile a 36-4 record during his varsity career.\r\nFlowers attended Hargrave Military Academy to improve his academics. He was rated the 18th-best junior college or prep cornerback in the nation by College Football News, as he intercepted three passes as a cornerback.\r\nHe enrolled at Virginia Tech in 2004. He did not play in the season opener vs. Southern California, but made a spectacular interception for a 38-yard return the following week vs. Western Michigan. He suffered a fractured right fibula later in the contest and missed the rest of the season.\r\nFlowers returned to action in 2005, starting vs. Marshall while spending the rest of the year behind Jimmy Williams at boundary cornerback. He posted 20 tackles (13 solo) with four pass deflections, 1 1/2 stops behind the line of scrimmage and an interception. \r\nIn 2006, Flowers took over the boundary cornerback spot, going on to start his final 27 games with the Hokies. He earned All-American second-team and All-Atlantic Coast Conference first-team honors, leading the league with 21 passes defended, breaking up 18 throws and picking off three others. He totaled 51 tackles (29 solo) with 3.5 sacks and 7.5 stops for losses. He also caused a fumble and did not allow an opponent to catch any passes in three games.\r\nAs a junior, Flowers again received All-American and All-ACC recognition. Most quarterbacks steered clear of his area, but Flowers intercepted five passes and broke up nine others in 14 games. He ranked third on the team with 86 tackles (56 solo), including a very impressive eight stops behind the line of scrimmage in 2007.\r\nIn 41 games at Virginia Tech, Flowers started 28 contests at boundary cornerback, making 158 tackles (99 solo) with 3.5 sacks for minus-28 yards, 17 stops for losses of 71 yards and six quarterback pressures. He caused and recovered a fumble, deflected 32 passes and intercepted ten others for 172 yards in returns and two touchdowns."

                "Overview": "Vernon Gholston is a remarkable talent, but he's only just begun realizing his vast potential. \r\nHe never picked up a football until his sophomore year in high school and had just one season of defensive experience as a linebacker before being converted to defensive end when he arrived at Ohio State.\r\nBlessed with incredible speed (clocked at 4.56 in the 40-yard dash), long limbs and superb strength, Gholston is the prototype pass rusher that professional teams look for -- big, fast, strong and explosive. An avid performer in the weight room, he boasted the best bench press on the team at 455 pounds. He also put on an impressive performance for teammates, squatting 405 pounds 20 times.\r\nHow Gholston was lured into football will one day make a nice story, if he becomes the legendary pass rusher many personnel experts are predicting. Walking in the halls of Cass Technical High School, football coach Thomas Wilcher spotted the 14-year-old strapping youngster, who stood 6-3, 240 pounds at the time. He convinced the player to join the football team.\r\nGholston was too big to play in Detroit's Police Athletic League and the elementary public schools did not offer an organized football program. From the first time he ever stepped on the field, the coaching staff knew they had a natural talent. \r\nAs a sophomore at Cass Tech, Gholston was first tried at linebacker, but he was overwhelmed by the plays he needed to know to play that position. One of the offensive coaches \"stole\" the youngster away from the defensive squad and had him play offensive guard as a sophomore. His junior campaign was limited by ankle sprains, which forced him to stay on the offensive line and scrap plans to also play linebacker.\r\nBy his senior season, he had already earned All-State honors as an offensive lineman and gained experience playing linebacker for the first time in his career. In just one season on defense, he was regarded as one of the best linebackers in the Midwest region. He would go on to record 75 tackles with six sacks in his final season, as Rivals.com rated him the 11th-best defensive end prospect in the nation and the 12th-best overall prospect in the state of Michigan.\r\nGholston enrolled at Ohio State, becoming the only player from Michigan on the squad. He turned down scholarship offers from Michigan, Michigan State and Iowa to join the Buckeyes. The coaching staff immediately began giving him a crash course in playing the \"Leo\" position, which incorporates dropping into pass coverage and rushing the passer from either side of the field.\r\nHe mentored under Mike Kudla his first year with the team, appearing in six games as a true freshman in 2004, but did not record a tackle. In 2005, a broken hand suffered in the second game vs. Texas earned Gholston a medical hardship. He had one tackle in that game and spent the rest of the year on the sideline.\r\nGholston used that time wisely in the weight room, bulking up from 238 to 264 pounds, as he took over \"Leo\" duties in 2006. He garnered All-Big Ten Conference second-team honors, as he ranked fourth in the league with 15 stops for losses of 86 yards and was fifth in the Big Ten with 8.5 sacks. He added a quarterback pressure with two pass breakups and an interception. He also finished sixth on the squad with 49 tackles (21 solo).\r\nIn 2007, Gholston earned All-American recognition and was a finalist for the Ted Hendricks Award, given to the nation's top defensive end. He posted 37 tackles (25 solo) and was a terror in the backfield, ranking eighth in the nation with 15.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage and second nationally with 14 sacks. He also scooped up a fumble and returned it for a 25-yard touchdown.\r\nIn 34 games at Ohio State, Gholston started 25 times. He registered 87 tackles (47 solo) with 22.5 sacks for minus-184 yards and 30.5 stops for losses of 199 yards. He had two pass deflections and an eight-yard interception return, as he also recovered a fumble that he returned 25 yards for a touchdown."

But it is evident that he is a rare athlete with good speed and a developing frame. Put him in the weight room for a year, work on his zone blocking technique and along with his quickness, you could unearth a solid right tackle with good reach blocking skills. He's certainly worth a long look, as few tackles have his athletic ability.

                "Overview": "Because of his rare quickness and natural hands, the staff bounced Giacomini back and forth between tight end an offensive tackle during his Cardinals playing days. The one constant was his consistent performance, no matter what task he was asked to perform.\r\nA big, physical player, Giacomini began his career at tight end, starting four games at that position during his first two collegiate seasons. He shifted to left tackle as a junior, earning a pair of starts. He then found a home at right tackle, where he excelled as a 12-game starter in 2007.\r\nAt Malden High School, Giacomini was a three-year starter as a defensive end and outside linebacker. He led the team in passes defended and recorded one interception, earning Greater Boston League All-Star honors. He started his freshman and sophomore years, but didn't play football as a junior to concentrate on basketball, as he averaged 21.0 points per game as a senior and was second in the league in scoring.\r\nDespite having experience on defense, the coaches were so impressed with Giacomini's speed and catching ability, that they shifted him to tight end as a true freshman at Louisville. He appeared in eight games that year, catching a 3-yard pass vs. Army. The following season, he started vs. West Virginia and Virginia Tech at tight end coming up with three receptions for 16 yards (5.3 avg) and a touchdown.\r\nBy the time he reported for fall camp in 2006, Giacomini had grown from a 242-pound tight end, forcing the staff to move him to the offensive line. He played behind George Bussey at left tackle in 11 games, starting vs. Kansas State and Middle Tennessee State when Bussey was injured. He also recorded a solo tackle vs. Syracuse.\r\nGiacomini made the most of his opportunity to start, earning second-team All-Big East Conference honors after moving to right tackle in 2007. The ground game struggled, but he provided solid pass protection, allowing four sacks and two pressures on 491 pass plays."

                    "Positives": "Lacks ideal size and has a lean, angular frame, but has the long reach and large hands to be disruptive competing for the ball in flight...Plays with nice effort and aggression and despite size and power issues, he will face up and take on bigger blockers, but is best when making plays on the move rather than getting into one-on-one battles...More explosive than he is strong when generating a tackle (loses some power because of his size, but has natural pop on contact)...Has a good passion for the game and is a self-starter in the training room...Plays with natural linebacker instincts and awareness, reacting quickly and tracking the flow of the ball well, when he is not tied up trying to get through trash...Has the short-area burst to hunt up the ball...Shows just adequate use of his hands in attempts to shed, but when he uses his long reach effectively he can stave off the smaller blockers (gets engulfed by linemen, though)...Has enough quickness to cut off the outside running plays and while he might sometimes get over-extended, he has the balance and body control to recover...When he is able to avoid blockers on the move, he shows awareness to avoid and proper angles taken to shorten the field...Not really strong, but is an explosive hitter who brings his arms and feet to fit and secure...Needs to improve his overall strength to drop ballcarriers on contact, but is an efficient wrap-up tackler...Has the balance and foot agility to drop and get depth, doing a nice job of looking up and jumping the receivers...Has enough hip swerve to flip them and turn on the ball...Has the range to make plays coming off the edge, but on the inside blitz he will get hung up in traffic...Not a rush end, but gives good chase coming from the backside...Has the body control and concept for taking pursuit angles to make plays at the opposite sideline...Has good eyes in pass coverage and it is rare to see him bite on play action...Smooth in his backpedal and comes out of his breaks with no wasted motions...Makes quick reads and is good at locating and neutralizing the cutback lanes.\r"

                "Overview": "A versatile linebacker, Hayes has experience at both inside and outside positions, even though he started strictly on the weak -side during his time with the Seminoles. As a junior, he helped lead an aggressive defensive front seven that saw FSU rank 22nd in the nation in rush defense (116.62 ypg) and eighth in tackles for losses (7.92 pg). Hayes' 17.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage ranked second in the Atlantic Coast Conference.\r\nAt Madison County High School, Hayes was rated the third-best linebacker in the country according to Tom Lemming of ESPN.com. He was a four-star player by Rivals.com, as that service also rated him the nation's third-best outside linebacker and the fifth-best overall prospect in the state of Florida. He added second-team-All USA Today All-American honors and was a first-team choice by Parade Magazine.\r\nHayes played in the Cali-Florida All-Star game, where he tackled a California player on the last play of the game to help lead the Florida team to victory, posting six tackles with three stops for losses in that contest. As a senior, he had 124 tackles with 27 for losses and 11 sacks. He posted 130 tackles, 20 stops behind the line of scrimmage, 19 sacks and three interceptions as a junior.\r\nHayes chose Florida State over scholarship offers from Tennessee and Clemson, appearing in 12 games as a reserve outside linebacker in 2005. He saw action mostly behind Ernie Sims at strong-side linebacker and on special teams, where he recovered a blocked punt for a touchdown. He also made 17 tackles (13 solos), recovered a fumble and broke up one pass.\r\nIn 2006, Hayes took over weak-side outside linebacker chores, starting nine of 10 games he played in. He sat out the Boston College, Maryland and Virginia clashes after suffering a right knee medial collateral ligament sprain vs. Duke. He still managed to rank fourth in the Atlantic Coast Conference with 12 stops for losses, finishing fifth on the team with 59 tackles (31 solos), including three sacks. He also picked off a pass and deflected three others.\r\nAs a junior, Hayes garnered All-American honorable mention and All-ACC recognition. He was originally scheduled to take over middle linebacker chores, but started 12 times at his familiar weak-side linebacker slot. He ranked second on the squad with 80 tackles (49 solos), adding five sacks and ranking second in the league with 17.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He caused two fumbles, returned an interception for a touchdown and broke up three passes.\r\nHowever, his 2007 campaign was not without a little drama. Hayes was suspended for the first quarter of the Alabama game after he was arrested Sept. 21, along with fullback Joe Surratt, for an altercation with police outside a Tallahassee bar. Head coach Bobby Bowden also ordered Hayes to get behavioral counseling and perform community service besides other unspecified internal discipline. \r\nHayes issued an apology through Florida State to the school, fans, teammates, coaches and his family, \"I have always taken pride in representing myself and this university in a positive manner and unfortunately, I did not live up to those standards on this occasion,'' he said. \"I realize I cannot make another mistake of this or any other nature.'' \r\nMore than 30 Seminoles were suspended from playing in the 2007 Music City Bowl due to an athletic department-wide academic scandal. A university official confirmed after the game that Hayes was not enrolled in school, but still played in the contest. Shortly after the bowl's conclusion, Hayes announced he was bypassing his senior year and applying for the 2008 NFL Draft.\r\nHayes issued the following statement through the university's sports information department: \"I would like to announce my decision to leave Florida State University and enter the NFL Draft. This has been the toughest decision I have ever had to make. I would first like to thank Coach (Bobby) Bowden and (assistant) Coach (Chuck) Amato and the rest of the coaching staff for giving me all tools I needed to become a great football player. I would also like to thank my teammates, fellow FSU students and fans for supporting me and most of all, my family for always showing me love, guidance and support.\"\r\nIn 35 games at Florida State, Hayes started 21 contests. He collected 156 tackles (93 solos) with eight sacks for minus-42 yards, 29.5 stops for losses of 113 yards and two quarterback pressures. He caused two fumbles, recovered another and deflected seven passes. He scored on a blocked punt that he recovered in the end zone and also on a 38-yard interception return."

                "Overview": "Every year, there are a few Cinderella stories that capture not only the attention of the media and fans, but also professional scouts. This year, many of those talent evaluators feel the glass slipper perfectly fits Howard, a cat-quick, undersized college defensive end. With his blazing speed and lack of bulk, he will probably shift to linebacker at the next level. \r\nMany hope Howard have the same success in converting to that position as Dallas' trio of DeMarcus Ware, Greg Ellis and Anthony Spencer, New England's Mike Vrabel and Pittsburgh's Clark Haggans, all former college down linemen who have had great success moving to the linebacker unit. After patiently biding his time at Georgia, playing behind Charles Johnson and Quentin Moses his first three years, Howard is more than up to the task at handling whatever challenge that lies ahead in 2008.\r\nAt Hanahan High School, Howard was a three-time All-Region and two-time Class AA All-State selection as a running back and linebacker. He was named Class AA All-State by the Associated Press and the South Carolina Pigskin Prep, adding Class AA Defensive Player of the Year honors as a senior. BorderWars.com rated him the seventh-best player in the state of South Carolina. He was chosen the South Defensive MVP in the North-South All-Star game and earned Region 6-AA Player of the Year honors.\r\nHoward was selected the Post and Courier (Charleston) Most Valuable Defensive Back, All-Low Country and Palmetto Touchdown Club Defensive Back of the Year. He recorded 89 tackles, nine stops for losses, three interceptions and returned a fumble for a touchdown as a senior. He also gained 952 yards rushing with 17 touchdowns that year. \r\nHoward was also a member of the basketball and track squads. He placed third in the 100- and 200-meter dashes at the 2002 AA State meet. At the Region 6-AA championships, he went on to win both events.\r\nIn 2003, the 210-pound Howard enrolled at Georgia, spending the season performing on the scout team. He appeared in 11 games as a reserve strong-side outside linebacker in 2004, coming up with just three tackles (2 solos). He shifted to strong-side defensive end in 2005, playing in 13 games behind Will Thompson. He posted 24 tackles (16 solos) with 1.5 sacks and pressured the quarterback six times.\r\nHoward again shifted positions as a junior, moving to weak-side defensive end, playing in 13 games behind Moses. He managed to record 11 tackles (10 solos) with four pressures, as he also caused and recovered a fumble. \r\nAs a senior, Howard garnered All-Southeastern Conference honors. Finally given a starting opportunity, the weak-side end registered 42 quarterback pressures, as he ranked second in the league and led the team with 10.5 sacks. His 12 stops behind the line of scrimmage tied for the team lead, adding 41 tackles (32 solos). He caused three fumbles and recovered two others, returning one for a touchdown. He also broke up three passes.\r\nIn 50 games at Georgia, Howard started 13 contests. He closed out his career with 79 tackles (60 solos), 12 sacks for minus-116 yards and 13.5 stops for losses of 121 yards. He added 52 quarterback pressures with four forced fumbles and also had three fumble recoveries, returning two for a total of 23 yards and a touchdown. He also deflected three passes."

He will make a sensational catch one second and drop an easy throw the next. If he continues to mature and learns how to run routes better, he could be a decent slot receiver. But without blazing speed or a sudden burst, combined with stiff hips, he is going to be limited more to just working on controlled routes rather than stretching the field.",

When injuries took away two of the Wildcats' top offensive weapons in tailback Rafael Little and receiver Keenan Burton for long stretches of the 2007 season, Johnson was more than ready to fill that void.\r\nStarting 10 of 13 games while seeing action at split end, flanker and in the slot, Johnson became just the fourth player in school history to gain more than 1,000 yards receiving in a season. His 13 touchdown catches were one shy of the school single-season record. \r\nHe also produced game-winning scoring grabs in three of the school's most memorable comebacks, snatching a 57-yarder with 0:28 left in a 40-34 victory over Louisville; catching a 7-yarder in triple overtime to give UK a 43-37 win over LSU and closing out his career with a 38-yard fourth-quarter grab in a 35-28 triumph over Florida State in the Music City Bowl.\r\nAttending Rodriguez High School, Johnson only played two years of football, as the school did not add a football program until his junior year. He started at running back as a junior and quarterback as a senior, in addition to playing safety, linebacker and end on defense. He earned All-State and first-team All-Conference honors and was named Most Valuable Player of the East-West Shrine All-Star Game following his senior season. He also played two years of basketball and was second-team All-Conference. \r\nJohnson enrolled at Chabot College in 2004, where he started every game during his two-year career. As a freshman, he caught 32 passes for 607 yards (19.0 avg) and six touchdowns, earning second-team All-Golden Gate Conference honors, as he helped lead Chabot to the league championship.\r\nIn 2005, Johnson caught 73 passes for 1,060 yards (14.5 avg) and 12 touchdowns, as he ranked fourth in receptions and receiving yards per game among California's 72 junior colleges. He earned first-team All-Region honors and was named California Player of the Week vs. Merced College.\r\n\"Steve is a tremendous athlete and a hard worker,\" Chabot head coach Dan Calcagno said. \"He's the kind of person who has a goal, gets his mind set on it, and does it.\" \r\nHe would finish his Chabot College career with 1,667 yards and 18 touchdowns on 105 receptions (15.88 avg).\r\nJohnson turned down scholarship offers from Marshall, Wyoming and Washington State to enroll at Kentucky in 2005. It was a tough time for him to adjust to major college life, putting him in the coach's doghouse for his work ethic. He managed to catch only 12 passes for 159 yards (13.2 avg) and one touchdown in 13 games of limited action as a junior.\r\nWith his improved work ethic, Johnson earned 10 starting assignments in 2007, earning All-Southeastern Conference first-team honors, in addition to being named the team's Most Improve Player by the coaching staff. He ranked second in the league with an average of 80.8 yards per game receiving. He snatched 60 passes for 1,041 yards (17.4 avg) and 13 touchdowns.\r\nIn 26 games at Kentucky, Johnson started 10 times. He hauled in 72 passes for 1,200 yards (16.67 avg). Fourteen of those catches resulted in touchdowns. He also recorded one solo tackle."

                "Overview": "Trevor Laws found a home at left defensive end during his senior year in the Fighting Irish 3-4 defensive alignment after spending his first three seasons manning the left defensive tackle position in a conventional 4-3 set. \r\nHe proved to be a disruptive bull rusher who compensated for a lack of size with a relentless motor and excellent lateral agility.\r\nMany Irish faithful compare Laws to a former Notre Dame great, Chris Zorich, a two-time All-American (1989-90) who was named United Press International Lineman of Year for 1989 and was chosen CBS Sports/Chevrolet Defensive Player of the Year for 1990, in addition to being the 1990 Lombardi Award recipient. Law has also excelled on special teams, finishing his career by blocking six kicks over the course of his final three seasons.\r\nAt Apple Valley High School, Laws earned USA Today and ESPN first-team All-American honors as a defensive lineman. He was rated the top prospect in the state of Minnesota by Rivals.com and was generally rated the number-two defensive tackle in the nation. He added All-Midwest honors from the Detroit Free Press and was selected Gatorade Player of the Year in Minnesota. He was rated 41st on ESPN's list of the nation's top 100 players and named to the 10-member Super Prep team by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.\r\nThe Minnesota Lions Club Athlete of the Year and member of the Minnesota Vikings All-State team recorded 87 tackles (17 for loss) and 11 sacks as a senior in 2002. He also played offensive tackle and guard. He posted 85 tackles, 10 sacks and 25 stops for loss as a junior in 2001, continuing to play on both sides of the ball. He was chosen to play in the Minnesota All-State Bowl.\r\nLaws was also invited to play in U.S. Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio but declined because of a wrestling commitment. He finished 49-0 as a state champion super-heavyweight wrestler as a junior and was ranked as the No. 1 high school wrestler in the nation. He finished his wrestling career as a three-time All-American with a record of 142-5 and helped his wrestling team win the state title as a sophomore, junior and senior.\r\nLaws served as team captain in both football and wrestling as a senior. He was named an Academic All-State wrestler in 2002. In track and field, he had a top shot put mark of 58 feet. He was also a member of the National Honor Society and a peer mediator in high school.\r\nLaws committed to Notre Dame after his high school junior year, spurning scholarship offers from Iowa, Miami, Michigan, Ohio State, Stanford and Southern California. He sat out the 2003 campaign with the Irish and then played as a reserve defensive tackle in 12 games during the 2004 season. He went on to produce 17 tackles (eight solo), a sack and two stops for losses. He also broke up two passes, recovered a fumble and caused another.\r\nThe sophomore lineman took over left defensive tackle duties in 2005, sharing the West-wood One/State Farm Student-Athlete of the Year Award with offensive guard Dan Santucci thanks to his 3.15 grade-point average. He totaled 33 tackles (eight solo) with 1.5 sacks, three stops behind the line of scrimmage and a trio of quarterback pressures. He also blocked a pair of kicks.\r\nIn 2006, Laws played left defensive tackle and served on the team's leadership committee. He registered 62 tackles (22 solo), as he came up with 9.5 stops for losses, including 3.5 sacks. He added a pair of pressures while picking off a pass and batting away another. He also caused and recovered a fumble while blocking the third kick for his Irish career.\r\nAs a senior, Laws earned All-American third-team and Academic All-American second-team honors. He was named the Notre Dame Monogram Club Most Valuable Player and received the Notre Dame Club of St. Joseph Valley Rockne Student-Athlete Award. He shifted to left defensive end, leading the team with a career-high 112 tackles (53), as he was the only down lineman to rank among the nation's top 100-tackle producers in the major college ranks during 2007.\r\nLaws blocked a career-high three kicks and deflected five passes in his final season. He recovered two fumbles, registered a team-high four sacks with seven pressures and also paced the Irish with eight stops behind the line of scrimmage. \r\nLaws appeared in 49 games for the Irish, starting 25 contests at left defensive tackle and 12 at left end. He recorded the most tackles by a down lineman in the last 26 years, finishing with 224 hits (91 solo), 10 sacks for minus-76 yards, 22.5 stops for losses of 112 yards and 12 quarterback pressures. He caused two fumbles, recovered four others and had nine pass deflections with one interception. He also blocked six kicks."

                "Overview": "With many professional teams begging for speed at linebacker, Curtis Lofton entered the 2008 NFL Draft pool as junior knowing he has a chance to make a big splash. \r\nA strong-side linebacker for most of his career, Lofton is just starting to tap his vast potential and may have found his calling at middle linebacker. He shifted inside for his final four games with the Sooners and finished his junior campaign with one of the most productive seasons by a defender, as his 157 total tackles are the most by an Oklahoma player since George Cumby amassed 160 hits in 1979.\r\nAt Kingfisher High School, Lofton was a standout inside linebacker who also competed at fullback. He was rated the eight-best middle linebacker in the nation by ESPN.com and the second-best overall player in the Midlands region by Super Prep and Scout.com, who also had him listed as the state of Oklahoma's second-ranked player. Rivals.com rated Lofton the fourth-best inside linebacker and 62nd-best prospect in the prep ranks.\r\nA Parade first-team All-American as a senior, Lofton added Daily Oklahoman All-State and Oklahoma High School Coaches Association All-State first-team accolades. He lettered three times, leading the team in tackles with 168, adding eight sacks as a senior. In 2003, he collected 187 tackles and had 150 stops as a sophomore.\r\nFor his career, Lofton registered 505 tackles, leading the team to the Class 3A State Championship in 2003 and helped the squad advance to the semifinals in 2004, when he also rushed for 12 touchdowns. Nominated for the March of Dimes Oklahoma Headliners Banquet as one of the top scholar-athletes in the state of Oklahoma, he was a three-time Honor Roll student. He also competed for the basketball and track teams.\r\nLofton enrolled at Oklahoma in 2005, but was relegated mostly to special teams while seeing just a few snaps at middle linebacker. He had a two-yard kickoff return and had three solo tackles, including one behind the line of scrimmage.\r\nIn 2006, Lofton appeared in all 14 games, starting at strong-side linebacker in five games. He ranked ninth on the squad with 37 tackles (20 solo), including 4.5 stops for losses. He caused and recovered a fumble, adding a 14-yard kickoff return in the Fiesta Bowl vs. Boise State.\r\nLofton wrested a full-time starting job in 2007. He lined up at strong-side linebacker for the first 10 contests before shifting to the middle for the final five games. His career-high 157 tackles (94 solo) rank seventh on the school's single-season list and were the third-highest total in the NCAA ranks (his average of 11.21 tackles per game ranked seventh nationally). \r\nLofton also had a sack, 10.5 stops for losses and four forced fumbles. He recovered a fumble for a touchdown, scored once on three interceptions and deflected two passes. That performance earned him consensus All-American and All-Big Twelve Conference honors, in addition to being selected Big Twelve Defensive Player of the year by the Associated Press.\r\nAfter the season, Lofton declared that he was entering the 2008 NFL Draft.  Lofton said the atmosphere at Oklahoma readied him for the next step.\r\nIn 39 games at Oklahoma, Lofton started 19 times, including four starts at middle linebacker. He recorded 197 tackles (117 solo) with a two-yard sack and 16 stops for losses of 33 yards. He caused five fumbles and recovered two others, returning one 12 yards for a score. He gained 71 yards on three interceptions, returning one for a touchdown and batted down two other throws. He also gained 16 yards on a pair of onside kickoff returns."

                    "Compares To": "JUSTIN TUCK-New York Giants...Both defensive ends will make a nice living coming off the edge. They have impressive size, though Merling is best playing on the move to utilize a sudden initial step to slip past blocks. He is not a good stack-and-control type and must do a better job of protecting himself from low blocks, but he is quick to provide outside run contain and shows a quick swim-and-spin move that generally gets him into the backfield to pressure the pocket. He won't read and react in an instant, but has closing speed to seal the deal, even in long pursuit, once he locates the ball. He has to improve his lower-body strength, but there is enough athletic ability there to get by as his body continues to mature.",
                    "Negatives": "Needs to improve his hand play -- he sometimes struggles to disengage once blockers lock on -- and keep blockers off his feet...Best on the move when he sets his base, but he will turn his shoulders and get sealed off at the point of attack...Seems to recognize the ball quicker when he's on the move rather than working through a crowd inside...His lower-body frame lacks the power to take on bulky blockers with consistency, and he shows a decent anchor vs. tight ends and backs, but he can still be driven off the ball when offensive linemen go directly at him...Despite his quickness and urgency coming off the edge, he still needs to develop rush moves (club and rip are lacking, but his swim move is very effective), as he relies too much on quickness to separate...Gets caught up by double-team activity inside and must protect himself better because he doesn't have the raw power needed to split double teams...Plays with a good motor, but will get frustrated and shut down when the bigger blockers consistently neutralize him.\r",
                    "Positives": "Well-built with thick legs and long arms, tight waist and hips, and minimal body fat...High-energy player who is best on the move, showing better ability to make plays along the edge than working inside...Flashes good explosion off the ball and has decent anchor and leverage ability to hold ground vs. isolated blockers at the point of attack...Quick off the edge and shows good hustle to the ball, utilizing his upfield burst to give him an advantage over the large, slower blockers...Extends his arms well to keep blockers off him and has the swim move lateral agility to excel coming from the backside...Shows good breakdown and body control in his tackling form, using his long arms to capture ballcarriers in space...Reads hats well and reacts to the play effectively, showing the ball awareness instincts on the move to neutralize and redirect the outside running lanes...Shows good balance in his moves down the line, demonstrating the knee bend to keep his feet on the move...Easily defeats blocks with his speed, showing the ability to dip and turn the corner in a flash...Disengages quickly from his man to move toward the ball and plays until the whistle, showing an explosive closing burst...Has that extra surge to consistently finish off his blocks, taking good angles to pressure the pocket...Still needs to improve his overall strength, but he has enough raw power to deliver pop when making contact with the quarterback and when he keeps his pads down and uses his hands, he can control the fullback and clog the rushing lanes...Has a sudden short burst to penetrate and shows the sustained speed to be effective in long pursuit...Natural pass rusher who comes off the ball with a quick twitch, body lean and leverage, but is best when operating in plays away from him, so he can redirect and give backside chase...Has the arm strength to drag down the ballcarriers and the foot speed to close on the quarterbacks and collapse the pocket...Comes off the line at the proper pad level and can burst around the corner with speed, looping through the gaps with good urgency...Has improved his hand usage during his junior year, as he played off blocks much better to work his way down the line...Gives chase with good body control...While he has the leverage to hold up, with his speed, he is much more effective on the move, where he can combine his lateral quickness and motor to keep containment on the outside...Not an explosive tackle, but will hit, wrap and secure...Has the functional leg drive to bull rush at times, but his best trait is his ability to get upfield in a hurry.\r"

                "Overview": "A well-traveled prep standout, Phillip Merling returned home several years ago, enrolling at Clemson, where he spent the last three years being coached by his uncle, Chris Rumpf. \r\nRumpf was the Tigers' defensive line coach. Merling had great success playing for his uncle earlier in his football career, as both were together at Calhoun County High School, before Merling entered the collegiate ranks.\r\nMerling developed into one of the elite rush ends in the college ranks. That made it surprising when he opted to bypass his senior year to play in the National Football League in 2008, as the staff tried valiantly to convince him that another year of college would only enhance his draft stock.\r\nMerling began his prep career playing football for three seasons under head coach Chris Rumpf at Calhoun County High School in Saint Matthews, South Carolina. He earned Defensive MVP honors as a junior. He also excelled in basketball, receiving All-Conference, All-Region, and All-Area in hoops as a sophomore and junior. He averaged 20 points and 12 rebounds on the hardwood as a senior and averaged 15 points and 13 rebounds as a junior.\r\nFor his senior prep campaign, Merling transferred to Cordova High School in Memphis, Tennessee. The tight end/defensive end had 20 catches for 430 yards and four scores that season, adding 34 tackles and four sacks. He played in the Tennessee/Kentucky All-Star game, earning first-team All-State and All-Region accolades. He was also an All-Dixie team pick by Super Prep and an All-Atlantic Region choice by Prep Star.\r\nTo improve his academic standing, Merling enrolled at Fork Union Military Academy in 2004. He earned team MVP honors after catching 38 passes for 647 yards and five touch-downs, adding five sacks, 51 tackles, and eight pass break-ups. He was rated the 18th-best tight end in the nation according to Super Prep and No. 20 tight end by Scout.com. He was ranked as the No. 25 prep player in the nation by Rivals.com.\r\nMerling enrolled at Clemson in 2005, spurning scholarship offers from Arkansas, South Carolina, Kentucky and Memphis. He played behind All-American defensive end Gaines Adams, appearing in 271 plays over 12 games. He made 22 tackles (17 solo) with two sacks, four stops for losses and four quarterback pressures, earning Rivals.com Freshman All-American second-team honors.\r\nMerling moved into the starting lineup at left defensive end in 2006. He generated 20 QB pressures to go along with 46 tackles (31 solo) while taking 515 snaps for a team that ranked 13th in the nation in total defense (280.77 yards per game). He got to the quarterback on three sacks and tallied 10 stops for losses while causing a fumble and deflecting four passes.\r\nMerling earned All-Atlantic Coast Conference honorable mention in 2007, as he ranked tied for fifth in the league with 17 stops behind the line of scrimmage. He produced 78 tackles (51 solo) with 21 pressures and seven sacks while starting all 13 games. He caused two fumbles and recovered another, helping the Tigers rank ninth in the nation in total defense (306.77 yards per game) and 10th in scoring defense (18.69 points per game)."

He competed as an offensive guard and tackle, but underwent left knee arthroscopic surgery in mid-September that kept him away from practices until October.\r\nIn 2005, Rachal appeared in all 13 games as a reserve offensive guard. He saw most of his action on special teams with the field goal/placement units. He earned Sophomore All-American and All-Pac-10 Conference second-team honors in 2006, starting every game, except vs. Washington, at right offensive guard. He was part of a young line that paved the way for an offense that generated 391.8 yards and 30.5 points per game.\r\nAs a junior, Rachal picked up All-American and All-Pac-10 Conference first-team honors despite missing three games after he suffered right knee ligament damage in the Washington game. He posted 80 knockdowns when healthy, leading the way for an improved rushing attack that averaged 197.2 yards per game, compared to 128.0 yards the previous season.\r\nTalking about his son's decision to forgo his final season at Southern California, Charles Rachal said he thought family medical issues influenced his son's decision. \"I think it played a considerable role because he loves his mama,\" he said. Charles Rachal said he did not expect his son to change his mind. \"He's right around the corner from his degree,\" he said."

                "Overview": "It might sound funny to call 2007 the year that Pat Sims arrived for the Tigers, but after two wasted seasons earlier in his career and brief flashes of brilliance in 2006, he truly put it all together as a junior. He dominated in the trenches, which was a remarkable feat, considering he had to play most of the season wearing a club-like hard, protective cast over several broken fingers and bones in his left hand.\r\nA late bloomer, Sims was relegated to scout-team duties most of the 2004 season and then left the team prior to the 2005 season. The media reported that his departure was due to being demoted to third string during fall drills. But, he was simply not mentally able to play for the Tigers and needed time away from the university. His career was at a crossroads, but a family issue was the major reason for his departure, as he struggled throughout that summer dealing with the sudden death of his sister from a heart attack.\r\nSims was a standout defensive lineman at Dillard High School, earning Prep Star All-American honors as a senior. He was a Florida Class 5A All-State selection, rated among the top 20 defensive tackles in the nation by Rivals.com and garnered Southeast Elite 88 accolades from that recruiting service. He was also a member of the Florida Times Union Super 75, Mobile Register Super Southeast 120 and Orlando Sentinel Florida Top 100 teams.\r\nAs a senior, Sims registered 65 tackles, with 20 stops behind the line of scrimmage and 12 quarterback sacks. He also collected 75 tackles, 12 sacks and 22 stops for losses during his junior season. In addition to lettering in football, he competed with the school's basketball team, helping to lead them to a state championship as a junior. \r\nSims was regarded as the cream of Auburn's recruiting crop in 2004, as the defensive lineman turned down scholarship offers from Florida, Florida A&M, Mississippi, North Carolina State, Ohio State and Rutgers to join the Tigers' program. He was almost an academic casualty until he improved his ACT score prior to enrollment. He appeared in the season opener vs. Louisiana-Monroe, recording three solo tackles with a stop for a loss and a forced fumble, but did not play in any of the other contests.\r\nUpon returning to the team in 2006, he was used in all 13 games, playing behind Sen'Derrick Marks at right defensive tackle. He posted 16 tackles (nine solo) with three sacks and five stops behind the line of scrimmage. He also broke up one pass and caused a pair of fumbles.\r\nSims claimed the starting right tackle position in 2007 preseason camp, going on to earn first-team All-Southeastern Conference honors. He suffered broken fingers on his left hand early in the season and wore a cast the rest of the way, but still managed to rank second on the team with 4.5 sacks, 11.5 stops behind the line of scrimmage and 15 QB pressures. He also caused two fumbles, recovered one that he returned for a touchdown and deflected three passes.\r\nIn mid-December, the media began reporting that Sims would leave the school after the 2007 season to play in the National Football League. On Dec. 19, head coach Tom Tuberville confirmed no current Auburn underclassman has filled out paperwork to join the NFL draft. The coach stated that Sims would not be leaving the team. \r\nThree weeks later, Sims held a press conference and announced that he was leaving the school. \"This was something that I carefully thought about and felt it was in my best interest to pass on my senior season at Auburn and make myself eligible for the NFL Draft,\" Sims said. \"It's always been a dream of mine to play at the next level and I believe this is the right time to pursue that goal.\""

                    "Compares To": "JAKE SCOTT-Tennessee...Bell is a work in progress, but for a player with just two years on offense and 23 games of football experience for his entire life, he is well on his way to being a pet project for a patient offensive line coach. He is woefully weak, by NFL standards, and will need a year or two in the weight room, but you can see that the athletic ability is there. When evaluating Bell, it's important to realize that he has never been through more than 14 weeks of football-oriented strength training until now, due to his offseason involvement in basketball in 2005-06 and 2006-07. Considering his frame, attributes, work ethic and character, it is very easy to envision him adding strength and size as he begins a pro football career, refining and developing his football skills without the detriment of years of bad technique or poor habits to overcome.",
                    "Negatives": "Has minimal experience playing offensive tackle (two years), much less football (23 games)...His frame has yet to mature and even though he added 20 pounds of bulk in 2007 (to 303), he has very poor strength and will need at least a full season in the weight room to develop his body before he is capable of contributing...When he gets too tall in his stance, he struggles to create movement off the snap (has worked on keeping his pads down as a senior)...Still learning the game and is prone to making basic mistakes, but learns quickly and is a good study in film sessions...Has very active hands, but without strength, he does not shock or jolt with his punch...Must learn to stay lower in his stance, as bull rushers have good success walking him back when he gets too erect...Still has problems adjusting when trying to sustain and position...Lacks explosion off the snap (quick, but has little power behind his surge), preventing him from getting good leverage on drive blocks...Will be better served in a system that relies more on zone blocking, at least until he develops needed strength.",

                "Overview": "Initially a basketball scholarship athlete at Northwestern State, Bell had never played football, at any level, before August 2005. He never played offensive tackle until three weeks before the 2006 season opener at Kansas, followed immediately by a visit to Baylor. He was the Demons' offensive line MVP at Kansas, in the first of 22 consecutive starts at left tackle in his final two seasons with Northwestern State. \nDuring the 2006 and 2007 seasons, in addition to a rigorous Football Championship Subdivision schedule, Bell and the Demons played Kansas, Baylor, Mississippi (both seasons) and Texas Tech, giving him a chance to compete against college football's highest level. \nMeanwhile, he was one of only four Division I athletes to play basketball and football in 2007. He signed a basketball scholarship and played his first three seasons in basketball for the Demons, playing in 88 games, starting six contests, for a highly-successful mid-major program that beat Iowa in the 2006 NCAA Tournament and played for the 2007 Southland Conference championship, missing on a return to the NCAA Tournament by four points.\nBell was an All-State and honorable mention All-American basketball standout at tiny Summerfield High School, which did not field a football team. He had always entertained the dream of playing football in high school, but would have had to transfer to a larger school a few miles away and leave behind his classmates (senior class of 13) and lifelong friends to do so.\nAfter graduation, Bell, whose half-sister is Cheryl Ford, a star forward with the Detroit Shock in the WNBA, found out his father was former National Basketball Association All-Star forward Karl Malone. He had no contact with Malone until he was 18.\nIn 2005, Bell was working out in the weight room following the Southland Conference Championship basketball season. He began to consider trying out for football, and asked for and got head basketball coach Mike McConathy's blessing and football coach Scott Stoker's approval. After reporting for preseason drills in August, he began playing defensive end (wore jersey No. 68) and was targeted for a red-shirt season before a spate of injuries forced him to start vs. eventual SLC champion Nicholls State.\nIn his first-ever football game, against an option offense, Bell made 11 tackles with a stop behind the line of scrimmage,in his only action of the season. Stoker tried not to play him because Bell's scholarship automatically transferred over to football if he saw action, but injuries forced his hand.\nIn 2006, Bell emerged as the leader of the offensive unit quickly after he became an instant starter three weeks before the season opener at Kansas when the coaching staff moved him across the ball from defensive end to offensive tackle due to injuries to other players.\nBucking the odds, he had the highest grade among the offensive linemen at Kansas and played admirably all year, learning all the while on the fly. After the football season, Bell resumed his basketball career, becoming a key inside force down the stretch to help the Demons win the Southland Conference East Division championship.\nAfter raising his draft status with an outstanding 2007 football season, Bell reluctantly ended his basketball career over the winter, giving up the senior year he had dreamed about to go through his first-ever extended strength training program and prepare for the NFL. \nIn 2007, Bell became the 39th All-American football player in school history - and the most unlikely of that group - as well as the eighth player to earn that honor in Scott Stoker's six seasons as head coach. He registered 50 knockdown blocks and graded over 80 percent for blocking consistency, helping the offense generate 3,996 yards, an average of 363.3 yards per game.\nNSU offensive line coach Jeremy Offutt, a former All-Big 12 standout at Oklahoma State, says Bell has a good \"nasty streak\" that serves him well in the trenches, but he is also typically a peacemaker in on-field altercations and maintains a good rapport with officials and his opponents."

He appeared in 13 games as a reserve tight end in 2004, catching three passes for 64 yards (21.3-yard average) and one touchdown. He participated on 157 offensive snaps and 150 more on special teams.\r\nBrown was listed second on the depth chart at tight end during fall drills, but prior to the season opener, he moved to right offensive tackle, starting all thirteen games. In 673 offensive snaps, he collected fifteen knockdown blocks. He also appeared in 148 special team plays.\r\nAs a junior, Brown continued to excel at right tackle. He registered 22 knockdowns in a total of 806 snaps. He also performed on special teams, recording two tackles while blocking a field goal. He earned second-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference recognition and was voted state Offensive Lineman/End of the Year by the Richmond Touchdown Club.\r\nIn 2007, Brown garnered second-team All-ACC honors. He switched to left offensive tackle, totaling 34 knockdowns, but he also allowed 8.5 of the 54 sacks given up by the front wall. He blocked a pair of kicks and registered four tackles.

But most of the attention he received was unwanted after he suffered through the worst campaign of his collegiate career. \r\nPrior to the season opener, Dunlap was arrested on a misdemeanor warrant after he neglected to pay a speeding ticket. He began the season out of shape and then gave up 4.5 quarterback sacks and six pressures in the first three games. \r\nInconsistency was followed by injury, as he left the Mississippi State clash after only 13 plays with a left elbow injury that would sideline him for the next two contests and keep him in reserve for two more games. Prior to leaving the MSU clash, he had allowed a sack and three pressures.\r\nUpon his return to the starting lineup, he had his best performance for the year vs. LSU, but after giving up four more pressures in two contests, he was yanked from the Tennessee Tech clash and spent the rest of the season as a reserve.\r\nDunlap was a two-way lineman at Brentwood Academy, where he helped lead the team to a 9-3 record and a berth in the Division II, Class 3A championship game as a senior. He was the recipient of the Tennessee Mr. Football Lineman of the Year Award for Division II-AAA and selected to The Tennessean All-Mid-state team. \r\nA Tennessee Sports Writers first-team Division II All-State selection, he was named to the Associated Press All-State first-team for all divisions and was also a Knoxville News Sentinel \"Tennessee Top 25\" pick. He averaged eight pancake blocks a game and allowed only one sack as a senior. On defense, he recorded 51 solo tackles, five sacks and 10 broken up passes. He also played basketball and averaged 15 points, eight rebounds and two blocks a game as a junior.\r\nDunlap redshirted in 2003 at Auburn and spent the 2004 season playing mostly on the field goal and PAT unit. A left hamstring pull during 2005 fall camp kept the tackle from earning a starting job, but he did manage to start one game (vs. Ball State).\r\nAs a junior, Dunlap took over left tackle duties, helping the offense average 320.9 yards per game. He totaled 70 knockdowns with seven touchdown-resulting blocks, finishing the season with an 84.9% grade for blocking consistency, as he allowed four of the team's 35 sacks on 282 pass plays.\r\nIn 2007, Dunlap was a preseason All-American and All-Southeastern Conference choice. He ended up starting six of 10 games in which he played, grading 75.8% for blocking consistency, as he saw his knockdown totals reduced to 33. He allowed 10 pressures and 4.5 sacks while participating in 402 plays."

He is best blocking at the line or in the short area, as he loses his feet when having to get into the second level.

His back-to-back concussions at the end of the regular season also might bring up a few medical red flags in a team's war room.",

Left shoulder could be a medical concern...Shows only adequate agility, balance, change-of-direction and body control...Struggled academically and needs more than several reps to retain plays...Might not be able to comprehend a complicated playbook...More of a stationary type of blocker who fails to generate much movement coming off the snap...Sustains blocks best while on the line, as he is adequate on pulls and traps, but is inconsistent with respect to landing blocks in space...Shows aggressiveness and takes good angles downfield, but doesn't adjust on the move very well...Though not a waist-bender, he over-extends too often and can be easily brought to the ground by strong rip-and-club moves...Shows quick, active feet, but lacks balance at times and doesn't adjust very well while on the move because of his narrow base...Does not have the strong anchor to hold ground vs. the bull rush and looks sluggish in his slide when trying to adjust to moving targets on the edge.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has a big, thick frame, not really muscled-up in the midsection, but there is not much softness in the stomach area...His arms are shorter than ideal, but when he uses them with consistency, he has strong hands to lock on to a defender and ride the opponent off the snap...Has good muscles in the shoulder and chest area, with good hip thickness and stout legs...Flashes good foot quickness and flexibility for the short pulls and traps...Shows alertness and awareness vs. stunts...Tough, aggressive, competitive guy with a finisher's attitude...Played through the 2006 season with a torn labrum, yet refused to take time off to heal, opting for surgery after the year...Has fit in well with the major college environment and coaches praise his work ethic...Type of player who will always play with aggression and is quick to make contact coming out of his stance, showing a mauler's mentality getting after his opponent...Consistently sets up quickly in pass protection, showing a good base and flexibility...Attacks defenders in good position, snapping his hips and flashing a punch...Locks on to his opponent, runs his feet and plays with a  finisher's attitude...As a run blocker, he consistently rolls his hips and drives his legs...Flashes a line surge to get movement...Flashes pop on contact on short traps...Extends to separate and has a good anchor in pass protection...Uses his hands to control and keep defenders off his body...Flashes a strong, solid punch to jolt his opponent...Can surprise a lethargic defender with his initial thrust off the snap, but needs to stay lower in his pads to generate good movement...Comes out of his stance fluidly to get out on the edge on sweeps.\r"

                "Overview": "After two years of dominating on the offensive line for the Bears, Gibson spent his last game in a California uniform on the sidelines due to an injury. Concussions suffered in the team's final two regular-season games vs. Washington and Stanford would prevent the left tackle from playing vs. Air Force in the Armed Forces Bowl.\r\nGibson's versatility proved to be just what the doctor ordered when injuries depleted the Cal front line during his first season with the Bears in 2006. He took over right tackle duties after the third game before moving to left tackle as a senior. He will more likely move to another position in the National Football League, as his stellar performances in the East-West Shrine Game practices at right guard have many scouts impressed enough to label that as his future residence.\r\nAt Napa High School, Gibson earned All-League, All-Metro and second-team All-State honors as a senior. He helped the team win a pair of conference titles during his playing days and was named the league's Lineman of the Year as a senior. He was also a participant in the East-West Shrine Game.\r\nAfter graduation, Gibson enrolled at Solano Community College. He earned All-League honors twice at offensive tackle and was named first-team All-American in 2005. He was listed as the eighth-best offensive line prospect in the junior college ranks by Super Prep and the 55th-best player in the country regardless of position by that service. JC Gridwire listed him as the 14th-best two-year player in the country and the fifth-best prospect in California. He also ranked as the 14th-best junior college player in the country by Rivals.com. \r\nGibson arrived at California, Berkeley and was immediately named the backup to Scott Smith at right tackle. When Smith was injured, Gibson stepped in and started the last 10 contests. The offensive line clicked right away, as its new right tackle helped that unit give up only 13 sacks on 413 pass plays.\r\nAs a senior, Gibson earned All-Pac 10 Conference honorable mention. Shifting to left tackle, he produced 47 knockdowns and eight touchdown-resulting blocks. The team averaged 407.5 yards per game with five new starters in the offensive lineup. Gibson and his fellow blockers gave up only 11 sacks on 443 pass plays."

                    "Compares To": "MATT JONES-Jacksonville...Jones is much faster than his former teammate, but both have one major issue with the way they play the game -- a lack of urgency in their route running. With their size, you would expect them to consistently win battles for the ball, but Monk is known to shy away from contact, allowing the defender to make plays on the ball. He has the frame to extend and catch outside the frame, but will revert to catching with his body in close quarters, resulting in quite a few balls not getting caught. He does not have blazing speed, but with his high-cut, long-legged frame, you would expect him to shield the ball better over the middle. Right now, he is strictly a vertical route runner, but unless he shows better fire in his belly, he could slide to the end of the draft, especially if you consider that he looked like a shell of his former self, returning to the field after back-to-back knee surgeries in 2007.",
                    "Negatives": "Needs to play with better urgency, as he does not explode into his routes and while he does a decent job of using his adequate speed to break away from second-level defenders after the catch, he possesses only marginal quickness and elusiveness to make tacklers miss...Struggles to find holes in the zone and must be more crisp in his route progression, as he will drift into coverage...Will take some plays off, especially when not involved in the action and isn't a blocker...Must play with better courage and aggressiveness, as he shies away from contact and hesitates when going up for the ball in a crowd (must be more determined combating for jump balls and use his height and reach to his own advantage)...Not explosive in his initial burst off the snap, as he will take a false step or two when releasing from the line, lacking urgency to get upfield...His tall frame and lack of strength allow defenders to get under his pads, as he does not come off the snap with a low center of gravity...Lacks the initial quickness and agility needed to get defenders off-balance when releasing from the line of scrimmage...Shows the ability to sink his hips coming out of his breaks, but just seems to go through the motions with a rolling start to get into his routes...More of a straight-line runner who is more comfortable running vertical routes, rather than have to battle the crowd to get to the short-to-medium area tosses...Even with his imposing frame, he lacks physicality vs. the press and shows only passive resistance when defensive backs attempt to reroute him...Must be more alert to pocket pressure, as he either lacks vision or desire to work back to the pocket when the quarterback is flushed out...Needs to use his frame better in attempts to shield defenders from the ball and must be more aggressive, as he lets defenders get in front of him to make plays...Better downfield blocker than at the line, as he looks totally disinterested when asked to face up to bigger defenders at the point of attack.\r",

                "Overview": "The 2007 season was supposed to be the year Marcus Monk etched a permanent mark in the Arkansas record books. \r\nAfter three stellar seasons, the split end looked sensational throughout spring practices and was primed for a banner senior season. But Monk suffered a right knee injury during an August scrimmage and never really got back on track. \r\nThe injury required two surgeries to repair, limiting him to just seven games, but everyone saw in those contests that he was not ready to play football, especially after he suffered a bruised calf upon his return to the playing field. He ranks third in school history with 138 receptions and 2,151 yards receiving, as his 27 touchdown grabs set the UA all-time record.\r\nAn intelligent athlete, Monk garnered athletic and academic honors during his days at East Poinsett County High School. An All-State selection in both football and basketball, he was the valedictorian of his class and was considered by some publications as the top basketball prospect in the state. He was named the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette's Athlete of the Year for his senior season on the gridiron and The Morning News ranked him as the fifth-best football prospect in Arkansas. \r\nMonk was rated as the 68th-best wide receiver in the nation by Rivals.com and also ranked as the state's No. 7 prospect by that scouting service. He had 72 receptions for 1,074 yards and 12 touchdowns as a senior and hauled in 52 catches for 1,104 yards and 19 scores as a junior. He also rushed for 110 yards on 10 carries and earned 400 yards on 15 kickoff returns. \r\nIn his senior season for the basketball team, Monk averaged 20.8 points, 16.4 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 3.8 blocks and 2.5 steals. He was named the Arkansas Democrat Gazette's Mr. Basketball, as he led his team to the Class AAA state championships, earning Most Valuable Player of the tournament. As a junior, he averaged 25.8 points and 15.7 rebounds per game. He averaged a double-double per game in his sophomore season and was part of a state basketball championship as a freshman and a senior. A member of the National Honor Society, the Math and Science clubs, and the student council, he graduated first in his class. \r\nMonk enrolled at Arkansas in 2004, starting six of 11 games at split end. He set the school freshman record with 37 receptions for 569 yards (15.4-yard average) and six touchdowns. Only South Carolina's Troy Williamson had more scoring catches (seven) among Southeastern Conference receivers that season. After the football season, he suited up with Arkansas' basketball team for 10 games, averaging 1.8 rebounds and one point per game.\r\nIn 2005, Monk started all 11 games at split end. He finished second on the squad with 35 catches for 476 yards (13.6-yard average) and seven touchdowns, scoring 42 points. He also had a solo tackle. He lined up at split end for all 14 contests in 2006, leading the team with 50 receptions, as his 962 yards (19.2 avg) ranked third on the school list and his 11 touchdown grabs set a new Razorback record.\r\nAfter his junior campaign, Monk gave serious consideration to leaving school early to enter the 2007 NFL Draft. He decided to remain with the Razorbacks for his senior season, telling The Morning News newspaper in northwest Arkansas that it was a difficult decision to forego the draft, particularly because he was projected as going as high as the second round. \"It's tough. You want to provide, especially in my situation. I want to provide for my family,\" Monk said. \"Sometimes, it's better to be patient.\" \r\nMonk was limited by knee and calf injuries in practices all year and seriously considered a medical hardship. He finished with just 144 yards on 16 catches (9.0-yard average) and saw his string of consecutive games with at least one catch come to an end when he stepped on the field for one play vs. Auburn (ending his string at 36 games). Three of his 16 catches were touchdowns.\r\nIn 43 games at Arkansas, Monk started 36 contests. He ranks third in school history with 138 receptions for 2,151 yards (15.6-yard average) and set the school record with 27 touchdown grabs, tied for seventh on the Southeastern Conference's all-time list. He also registered six tackles and had at least one reception in 42 of the 43 games he played."

                "Overview": "Josh Morgan was an enigmatic performer at Virginia Tech, showing flashes of brilliance with some sensational catches, only to frustrate a moment later by dropping an easy throw. Blessed with the size, speed and strength to be a go-to target for any pro team, only character and work ethic stand in the way of him realizing his vast potential.\r\nA two-year starter, Morgan accounted for 79 of his 122 career catches over the past two seasons. He has also shown the ability to fill in capably on special teams as a punt and kickoff returner. His exceptional leaping ability also proved to be an asset for that unit, as he blocked two kicks during his junior campaign.\r\nMorgan competed as a quarterback, wide receiver and cornerback at H.D. Woodson High School, where he earned All-DCIAA honors as a senior. He made eight catches for 275 yards and three touchdowns in a game vs. Glen Mills High, as he also contributed four sacks and blocked a punt. In his junior year, he passed for 987 yards and five touchdowns rushed for 898, including eight scores. He also excelled in basketball, earning MVP honors in two tournaments while playing for the hoops team. \r\nDue to academics, Morgan spent the 2003 season at Fork Union Military Academy. He caught 33 passes for 845 yards and eight touchdowns on offense and blocked four punts while also returning a punt for a touchdown. He enrolled at Virginia Tech in January 2004, going through the team's winter conditioning program, but was sidelined in May after undergoing surgery to repair a left foot fracture.\r\nMorgan played in 12 games at Tech in 2004, starting vs. Miami. He finished with 15 catches for 346 yards (23.1-yard average) and three touchdowns. In 2005, he started once vs. North Carolina at slot receiver, appearing in 13 games. He grabbed 28 passes for 471 yards (16.8-yard average) and four touchdowns, as he also performed on special teams. The sophomore totaled 105 yards on nine punt returns (11.7 avg) and 67 yards on four kickoff returns (16.8 avg) while collecting a pair of solo tackles.\r\nMorgan and defensive end Chris Ellis was arrested on Sept. 24, 2006. Morgan was charged with disorderly conduct and obstructing justice and Ellis was charged with obstructing justice, all misdemeanors. Police responded to a disturbance call along Blacksburg's Draper Road, a stretch of bars and restaurants, about 1:50 a.m. on a Sunday after getting a report that a large crowd had gathered and a fight may have been about to start.\r\nAn officer saw Morgan run into the road and punch at the glass on the driver's side door of a passing truck, according to a police report. He then opened the truck's door as if he was going to assault the driver, police said. Police told Morgan he was under arrest. Morgan, however, began to back up into the crowd and refused to submit to the arrest. Police were forced to use a single burst of pepper spray to subdue Morgan and then took him into custody. Head coach Fran Beamer then suspended both players for the following game vs. Georgia Tech, citing a violation of team policy.\r\nIn 12 games at split end, Morgan snared 33 passes for 448 yards (13.6-yard average) and four touchdowns.

                "Overview": "The son of former Atlanta Braves baseball star, Dale Murphy, Shawn Murphy has quietly made a name for himself. \r\nHe found a home at offensive guard for the Aggies in 2007, receiving one of the top blocking-consistency grades of any player at his position in the collegiate ranks. Even more impressive was the fact that his senior season was just his second year playing on the offensive line. \r\nAt Lone Peak High School, Murphy was a second-team All-State and All-Region selection as a defensive end. He lettered three times on the gridiron, twice leading his team in quarterback sacks. Following his bloodlines, he also competed on the baseball team.\r\nMurphy's college career began in 2001, when he played defensive end at Ricks College, starting three of 12 contests. He did not attend school from 2002-04, spending two of those years serving on a church mission to Brazil. He returned to the United States and the gridiron in 2005, lettering at Dixie State Community College. He converted to the offensive line, as one tackle that was part of an unit that averaged 345.8 yards per game, as the front wall allowed 31 quarterback sacks en route to a Rotary Bowl invitation.\r\nMurphy transferred to Utah State in 2006. He played in all 12 games as a left offensive tackle for the Aggies. It was a learning experience for the youngster, as the team struggled to a 1-11 record. The offense managed just 254.4 yards per game, but the front wall began to jell, as that unit allowed just 19 quarterback sacks on 298 pass plays.\r\nAs a senior, Murphy received All-American honorable mention and All-Western Athletic Conference second-team recognition. He again shifted positions, this time moving to left offensive guard. Even though the offense managed 277.9 yards per game and the line gave up 30 sacks and 12 pressures, Murphy graded 84.3 percent for blocking consistency, as he totaled 137 knockdowns and saw just one sack come over his area.\r\nAfter the season, Murphy was invited to play in the East-West Shrine Game, becoming the first USU offensive lineman to play in that game since center Tim Ruiz in 1986. \"It's a great honor and I'm excited to be given the chance to play with guys from around the country,\" Murphy said. \"I'm excited about the chance to show that I can play with those guys and hang with them.\" \r\n\"I had no idea no other Utah State lineman has been selected in that long of time, it's pretty amazing given all the great lineman that have come through Utah State,\" Murphy said in reference to being the first Aggie lineman since Ruiz. \"It's a great testament to (offensive lineman) Coach (Vance) Vice. Considering I came in as a defensive lineman and I was pretty rough around the edges, Coach Vice did a tremendous job of molding and shaping me into the offensive lineman I am now. I watch game film from last year even and it's embarrassing how rough I was.\" \r\n\"We're very proud of what Shawn's accomplished in a short time,\" head coach Brent Guy said. \"I think the thing that really attributes to his ability is that he played tackle his first year for us and then we moved him to guard this year. Obviously he has shown a lot of potential there because of the type of recognition he's getting and especially from the attention from the scouts.\""

A 35-game starter at right tackle, much of the team's success running the ball has come over his side of the field. A naturally strong mountain of a man, he boasts the team's best squat at 505 pounds.\nThe offense relied mostly on its passing attack before Schwartz was inserted into the starting lineup three years ago. The reason was a lack of quality blocking up front.

Fully recovered, he simply blew defenders off the line, as the Ducks led the Pac-10 Conference and ranked sixth in the nation with an average of 251.69 yards per game on the ground.\nAt Palisades Charter High School, Schwartz was rated among the top 75 prep prospects in the state by Super Prep, as well as California's fifth-best offensive line recruit by Tom Lemming, earning first-team All-City and All-Westside honors by the L.A.

He took over right tackle duties as a sophomore, posting 54 knockdowns as the team generated 438.8 yards per game. The front wall gave up only 20 sacks on 482 pass plays that season.\nSchwartz' junior year was a trying one. He battled as gamely as he could with the back problems, but was eventually forced to sit out the Portland and Arizona contests. He still managed to deliver 63 knockdowns, protecting the pocket as the Ducks averaged 241.0 passing yards per game.\nFully recovered from back problems, Schwartz garnered All-Pac 10 Conference honors in 2007. He collected 97 knockdowns and did a stellar job of clearing rush lanes as the Ducks ranked 10th in the nation in total offense (467.54 ypg) and 12th in scoring (38.15 ppg)."

                "Overview": "It took five long years and lots of changes, both on and off the field, for Thomas to emerge as one of the top trap blockers in the East. Always blessed with impressive athletic ability and quickness, the former walk-on began his Connecticut career as a defensive lineman, moving to the offensive during his red-shirt season in 2004.\r\nOver the next two seasons, Thomas saw minimal playing time. He played mostly on special teams and at tight end as a junior, but then switched to offensive guard late in the year, as he also changed jerseys, from No. 99 to 55. He made a concerted effort to improve all areas of his game in 2007, wresting a starting job of right guard during his final campaign.\r\nAt Hill Regional Career Magnet High School, Thomas lettered three times in football, playing as a defensive lineman and a tight end. He recorded six sacks his junior year. The versatile athlete earned a total of 10 varsity letters, including three as a center in basketball and four more as a pitcher and first baseman in baseball. He was an All-Division baseball player and was also named the SEC's Player of the Week once as a senior in basketball. He was also a member of the National Honor Society.\r\nThomas arrived on Connecticut's campus as a walk-on in 2003, competing on the scout team as a defensive tackle before moving to guard the following season. He did not suit up in 2004, again performing on the scout team as a member of the offensive line. He served strictly as a wedge-buster on special teams in 2005, appearing in 11 contests, as he returned one kickoff for 2 yards vs. Louisville.\r\nAs a junior, Thomas continued to perform on special teams, in addition to seeing action as a tight end and offensive guard. He was arrested Oct. 22 and charged with misdemeanor assault and breach of peace after he was involved in a fight at a campus area fast food restaurant. He was suspended for the Rutgers and Pittsburgh games, but when he returned to action he took over left guard duties in the team's final two games vs. Cincinnati and Louisville.\r\nThomas again shifted positions, starting all 13 games at right guard in 2007. He earned All-Big East Conference first-team honors, despite being hampered a bit at midseason by a shoulder contusion. He registered 77 knockdowns and graded 82.8 percent for blocking consistency while producing eight touchdown-resulting blocks."

                    "Positives": "Has a thick lower body frame that gives him his strong anchor and base...Bit lean up top for an offensive lineman, but possesses excellent natural strength and hand punch (needs to shoot his hands with better consistency, though)...Moves well sliding down the line and could be a better fit at an interior line position, thanks to his body control and ability to get after defenders on traps and pulls...Shows quickness off the ball and adequate speed working in space...When he keeps his pads down, he is much more effective attaining proper knee bend and roll with his hips...Shows good hand/eye coordination with his hand punch and is quick to reset...Displays good instincts on the field, picking up blitzes and making the switch to the second level, taking good angles to neutralize linebackers on traps and pulls...Smart player who has no problems taking plays from the chalkboard to the playing field...Called by the staff the toughest player on the team, as well as one of its hardest workers...Shows a willingness to play hurt and pushes himself in practices and the training room...Has a quick first step off the snap and when he keeps his pads down, is very efficient at getting into the exposed area of the defender's body on the rise...Has the feet and effort to stay with blocks and put his opponent on the ground, showing good aggression attacking his opponent...Shows the feet, strength and effort to move his man off the snap and create rushing lanes, using his leg drive and keeping his shoulders square to widen the creases...Displays good body control and hand contact while on the move...Gets to the second level quickly and has the athletic ability to block in space...Can lock up and steer his man while in pass protection and will generally keeps his hands inside his frame tight, letting him punch with good power...Will struggle at times vs. the speedy edge rusher, but generally shows good balance working in-line in pass protection...Has a good concept for taking angles on the short-area pulls, keeping his head on a swivel to locate secondary targets...When he keeps his center of gravity low, he is capable of handling the bull rush (will get walked back into the pocket when his level gets too tall)...Does a good job of squaring his shoulders and occupying the defender firing off the snap.\r"

                "Overview": "The team's offensive line leader, where he anchored the front wall with 28 consecutive starts at right tackle, Zuttah provided the Scarlet Knights with a dominant force up front. He did not allow any sacks over his last two seasons, as the line ranked second in the nation in 2007 and led the NCAA ranks in 2006 for fewest sacks allowed.\r\nThe David Bender Trophy winner as the top offensive lineman on the team, Zuttah could possibly shift to an interior line position at the next level. With his explosion off the snap, solid hand technique and raw power, some scouts feel that he could be much more efficient as a trap blocker rather than isolated at tackle.\r\nZuttah was a three-year starter at J.P. Stevens High School, where he was ranked as the 20th-best offensive lineman and defensive tackle in the country by The Insiders.com. He ranked as the nation's 34th-best offensive guard nationally and the 14th-best prospect in New Jersey by Rivals.com. Super Prep ranked him the ninth-best player in New Jersey after the two-time All-Area choice posted 45 tackles and 3.5 sacks at defensive end in 2003.\r\nZuttah also garnered first-team All-Middlesex and All-Group IV accolades as a senior. He led his team to a 24-8 record in his three years of varsity action, including winning the 2001 state championship with an undefeated season. He started at defensive tackle as a junior and defensive end as a senior. He also played guard and tackle on offense. In addition to football, he lettered in baseball and basketball.\r\nZuttah was thrust right into the action upon arriving at Rutgers in 2004. He missed the Pittsburgh and Temple clashes with a left knee sprain, but started five of nine contests, lining up vs. Navy at left tackle, vs. West Virginia and Boston College at left guard and vs. Vanderbilt at right tackle.\r\nA high left ankle sprain sidelined Zuttah for the Navy, South Florida and Louisville games in 2005. He started the other nine contests at left guard, helping an offense that averaged 397.08 yards per game.\r\nZuttah earned All-Big East Conference first-team honors in 2006. He registered 88 knock-downs, including 10 touchdown-resulting blocks while starting all season at right offensive tackle. He was part of the stingiest offensive line in college, as the Scarlet Knights allowed just eight sacks and the team ranked 15th in the NCAA in rushing, averaging 180.15 yards per game on the ground.\r\nAs a senior, Zuttah was again a first-team All-Big East Conference choice. He did not allow any sacks for the 28th consecutive game, posting a career-high 108 knockdowns as the offense averaged 449.31 yards per game."

                "Overview": "The team's quiet offensive leader, Boyd made noise pounding the ball up the middle of the line for the Gamecocks. He is a very physical inside runner who could provide an NFL backfield with the \"thunder\" it needs to gain tough inside yardage. He is proven to be one of the best pass-catching running backs in the college ranks. \r\nBoyd gained 2,267 yards rushing and 1,303 yards receiving during his time at South Carolina. He joined Stanley Pritchett (1,178 rushing and 1,097 receiving, 1992-95) as the only players in school history in the 1,000-1,000 club. On a struggling offense the last two years, Boyd was one of the team's few bright spots, producing 17 touchdowns on the ground and three more receiving since returning to the team from his one-year suspension in 2005.\r\nAt Orange High School, Boyd competed as a defensive back and running back for head coach Randy Daniel. He was rated the 12th-best overall prospect in the state of New Jersey by Rivals.com and the 21st-best defensive back in the country by Super Prep. He rushed for 1,535 yards and 20 touchdowns as a senior, adding 1,785 yards and 22 scores on the ground during his junior campaign. He also recorded eight interceptions his junior season while playing safety.\r\nBoyd earned South Carolina Freshman of the Year honors in 2003, playing tailback and on special teams as a true freshman in 2003. He ranked fourth on the squad with 232 yards and three touchdowns on 58 carries (4.0-yard average). He also snared 11 passes for 145 yards (13.2-yard average), including one score.\r\nAs a sophomore, Boyd split time between tailback and fullback. He finished second on the team with 309 yards on 62 rushes (5.0-yard average) and three touchdowns. He also placed second on the squad with 35 receptions for 347 yards (9.9-yard average) and a score. On special teams, he posted two solo tackles and fielded a short kickoff for a nine-yard return.\r\nAfter serving his season-long suspension in 2005, Boyd returned to the team with renewed vigor. He won a heated battle for the tailback position, going on to start all 24 contests he played in over the next two years. He led the team with 164 carries for 823 yards (5.0-yard average), scoring eight times on the ground in 2005. He ranked third on the team with 35 catches for 406 yards (11.6-yard avg) and a pair of scores. He also saw some action on special teams, as he returned four kickoffs for 64 yards (16.0-yard avg).\r\nQuarterback problems plagued the South Carolina offense in 2007, but Boyd again led the team with 180 rushes for 903 yards (5.0-yard average), as his nine touchdown runs rank tied for sixth on the school's single-season list. He finished second on the squad after hauling in a career-high 36 passes for 405 yards (11.2-yard average) and a score, as he amassed 1,308 all-purpose yards, an average of 109.0 yards per game.\r\nIn 46 games at South Carolina, Boyd started 27 contests. He collected 2,267 yards with 23 touchdowns on 464 carries (4.9-yard average). He grabbed 117 passes for 1,303 yards (11.1 avg) and five more scores.

                "Overview": "Jamaal Charles, a three-time All-Big Twelve Conference selection gave the Longhorns their 13th 1,000-yard rusher since the 1995 season during his junior season. \r\nHe is the only running back in UT history to post a run of at least 80 yards and a reception of at least 70 yards in the same game. During his three years at the university, he generated 102 rushing attempts that gained at least 10 yards, including 31 carries for over 20 yards and had 16 receptions for 10 yards or longer. \r\nCharles was also a standout for the Longhorns' track and field team. The four-time All-American clocked a personal-best 10.26 seconds in the 100-meter dash in winning the Big Twelve Conference title as a freshman. That season, he also ran the third leg of Texas' first-place 4x100m relay (39.19) at the NCAA Midwest Regional Championships to help Texas land an automatic berth into the NCAA Championships.\r\nAt Memorial High School, Charles was a two-time first-team Class 5A All-State tailback. He rushed for 4,107 yards and 50 touchdowns during his last two years. The Parade All-America selection played in the 2005 U.S. Army All-American Bowl and broke a Port Arthur career rushing record held by Joe Washington that stood for more than 30 years.\r\nCharles was an Associated Press All-State choice as a senior, adding Offensive MVP honors by the Houston Chronicle. He was named District 22-5A Player of the Year as a junior and senior, rushing for 2,056 yards on 260 carries and recorded 25 touchdowns as a senior. The tailback earned first-team All-State honors from the Texas Sports Writers Association and second-team All-State accolades from the Associated Press as a junior. \r\nHe received the Willie Ray Smith Award given to the Best High School Offensive Player in Southeast Texas in 2003, rushing for 2,051 yards and 25 touchdowns to help his team to the 5A Division II quarterfinals. Charles underwent shoulder surgery in 2003, but in his first game back, he posted 371 yards on 49 carries vs. Midland Lee High in 2004. He also had 400 yards on 31 carries and six scores vs. Spring Westfield and recorded 258 yards and four touchdowns in one half vs. Baytown Sterling that season. \r\nCharles also lettered in track, winning the Texas Class 5A state championships in the 110m hurdles (13.69) and 300m hurdles (36.03) as a senior. Both of his winning times led the nation. He was a member of the national record-setting 4x200m relay team as a sophomore and received a bronze medal in the 2003 World Youth Championships in the 400m hurdles.\r\nHeavily recruited, Charles enrolled at Texas in 2005, turning down scholarship offers from Texas A&M, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Miami, Nebraska and Notre Dame. Coming from an athletic family, he joined his brother, Shanderric Charles, who played running back at Southern Methodist (2001-02), his cousin, Graylin Johnson, who played safety at Texas (1989-90) and cousin, RaShonta LeBlanc, who plays basketball at Louisiana State (2004-present) as members of the family who have starred at the collegiate level. \r\nCharles started three of 13 contests for Texas in 2005. He earned Freshman all-American honorable mention and Freshman All--Big Twelve Conference honors from The Sporting News and was named the Big Twelve Offensive Freshman of the Year by the conference's coaches. He finished fifth on the UT freshman rushing chart with 878 yards on 119 carries (7.4-yard average), despite battling an ankle injury for three games. His 11 touchdowns on the ground rank second on the school's freshmen season-record list, as he also added 157 yards and a pair of scores on 14 receptions (11.2-yard average).\r\nBecause of track commitments, Charles did not get much practice time prior to the 2006 football season. He sat out vs. Sam Houston State with an ankle sprain and despite leading the team with 831 yards and seven touchdowns on 156 carries (5.3-yard average), fumble issues and a lack of strength made it a trying season. He also caught 18 passes for 183 yards (10.2-yard average) and a score.\r\nAs urged by the coaching staff, Charles spent the 2007 offseason in the training room, not on the Texas track team. The result was an additional 15 pounds of muscle on his once lanky frame. He asked the coaching staff to leave him in practice longer to help condition him for the rigors of a season. \r\nCharles went on to produce 1,619 yards on 258 carries (6.3-yard average), the fourth-best season total in school history. His 18 touchdown runs rank tied for fifth on the UT single-season list, as he also came up with 199 yards on 17 catches (11.7-yard average) to finish his junior year with 1,818 all-purpose yards. He ran for over 100 yards seven times during his 13 starts and, outside of missing the second half of the Texas Tech clash with a left ankle sprain, he was relatively healthy for the first time in his career.\r\nFor that performance, Charles was tabbed a Doak Walker Award (nation's top running back) semifinalist and earned unanimous first-team All-Big Twelve Conference honors. He was named UT's George \"Hook\" McCullough co-MVP, the Darrell K. Royal Most Valuable Offensive Player and the Clyde Littlefield Outstanding Offensive Back. He led the league and ranked 10th in the nation, averaging 124.54 yards per game rushing.\r\nIn 38 games at Texas, Charles started 17 contests. He rushed 533 times for 3,328 yards (6.2-yard average), the fourth-best career total in school history, as his 36 touchdowns on the ground rank tied for fifth in Longhorn annals. He gained 539 yards with three scores on 49 receptions (11.0-yard average) and recorded four tackles (three solo). He scored 234 points and ran for at least 100 yards 11 times, finishing with 3,867 all-purpose yards."

                "Overview": "Arkansas' duo of Felix Jones and Darren McFadden electrified Fayetteville for years. The junior tandem is taking the act to the NFL and not everyone is convinced Jones won't go from super backup to superstar.\r\nJones proved to be one of the best outside rushers in the SEC, but also has excelled as a kickoff returner. His average of 28.21 yards per kickoff return ranks ninth in NCAA Bowl Subdivision annals.\r\nKnown for his big-play ability, Jones' average yards per carry of 7.66 yards would be one for the college football all-time record books, if not for Glenn Davis of Army averaging 8.26 yards (358 attempts, 2,957 yards, 1943-46). Since Davis, the only players to average over seven yards per carry (minimum 350 attempts) were Mike Rozier of Nebraska (7.16-yard average on 688 runs for 4,780 yards, 1981-83) and Reggie Bush of Southern California (7.32-yard average on 433 carries for 3,169 yards, 2003-05).\r\nThe Razorbacks' tandem of McFadden (1,830) and Jones (1,162) amassed 2,992 yards on the ground in 2007. The only other tandems to gain more yardage in a season in NCAA annals were Barry Sanders (2,628) and Gerald Hudson (369) combining for 2,997 yards for Oklahoma State in 1988 and Reggie Bush (1,740) and LenDale White (1,302) combining for an NCAA record 3,042 yards for Southern California in 2005. \r\nIn the history of college football, having two players from the same team rush for over 1,000 yards each in the same season has been accomplished 41 times. McFadden and Jones (2006-07) and West Virginia's Steve Slaton and Patrick White (2006-07) joined Marion Barber III and Lawrence Maroney of Minnesota (2003-04) as the only duos to accomplish that feat more than once in a career over the last 30 years.\r\nAt Booker T. Washington High School, Jones was named the Tulsa World Player of the Year following his senior season, after rushing for 2,282 yards and 48 touchdowns on 205 carries (11.1-yard average). He led his squad to a 13-1 record and a state runner-up finish, as Jones rushed for 166 yards and three touchdowns in the 5A state championship game. He was sidelined with a broken ankle early in his junior season, but still managed to rack up 800 yards rushing and 20 touchdowns. Rivals.com ranked him the 19th-best athlete in the nation and the fourth-best overall player in Oklahoma. \r\nJones enrolled at Arkansas in 2005, after he originally signed a letter of intent to attend Oklahoma State. He also turned down scholarship offers from Tennessee, Texas A&M, Kansas, Louisiana State and Nebraska. He became the first true freshman in school history to earn first-team All-American honors (as a kickoff returner), when College Football News named him to its postseason team. \r\nHe ranked second in the nation with a 31.94-yard average on 17 kickoff returns for 543 yards and a touchdown. He caught eight passes for 100 yards and gained 11 yards on a punt return. As a tailback, he started two of 11 games, totaling 626 yards with three scores on 99 carries (6.3-yard average), ranking second on the team. He also became only the second freshman in school history to run for over 100 yards twice in a game.\r\nJones garnered All-American honorable mention and All-Southeastern Conference first-team recognition as a sophomore. He started six of 14 games, amassing 1,829 all-purpose yards, the third-best total in the league. He also ranked second in the SEC with 154 carries for 1,168 yards (7.6-yard average) and six touchdowns. He also caught 15 passes for 107 yards (7.1 avg) and three scores. He ranked third in the conference with 23 kickoff returns for 554 yards (24.1 avg) and a touchdown in 2006.\r\nJones was a consensus All-American and All-SEC first-team selection as a kickoff returner, adding Associated Press third-team national honors as an all-purpose back in 2007. He started just three of 13 games, but gained 1,162 yards with 11 touchdowns on 133 carries, as his average of 8.7 yards per attempt set an SEC single-season. He made 16 catches for 176 yards (11-yard average) and ranked fourth in the nation with 652 yards and two scores on 22 kickoff returns (29.64 avg). He also finished 22nd in the country with 1,990 all-purpose yards, an average of 153.08 yards per game.\r\nWith a new coaching staff in place at Arkansas, Jones decided it was best that he follow McFadden. Both Razorbacks decided to enter the 2008 NFL Draft. \r\n\"In the past few weeks I have taken time to consider my football future, and what was the best opportunity for me and my family,\" Jones said. \"My decision has not been an easy one as I have tried to balance my love for this university, this state and the Razor-backs vs. my desire to play in the NFL. Growing up, I dreamed of playing football on Sundays. After considering all of the factors, I am confident that my decision to forgo my senior season to enter the NFL Draft is the right decision. My three years at Arkansas have been some of the bet years of my life.\" \r\nJones closed out his career with 2,956 yards and 20 touchdowns on 386 carries, shattering school and SEC career records by averaging 7.66 yards per rushing attempt, as he started 11 of 38 games he appeared in.

Both are well-built runner with thick frames that are best served running between the tackles, as neither has that blazing speed you want in an outside runner. Mendenhall capitalized from his only season as a starter into a future NFL contract, but while he has made marked improvement in 2007, there is work to be done. He knows how to pick and slide, but there are times he will just run right at a defender rather than elude. His ball distribution needs total refinement, as he has a knack for swinging the ball wildly when he runs. Like Benson, that leads to a high amount of costly fumbles. He is a good receiver out of the backfield and relatively durable, having never missed a game due to injuries. While he should be a first-round pick, with strong post-Combine workouts, he still has a big learning curve ahead of him.",

                "Overview": "A physical inside runner, Mendenhall helped the Illini get back to the national prominence experienced in the 1980s. In his only season as a starter, Mendenhall led the team to a berth in the prestigious Rose Bowl. He went on to set school rushing records for most yardage (1,681) and touchdowns (17) in 2007, while also establishing an annual record with 1,999 all-purpose yards.\r\nWith a low center of gravity and thick legs, Mendenhall was a punishing force running between the tackles. He also showed the quick burst and second gear to elude defenders in the open field. Knowing what professional teams want in a tailback, he worked hard in the offseason to improve his pass-catching ability, almost tripling his reception production as a junior over that of his previous season (34 to 12).\r\nAt Niles West High School, Mendenhall was rated the premier recruit in the state of Illinois by Scout.com, earning a five-star prospect from that recruiting service, which rated him the 24th-best prep player in the country. He was named to Rivals.com's Top 100 team and rated 17th among national recruits by the Atlanta Journal Constitution. He was a member of the Student Sports Top 100 list of senior prospects, adding Prep Star All-American and Dream Team accolades.\r\nMendenhall was also selected the top recruit in the state of Illinois by the Chicago Sun-Times and named to Super Prep's Elite 50 list and All-American squad, ranking as the nation's fourth-best running back by the same publication. He also participated in the Fifth Annual U.S. Army All-American Bowl. The two-sport star was a three-year All-Central Suburban Conference selection for football and two-time pick for track. He was named to All-State teams as a junior in both football and track, in addition to earning All-Area honors for both sports as a sophomore and during his junior year for football.\r\nMendenhall averaged 9.1 yards per carry as a senior, rushing for 1,453 yards on 160 attempts and 14 touchdowns. As a junior, he gained 1,832 yards and 19 touchdowns, while averaging 11.6 yards per carry and recorded 1,300 yards and 21 scores as a sophomore. He also had over 1,000 career yards receiving and 13 touchdown catches. He was the Outstanding Performer at the Illinois Prep Top-Times meet as a junior and finished seventh in the state 100-meter dash as a sophomore. He also lettered in basketball.\r\nMendenhall verbally committed to Illinois as a junior in high school, spurning scholarship offers from Arizona, Arizona State and Northwestern, so he could join his brother, Walter, in the backfield for the Fighting Illini. Walter redshirted in 2004 and both brothers lettered in '05. Rashard was listed third on the depth chart at tailback, appearing in 10 games as a reserve. He managed 218 yards on 48 carries (4.5-yard average) and scored twice on 13 receptions for 82 yards (6.3-yard average).\r\nAs a sophomore, Mendenhall backed up Pierre Thomas, finishing second on the team with 640 yards and five touchdowns on 78 attempts (8.2-yard average).

His 1,120 yards set a school freshman record and he was the team's first 1,000-yard rusher since 1994.\r\nIn 2006, Rice was a consensus All-American second-team choice, adding All-Big East Conference first-team honors. The Maxwell Award finalist became the third player ion school history to produce back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons, as he ranked third in the nation with 1,794 yards on 335 attempts (5.4-yard average) and finished fifth nationally with 20 touchdowns on the ground. \r\nThat year, he piled up 1,824 all-purpose yards, despite being limited by a left ankle sprain the final month of the regular season, earning him The Daily Targum's Male Athlete of the Year. \"Our success in our season came due to hard work,\" Rice said. \"I couldn't have done what I did without my teammates, without my fellow teammate Brian Leonard and my offensive line.\"\r\nAs a junior, Rice became the school's first three-time 1,000-yard rusher.

The result was a huge breakdown in protection up front and frustration by his offensive line and the coaching staff because of it. He soon saw his carries reduced with Noel Devine turning into the team's new darling. Slaton is the first to tell you that he is going to have to bulk up for the next level. While some experts compare him to Philadelphia's Brian Westbrook, he lacks the Eagle's leg drive and inside running ability and is not as versatile. Slaton might be a very good change of pace type of runner, but he could see league rival Ray Rice (Rutgers) get more attention on draft day.

When he began another rash of fumbles, he gradually saw his playing time reduced...Seems to be a reluctant entry in the draft, citing his coach leaving the school for the reason he came out, but it more than likely was due to losing playing time to frosh sensation Noel Devine and the prospect that he would have had to compete for his job next year with the new coaching staff in place...The old staff seemed to lose confidence in him during the second stage of 2007, as they became frustrated by his ball security issues and shyness taking the ball up the gut...Has marginal blocking skills, some due to a lack of desire, but mostly because his size prevents him from gaining leverage vs. the bigger defenders...Does not play up to his timed speed, as he does not consistently show the burst or suddenness out of his stance and into the holes as he showed earlier in his career...Most of his carries have come on pitches and tosses out of the shotgun formation and he will need time to adjust to pro sets and playing closer to the line than he is accustomed to...Might not be able to withstand the punishment of being a featured back and could be better suited for change-of-pace duties...Has improved his receiving skills the last two years, but has been confined to simple, controlled routes...Seems to struggle on long patterns trying to locate the ball in flight and has just marginal timing leaping and attacking the ball at its high point...Will drift and take soft angle cuts as a receiver...Does not have the power to move the pile or break many arm tackles (relies more on his quick feet, fakes and hip snap to elude), as he will generally be captured on the initial hit...Not the type who can digest a complicated playbook and needs more than a few reps to retain...Never used as a lead blocker and has to improve his angles when asked to cut block in the second level.\r",

                "Overview": "It will be strange for Mountaineers fans to gaze out at the football field in 2008 and not see Steve Slaton lining up next to his roommate, quarterback Patrick White. The duo has been nearly inseparable since Slaton arrived on campus in 2005 after West Virginia secured the tailback's services after Maryland abruptly rescinded its scholarship offer to him right after he graduated from high school. \r\nThe Terps' loss would be West Virginia's gain. Slaton would go on to rush for more than 1,000 yards in each of his three seasons. He and White became just the third tandem in major college history to each rush for more than 1,000 yards in consecutive seasons, joining Darren McFadden and Felix Jones of Arkansas (2006-07) and Marion Barber III and Lawrence Maroney of Minnesota (2003-04).\r\nNow, Slaton heads to the National Football League, deciding to leave the school and White behind after head coach Rich Rodriquez suddenly left for the University for Michigan after the 2007 regular season. From what his family is saying, it might have been a reluctant decision on his part. Carl Slaton, Steve's father, told the Daily News his son declared for the NFL Draft because of Rodriguez' departure, \"The NFL draft is a crapshoot. It was not an easy decision, but, in the end, it was pushed on him with Rodriguez leaving and taking the whole coaching staff.\" \r\nSlaton, short on stature and bulk, has had to fight for his place on the football field most of his career, but faced possibly his biggest battle at an early age. As a young child, he was nearly deaf from congestion in his ears. He couldn't make out simple words and needed to hold people's faces steady just so he could read their lips. The problems persisted until he was age six, and a specialist removed his adenoids and inserted tubes to drain the fluid from both ears so he could hear again.\r\nAt Conwell-Egan Catholic High School, Slaton made the varsity football team as a freshman, going on to earn All-Conference honors in each of his four seasons.  He was named the Most Valuable Player of the Philadelphia Catholic League and was chosen All-Area by most of the local news services, in addition to adding All-State accolades as a junior and senior.\r\nAs a senior, Slaton rushed for 1,836 yards and 26 touchdowns to lead the team to a 10-3 record. He added 1,626 yards with 19 scores on offense and broke up six passes while intercepting two others as a defensive back during his junior campaign. For his career, he rushed for more than 6,000 yards and 73 touchdowns, setting five school records. He was chosen to participate in the annual Big 33 Football Classic and also excelled on the school's track team.\r\nWhen Maryland pulled back its scholarship offer, Slaton enrolled at West Virginia in 2005, as he turned down other scholarship offers from Boston College, Minnesota, Ohio State, North Carolina, Rutgers and Wisconsin. He sat out two of the first three games, but after gaining 90 yards off the bench vs. Virginia Tech, he would go on to start the next six contests. \r\nSlaton ranked 14th in the nation in rushing (112.8 ypg) and third in scoring (11.4 ppg), as he led the team with 1,128 yards and 17 touchdowns on 205 carries (5.5 avg), earning Freshman All-American and Big East Conference Rookie of the Year honors.\r\nA consensus All-American and unanimous All-Big East Conference choice as a sophomore, Slaton put together a record-breaking 2006 campaign, despite being forced to carry the ball exclusively in his left hand most of the season due to a right wrist injury that would require surgery. His 1,744 yards on the ground and 2,104 all-purpose yards set school season marks, as he ranked fourth in the nation in rushing (134.5 ypg) and second in all-purpose yardage (161.85 ypg). \r\nThe wrist injury saw Slaton fumble the ball seven times on 248 carries, but he produced 16 touchdowns on the ground and 114 points. He also ranked third on the team with 27 catches for 360 yards (13.3 avg) and two scores. His 27 grabs were the third-best season total by a Mountaineers running back in a season.\r\nPrimed for a banner junior campaign with his wrist fully healed, Slaton ran into several roadblocks in 2007. He tried to get too fancy carrying the ball, spending more time dancing in the backfield than attacking the rush lanes. With frosh sensation Noel Devine now vying for backfield time, fumble issues caused the coaching staff to lose faith in its junior runner in crucial situations, as he saw his chances to carry the ball slowly get reduced each game.\r\nSlaton finished second on the team, barely making it over the 1,000-yard mark with 211 carries for 1,051 yards (5.0 avg) and 17 touchdowns. He also ranked second on the squad with 26 catches for 350 yards (13.5 avg) and a score, tallying 108 points. He also piled up 1,448 all-purpose yards.\r\nIn 36 games at West Virginia, Slaton started 32 contests. He rushed 664 times for 3,923 yards (5.9 avg), the third-best total in school history. His 50 touchdowns on the ground set a WVU all-time record. He caught 65 passes for 805 yards (12.4 avg) and five scores, as he totaled 330 points. He gained 47 yards on two kickoff returns and recorded three tackles while amassing 4,775 all-purpose yards."

                "Analysis": {
                    "Compares To": "JUSTIN FARGAS-Oakland...Like Fargas, Smith is very effective when he runs at a low pad level. He has excellent pick-and-slide agility and builds his acceleration nicely. He is used mostly on controlled routes, but is efficient as an underneath receiver. He needs to add bulk to his frame, but with his pitter-patter running style, he has good avoidance skills to escape trash running inside. He might run into spots at times, but shows good patience following blocks. Put him with a formidable offensive line and his bulk issues won't be much of a factor.",
                    "Negatives": "Has decent muscle tone, but lacks ideal frame thickness, especially in the lower body (looks more like a cornerback than running back)...Has had a high amount of carries and while he showed good durability, he needs to have his work load reduced in order to be more effective...Needs to show better vision running through the rush lanes (will run into spots, evident by the fact that he was tackled for losses 41 times and stopped for no gain at the line of scrimmage 48 times in 2007)...When he gets to tall in his pads, defenders have better success pushing him back, as he does not have the lower-body strength to push the pile...Needs to become more creative and adjust quicker to threats when on the move...Runs hard when he keeps his pads down, but is not the type to punish defenders...Shows good acceleration out of his cuts, but is more of a pick-and-slide type than one that can simply explode through the creases...Has decent willingness as a blocker, but is not a contact seeker...Used mostly on slants and screens as a receiver, as he struggles to adjust to the long throws with his back to the quarterback.\r",
                    "Positives": "Has the frame to carry at least another 10 pounds of bulk with no loss in quickness...While he lacks ideal strength to move the pile, he has good stop-and-go agility to elude...Has superb pick-and-slide skills, showing shifty lateral moves and very good feet to break free for big yardage into the second level...Compensates for a lack of lower-body power with very good flexibility, showing the quick-twitch movement and burst to accelerate past defenders in the open field...His loose hips allow him to adjust and redirect to cutback lanes without having to throttle down much...Tough and competitive athlete who will play with pain...Has a decent team attitude and, except for one incident -- was suspended one game in 2006 for a curfew violation -- has been compliant to the wishes of the coaching staff...Runs with good leverage and balance, keeping his feet when turning the corner, as he shows the ability to bounce off tackles...Has the second gear and in-line acceleration to make the first tackler miss...Gets most of his yardage in the open field thanks to his burst through the hole...His suddenness out of his stance helps him get an advantage and you can see on film how his lateral quickness helps him duck in-and-out of the crowd working in-line (not the type to move the pile)...Will run into spots at times, but generally shows good anticipation skills to find the openings...Uses and sets up his blocks well, showing the balance to pick his way around a crowd...Can push the ball some after contact, but is best when he eludes rather than trying to overpower...Very elusive in space and if he locates a crease, he can take the ball the distance...His burst is evident when reaching the corner and he can immediately accelerate out of his cuts...Even with his speed, he can be deceptive on the perimeter, where he gets a lot of carries and had success outrunning the defender in space...It is very rare to see him gather before making the cut and his shifty feet will usually cause defenders to miss trying to tackle him in the short area...Covers the ball well on contact and has enough upper-body strength and ball security that fumbles won't be an issue...Runs crisp short-area routes, but is best used on screens and dump-offs (needs to look the ball in better on long routes)...Has that natural feel for the rushing lanes and does a good job of picking up his feet to side-step trash...Shows great effort to finish his runs and while he might not have great bulk, he has become an adequate cut blocker, taking good angles to stalk second level defenders.\r"

                "Overview": "Kevin Smith was well aware of the number 181 as he prepared to play in the 2007 Liberty Bowl. \r\nSmith was 181 yards shy of the NCAA single-season rushing record of 2,628 yards set by Barry Sanders at Oklahoma State in 1988. Smith fell 62 yards short, but set another record with 450 rushing attempts, topping the single-season mark of 405 carries by Marcus Allen of Southern California in 1981. Smith's 180 points scored in 2007 rank fourth on the NCAA list.\r\nThe school's all-time leading rusher after just three seasons, Smith proved to be durable and a true workhorse for the Knights during his junior year. He was a model of consistency, scoring at least once in 12 of the 14 games in which he appeared. He registered 13 100-yard rushing performances, including five games of at least 200 yards and a career-high 320 yards vs. Alabama-Birmingham.\r\nSmith lettered three times in football at Southridge High School. He was a two-time All-Dade County selection as both a running back and free safety, recording 53 tackles with four interceptions during his senior season. He scored a touchdown on both a punt return and fumble recovery. As a junior, he rushed for 1,125 yards and 15 touchdowns. He was also a member of the school's Academic Honor Roll.\r\nSmith was not heavily recruited coming out of high school, choosing Central Florida over Akron in 2005. He went on to earn Freshman All-Conference USA honors, as he set the school freshman rushing record with 1,178 yards and nine touchdowns on 249 carries (4.7-yard average). His 1,178 yards rank fourth on the school's overall season rushing list. He also had eight receptions for 44 yards (5.5-yard average), as he produced five 100-yard efforts on the ground.\r\nAs a sophomore, Smith earned second-team All-Conference USA honors, despite missing three games. He was suspended vs. South Florida for a violation of team curfew and sat out the final two contests vs. Tulane and Alabama-Birmingham with a right shoulder injury. He finished with 206 attempts for 934 yards (4.5-yard average) and seven touchdowns, adding 158 yards on 23 catches (6.9 avg).\r\nSmith was a consensus All-American and All-Conference USA first-team choice. The league's co-Offensive Player of the Year -- along with East Carolina's Chris Johnson and Tulane's Matthew Forte' -- produced record-breaking seasons, with Johnson winning the NCAA all-purpose yardage title, and Smith and Forte' were two of college football's three 2,000-yard rushers in 2007. Yet, all three were slighted by the voters for the Doak Walker Award (nation's top running back).\r\nFew could argue that Smith's final season at Central Florida was anything short of outstanding. He scored 29 times on 450 carries for 2,567 yards (5.7-yard average). He hauled in 24 passes for 242 yards (10.1 avg) and a score, recorded two solo tackles and amassed 2,809 all-purpose yards, an average of 200.64 yards per game.\r\nSmith started 34 of 36 games at Central Florida, establishing new career records with 905 carries for 4,864 yards (5.37-yard average) and 45 touchdowns. His 4,864 yards rank second in Conference USA history. He caught 55 passes for 444 yards (8.1 avg) and a score, as he totaled 276 points. He posted four solo tackles and amassed 5,123 all-purpose yards, an average of 142.31 yards per game."

                    "Compares To": "LADAINIAN TOMLINSON-San Diego...Tomlinson and Stewart share a rare blend of power and quickness running between the tackles. Stewart has not had that many opportunities as a receiver, but demonstrates good hands to get to the pass outside his frame. He did not show his outside running ability much, more due to his ankle and other injury problems, but there is no question that he can take the ball to the house when he gets past the line of scrimmage. With his special-teams skills, he will get a lot of playing time as a rookie. With Darren McFadden being the darling at this position, teams really need to examine these two before deciding who will be the first tailback taken. McFadden collides with defenders and runs too tall in his stance to avoid injuries and one look at his performance in 2007 and you will see he had fumbling issues. If Stewart's ankles check out, teams should not hesitate to select him over McFadden. Stewart is less of a risk than either of the Razorback runners and, if his legs hold up, he'll be a punisher in the Tomlinson mold. That's hard to beat.",

                "Overview": "While other running backs received considerable national attention, tucked away in Eugene, Oregon, was an athlete many feel was the most complete running back in college football in 2007 -- Jonathan Stewart.\r\nHe has the size of a fullback, the strength of an offensive lineman and the quickness of a sprinter. Playing with a style that reminds pro scouts of Kansas City's Larry Johnson, Stewart proved, even through injuries, perfectly capable of handling the rushing load.\r\nDespite starting just 25 games at Oregon, he ranks second in school history with 2,891 yards rushing. His 198 points scored is the sixth-best career total in Ducks annals and his 4,889 all-purpose yards rank third on the school's career list. His 1,722 yards on the ground in 2007 was the most ever by a running back at the university and rank ninth on the Pac-10 single-season chart. He also used his 233-pound frame as a kickoff returner, finishing second on Oregon's career charts with a 28.69-yard average and 1,664 yards gained.\r\nFew prospects in the Northwest attracted the attention to the magnitude that Stewart received during his playing days at Timberline High School. The state of Washington's all-time rushing leader accumulated 7,755 yards on the ground with 95 touchdowns in a career in which he eclipsed the 1,000-yard barrier in each of his four prep seasons.\r\nStewart was placed atop the nation's list of running back recruits on Parade magazine's All-American team, Student Sports Hot 100 list as well as Prep Star's Top 100 Dream Team, and was one of five finalists for the Walter Payton Trophy (nation's top prep player). He was named Washington Class 3A Offensive co-Player of the Year and state Gatorade Player-of-the-Year as a senior.\r\nThe tailback was a member of USA Today's 2004 All-USA team, the Long Beach Press-Telegram's Best in the West first-team, the Northwest Nuggets squad by the Tacoma News Tribune and EA Sports' All-American squad. He played in the 2005 U.S. Army All-American Bowl and was named the News Tribune's 2004-05 High School Male Athlete of the Year. Rivals.com rated him the best player in the state of Washington and 10th overall in the nation.\r\nStewart rushed for 2,301 yards and 32 scores as a senior, averaging 11.3 yards per carry, in addition to returning one of three punts 91 yards into the end zone. That year, he had single-game bests of 422 yards rushing vs. Centralia High, including nine touchdowns.\r\nAs a junior, he rushed for 2,609 yards and 36 touchdowns to garner first-team All-State accolades by the Seattle Times and Tacoma News Tribune, as well as state Class 3A Player-of-the-Year praise by the former news organization. \r\nDuring his sophomore year, Stewart gained 1,575 yards on the ground in 2002 before breaking his left ankle. He also competed in track. He placed second in the 2005 state track 100-meter championships (11.17), in addition to anchoring school's 4x100-meter relay to a state title.\r\nOregon won a fierce recruiting battle for Stewart's services in 2005, as he turned down scholarship offers from Southern California, Tennessee, California, Nebraska, Notre Dame and Ohio State. An ankle injury limited him to 10 games as a true freshman, serving as the \"caddy\" for starter Terrence Whitehead. However, the youngster made the most out of limited opportunities, as he averaged one touchdown for every eight times he touched the ball. \r\nStewart would earn Freshman All-Pac-10 Conference honors from The Sporting News. He scored six times on 53 carries for 188 yards (3.5-yard average), returned 12 kickoffs for 404 yards (33.7-yard average) and a pair of touchdowns and caught seven passes for 45 yards and another score.\r\nA series of ankle injuries throughout 2006 was the main culprit preventing Stewart from cracking the 1,000-yard rushing barrier. The second-team All-Pac-10 choice was also hampered by rib cartilage damage, a chest muscle strain and a neck strain as a sophomore. \r\nHe still managed to lead the team with 981 hard-fought yards and 10 scores on 183 carries (5.4-yard average). He caught 20 passes for 144 yards (7.2 avg) and a touchdown, adding 646 yards on 23 kickoff returns (28.1 avg). Despite all of those injuries, he piled up 1,771 all-purpose yards, the fifth-best season total in school annals.\r\nStewart battled a turf toe injury, an ankle sprain and a hand contusion in 2007. He still put together a banner season, setting school records with 1,722 yards rushing and 2,481 all-purpose yards. His average of 132.46 yards per game on the ground, ranked seventh nationally while his average of 190.85 all-purpose yards ranked ninth, leading the conference in both categories.\r\nHe averaged 6.2 yards on 280 carries, scoring 11 times. He gained 614 yards on 23 kickoff returns (26.7-yard average) and snared 22 passes for 145 yards (6.6 avg), including a pair of touchdowns, as he also added one solo tackle vs. UCLA.\r\nIn 36 games at Oregon, Stewart started 25 contests. He carried 516 times for 2,891 yards (5.6-yard average) and 27 touchdowns, turning the ball over three times on five fumbles. He gained 334 yards with four scores on 49 receptions (6.8 avg) and recorded four solo tackles. He also returned 58 kickoffs for 1,664 yards (28.69 avg) and two touchdowns. He wrapped up his career with 4,889 all-purpose yards on 623 touches, an average of 135.81 yards per game."

                "Overview": "One of the more unheralded running backs in the recent USC era of standout ballcarriers, Washington has had to overcome a series of battles to remain on the field. \r\nAt age nine, Washington woke up one morning to find he could not move his legs. The paralysis lasted for more than a week before it just as mysteriously disappeared. \"They still haven't figured out what it was,\" the running back recalls. \"After seven days, I got the feeling back in my legs. It was painful, but I started gaining strength. Next thing I know, I started to walk again. Once I got out of the hospital, I started running faster. For some reason, I felt fast. And no, I wouldn't recommend being paralyzed to everyone...I don't think I'll meet any other challenges like that in my life. It makes you stronger as a person.\"\r\nWhen he arrived at Southern California, academics, more than anything else, prevented Washington from living up to his lofty high school headlines. He was academically ineligible to play during the 2004 and 2005 campaigns. He was also ruled ineligible during spring ball in 2006 and 2007. \"I'm not sure why, to be honest,\" Washington said. \"I just got lazy the first few weeks of school. It's more from not going to classes. I got too much of myself. It happens.\" \r\n\"I got discouraged, but my father picked me up. He said, 'Let's go. You've still got time. You're young. Everything will work out.' It's all paying off...I've waited a long time. You need to have patience. It's just like when you're running with the ball. You need patience then...Some people would have given up after what I went through, but I believe I'm strong and it made me into more of a man to stick with it.\"\r\nInjuries also played a role in holding Washington back. A right ankle sprain in 2003 sidelined him for all but seven games, as he re-injured it during the course of that season. The injury was later diagnosed as a stress fracture. A nagging left hamstring strain in 2006 limited him to just four starting assignments and he later suffered a knee strain that limited his carries near the end of that season. He then missed the 2007 season opener vs. Idaho after suffering a right shoulder strain in August camp.\r\nWashington has also had to battle with conditioning issues, but made a determined effort before the 2007 season to reduce his body fat and increase his stamina. He mainly credits three people for his lighter, sleeker physique. According to the fifth-year senior, Chris Carlisle, Brandon Hancock and George Foreman helped him shed 24 pounds during the offseason. Carlisle, USC's strength coach, provided the workout regimen. \r\nHancock, a former Trojans fullback and bodybuilding aficionado, supplied nutritional advice. Foreman, the former boxing champion, was the namesake for the popular grill on which Washington prepared his high-protein meals. \"Chicken breasts, egg whites -- George Foreman did it all,\" Washington said after arriving at training camp weighing 216 pounds. \r\nAt South Torrance High School, Washington earned 2002 Super Prep, Prep Star and Tom Lemming All-American honors. He added Super Prep All-Farwest, Prep Star All-West, Tom Lemming All-West, Long Beach Press-Telegram Best in the West, Tacoma News Tribune Western 100, Orange County Register Fab 15 and Cal-Hi Sports All-State Medium Schools honors. He was also selected to the All-CIF Southern Section, All-CIF Division X, Los Angeles Times All-South Bay/Westside and South Bay Daily Breeze All-South Bay team.\r\nThe All-Pioneer League Co-MVP ran for 1,549 yards on 140 carries (11.1 avg) with 23 touchdowns and caught 13 passes for 200 yards (15.4 avg) with two scores in 2002, despite missing five games with a knee injury. As a junior in 2001, he was named to the All-CIF Division X, Los Angeles Times All-South Bay, South Bay Daily Breeze All-South Bay and All-Ocean League first teams. \r\nThat season, he gained 1,975 yards on 225 carries (8.8 avg) with 26 touchdowns, plus had 22 catches for 273 yards (12.4 avg) with two scores and returned 10 kickoffs for 324 yards (32.4 avg). As a sophomore in 2000, Washington made the All-Ocean League first team as he rushed for 1,548 yards on 179 carries (8.6 avg). He also competed for South Torrance's soccer and track (with a best of 10.5 in the 100 meters) teams. \r\nRated the nation's eighth-best running back prospect by Rivals.com, Washington rejected any and all scholarship offers from other universities, as he was determined to play for Southern California in 2003. He lined up as the third string tailback behind All-Americans Reggie Bush and LenDale White. In between his ankle problems, he carried the ball 19 times for 65 yards (3.4 avg), caught one pass for 6 yards and recorded three tackles.\r\nAcademics kept him away from the team during the 2004 and '05 seasons. He was still academically ineligible for 2006 spring ball, but improved his grades in summer school to rejoin the team for the 2006 campaign. \r\nWashington started four of 12 games while battling with a left hamstring injury for most of the year. He still managed to lead the team with 744 yards and nine touchdowns on 157 attempts (4.7 avg). He added 93 yards on nine catches (10.3 avg) and recorded a solo tackle. Later in the year, he was also limited by a knee sprain.\r\nWashington again struggled with academics before the 2007 campaign and then had to deal with a right shoulder contusion in fall camp. He did not make his 2007 debut until the team's second game and returned to the starting lineup the following week. He earned All-Pac 10 Conference honorable mention, as he led the Trojans with 195 carries for 969 yards (5.0 avg) and 10 touchdowns, adding 59 yards with two scores on seven receptions (8.4 avg). During the season, running backs coach Todd McNair said, \"Chauncey is more powerful than some of the smaller guys and more shifty than the big guys. He's got a unique power-speed combination.\""

                "Overview": "What Brown might lack in size and bulk, he makes up for with strength and speed. His biggest obstacle has been injuries, having missed 11 contests during his career due to various ailments. He still went on to rank fifth in school annals with 529 carries for 2,646 yards during his career. His average of 22.7 yards per kickoff return placed him seventh on the Bulldogs' all-time record list and his 3,767 all-purpose yards rank fourth in Georgia history.\r\nBrown was an Atlanta Journal-Constitution Super 11, Super Southern 100 and Class AAAA All-State choice as a senior at Tucker High School. He added Fox Sports Net All-South second-team, Super Prep Elite 50, All-American and All-Dixie accolades. He was also a Rivals.com Top 100, Southeast Elite, Georgia Top 50 pick and rated the fourth-best running back in the nation by Tom Lemming's Top 100 squad.\r\nThe Prep Star Dream Team 100 choice played in just seven games as a senior due to a broken leg he suffered in a game vs. South Forsyth High. He still rushed for 1,632 yards and 13 touchdowns as a junior, and in seven games during his senior year he added 941 yards and 17 scores. The team finished with a 12-1 record in his junior season and a 12-2 record in his final campaign, when he also started at defensive back.\r\nBrown made an immediate impact during his first season at Georgia, earning Freshman All-Southeastern Conference honors, in addition to being the recipient of the team's Offensive Newcomer of the Year Award and Victors Club Award. Even though he started just three of 11 games and missed the South Carolina clash with a hamstring pull, he still led the team with 875 yards and eight touchdowns on 172 carries (5.1 avg). He caught 16 passes for 150 yards (9.4 avg) and added 18 yards on a kickoff return, finishing his first season as a Bulldog with 1,043 all-purpose yards.\r\nNamed the team's Most Consistent Running Back, the Doak Walker Award list member started 12 games in 2005, sitting out vs. Louisiana-Monroe with a shoulder sprain. He led the team again with 147 attempts for 736 yards (5.2 avg) and four scores, adding 67 yards on six catches. He also threw a 9-yard touchdown pass, as he totaled 822 all-purpose yards.\r\nIn 2006, Brown started five of the team's first seven games, as he was benched for a few contests due to inconsistent play. His season would later come to an end when he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee returning a kickoff vs. Vanderbilt. He still ranked third on the team with 62 rushes for 256 yards (4.1 avg) and a touchdown. He made seven catches for 71 yards and returned 15 kickoffs for 379 yards (25.3 avg) and a score before his injury.\r\nBrown started seven of 10 games in 2007, missing three contests after he suffered a left collarbone break vs. Tennessee. He actually hurt his shoulder in the Mississippi clash when he dove into the end zone at the end of a 50-yard touchdown run. When he returned later in the season, freshman sensation Knowshon Moreno was firmly entrenched as the Bulldogs' starting tailback. Brown managed to total 779 yards with 10 touchdowns on 148 runs (5.3 avg), 84 yards on 10 receptions and 333 yards on 15 kickoff returns (22.2 avg). That gave him 1,196 all-purpose yards for his final campaign.\r\nIn 40 games at Georgia, Brown started 27 contests. He ranks fifth in school history with 2,646 yards on 529 carries (5.0 avg), scoring 23 times on the ground. He snared 39 passes for 372 yards (9.5 avg) and two scores, adding 749 yards and a touchdown on 33 kickoff returns (22.7 avg). He completed one pass for a 9-yard score and recorded four solo tackles, as he amassed 3,767 all-purpose yards, an average of 94.18 yards per game."
