                    "Sources Tell Us": "Weaknesses",
                    "Strengths": "Has experience playing with a hand down or standing. Plays with good upfield explosion in first two steps as a rusher. Has purpose in his rush and gets good forward momentum headed along the rush arc. Uses efficient hand work to swipe and clear a blocker's hands. Uses a punch and rip move to work around the tackle outside hand. Ankle flexion allows for sharper cornering. Can brake suddenly and change direction to give chase against misdirection runs or bootleg quarterbacks. Uses long limbs for expanded tackle radius in his area. Plays with good pursuit speed and range. Able to spot drop in coverage if needed",
                    "Weaknesses": "Durability is a major concern. Missed all but two games in 2016 due to a foot injury and had to deal with a variety of injuries this past season. Blockers slow him dramatically once they get hands on him. Struggles to match power with power when facing up a blocker. Sets a soft edge against tackles and can be dislodged and pushed out of his run fit. High-cut frame lacks strength in lower body. Can be jostled around and out of the play when stunting inside. Doesn't convert speed to power at effective rate"
                },
                "Overview": "Fitts simply hasn't been able to stay at full strength over the last two seasons and it takes heavy digging to find good tape against quality competition because of it. He could be a target for 3-4 teams as a strong-side outside linebacker, but a lack of anchor at the point of attack could chase him into competition for a role as designated pass rusher. He has the talent and traits to play at a higher level than his current grade, but he'll have to prove he can stay healthy.",
                "Player Bio": "Fitts signed with UCLA as a four-star recruit and top 10 defensive end prospect nationally from San Bernardino, California. But after one season there (six games, one tackle on special teams), Fitts decided to transfer away from Westwood to Utah, one of his final choices a year earlier. He redshirted in Salt Lake City in 2014 before earning a starting spot for 11 of 13 games played as a sophomore (eight at left end, three at right end). Fitts showed excellent quickness to the ball and strength in the run game while compiling 41 tackles, eight for loss, and seven sacks, plus he used his power and length to rank ninth in the FBS with four forced fumbles. Primed for a big 2016 season, Fitts instead played in just two games (four tackles, three for loss, 1.5 sacks) before succumbing to a foot injury. Various injuries hindered him in 2017, as he only started 10 games, making 23 tackles that included three sacks."

He was light last year and even lighter this year.\" - NFC West Coast scout",
                    "Strengths": "Watched and learned from his brother, Joe, who was an offensive lineman drafted in the fourth round in 2012. Known for infectious personality and hard-charging style. Instincts are good. Able to sync-up with lateral movements of blockers to penetrate and disrupt. Shows ability to corner sharply and flatten to the ball after getting past blockers. Athletic in space with ability to chase down screens or help finish as a clean-up tackler on the perimeter. Uses quick hands and feet in union to challenge a blockers edge. Possesses decent spin move as rusher inside. Quick arm-over move can launch him past guards into the backfield for a quick win. Initial quickness and loose upper body make it difficult to trap him",
                    "Weaknesses": "High-cut with thin calves for interior player. Doesn't have frame to carry necessary mass for interior lineman. On skates when true power comes rolling downhill against him. Gave ground too frequently to power this season. His 2016 tape and production was much better than 2017. Looked out of place in Cal's 4i alignment. Pops up too tall early in the rep. Poor pad level makes it challenging to maintain functional balance against redirect blocks. Hands are faster than strong. Sets himself up to disengage from blocks, but doesn't have the strength to shed them consistently. May not have a true position fit"
                },
                "Overview": "Looney's quickness and disruptive qualities were on full display in 2016, but he was much easier to block in 2017. He lacks the size and strength to play inside and it appears as though adding functional weight on his frame is a non-starter. Looney will likely need to improve his lean muscle mass and try to transition into a role as a base 4-3 end who might be able to reduce inside as a situational pass rusher in sub-packages.",
                "Player Bio": "Looney grew up around football, as his father James played linebacker at Louisville and his older brother, Joe, played offensive line at Wake Forest and is now a part-time starter in the NFL (fourth-round pick in 2012 by San Francisco). James began his career at Wake Forest, playing in six games (three tackles, half-sack) as a true freshman in 2013. When head coach Jim Grobe was let go, Looney decided it was best to move on. He chose Cal, as brother Joe was with the Niners at the time (he's now with Dallas) and he liked the Cal coaching staff. In 2015, Looney played in 12 games (starting 11), made 35 tackles, three for loss, and a sack. He was an honorable mention All-Pac-12 selection in 2016, starting all 13 games with 54 tackles, eight for loss, and 3.5 sacks. "

Spent his final season playing press corner for the first time during his career. Able to big-boy his level of competition off the snap. Consistently effective at landing hands into receiver's frame to slow release into route. Has mirror and match capability early in route and uses length to help maintain contact through route breaks. Plays under control. Crowds receivers down the field. Keeps watch on play development in man coverage and is quick to peel off and come support the run. Aggressive, wrap-up striker who drives feet and finishes. Shows off desired lateral range and athletic ability in run support",
                    "Weaknesses": "Has a hitch in transitioning against inside release. When beaten cleanly from press, he grabs rather than trusting his feet and technique. Instincts and anticipation are very average. Rarely gets an early jump on throws and relies on seeing it coming first. Too willing to cover grass rather than reading quarterback and making a play outside his area. Quick route specialists give him trouble. Lateral transitions are sluggish in man coverage.Sits in a blocker's sweet spot too long. Needs to get better at attacking and shedding earlier"

                "Overview": "Intriguing prospect with good size and physicality who is just learning to play cornerback. Neal has limitations in coverage but may factor as a bump and run specialist. Neal lacks the ball production and instincts of a high safety, but he has the toughness to play near the line of scrimmage and the cover talent to match up against tight ends. Neal's position fit could depend on scheme as well as how he ends up running. He has NFL traits and could become a productive backup or eventual starter.",
                "Player Bio": "Neal has already tasted the pleasures of parenthood at 24 years old, being the proud father of twin daughters, Londyn and Lauryn. He's also received twin first-team All-Ohio Valley Conference accolades the past two seasons. He was a linebacker in 2016, making 80 tackles, 11.5 for loss, an interception and four pass break-ups. Coaches moved Neal to cornerback for his senior year, and he rose to the challenge with 39 stops, one interception, and a team-high 11 pass break-ups. Neal played safety as a redshirt sophomore in 2015 (one start in 15 games, 40 tackles, one interception, three pass break-ups) after being a reserve defensive back the previous year (32 tackles, three pass break-ups)."

                    "Strengths": "NFL-worthy size with thick hips and powerful upper body. Can be very intimidating at point of attack. Able to overpower lighter guards and usually pummels centers when isolated on them. Has power to press blockers off of his frame and the hip rotation and flexibility to dislodge them. Also utilizes booming hump move that can topple blockers off their base as a pass rush counter. Able to grow roots and own his grass when pad level is right. Two-gap defender. Can punch, lock out, and locate the ball. Above average pursuit quickness for a big man. Able to shed blockers and range to down the line of scrimmage to squeeze running lanes and make tackles. Violent hands can clear hands from his frame or soften the blocker's edge when he's rushing the passer. Has serious bull-rush ability once he gains momentum early in rush. Still very raw with much more talent to unlock",
                    "Weaknesses": "Loses his feet and hits the turf too often. Base and footwork can be compromised when he gets too far out over his toes. Has a tendency to allow pad level to rise too much during rep. Lacks feel for double teams and blocking schemes. Second block catches him off-guard and he often does not have hands in position to work against doubles. Initial get-off is below average. Heavy-stepper as a pass rusher. Doesn't have flexibility or foot quickness to win around the edge as pass rusher. Too quick to default to brute force over technique. Teams may view him as run down player only"
                },
                "Overview": "Vea's tape can frustrating because he flashes star potential one series and then looks average the next. With that said, he's still very raw and should be judged by his ability rather than just his results as he should unlock his potential with more coaching. Vea has the size and power to play nose in an odd or even front and he could be targeted by 3-4 teams looking for dominant run defender on the end. He should work into a defensive line rotation immediately and has the ability to become a good NFL starter for years.",
                "Player Bio": "Vea's combination of size and light feet are rare. In fact, even at about 350 pounds he was lining up as an edge rusher at times in 2016 to take advantage of his genetics. While only starting five of 14 games played as a sophomore, Pac-12 coaches voted him second-team all-conference after he compiled 39 stops, 6.5 for loss, and five sacks. Vea played in all 13 games as a reserve in 2015, posting 17 tackles, three for loss, and a sack. His play late in the year portended a bright future, though, as he forced a fumble against Washington State in the Huskies' Apple Cup win and had a sack in their bowl game.  Vea did not qualify academically after finishing his high school career in Milpitas, California (eight sacks, 578 yards, 11 touchdowns rushing as a senior). He missed the 2013 season while staying home to take online courses to get himself eligible for the following fall when he redshirted with the Huskies. "

                    "Strengths": "Robust build with burly booty. Low center of gravity increases leverage along interior. Possesses outstanding play strength and can chunk plates around in the weight room like it's nothing. Has good snap quickness. Able to attack gaps or read and react as 2-gapper. Keeps eyes peeled on ball-carriers. Can stick and shed blockers to catch runners darting through his gaps. Lateral agility and low pad level make him hard to secure and pin on move blocks. Productive tackler with good range. Leverages gap and works to maintain run fits. Shows ability to recover when attacked and dislodged from angle block. As a pass rusher, can counter from gap to gap when facing single block. Utilizes a swim and a quality slap and rip to attack the edge. Has lower body drive to generate some pocket push",
                    "Weaknesses": "Despite his compact build and quality mass, is still undersized by NFL standards as interior player. Will get big-boyed at times when he's facing a wide-body with power. Needs to win early with his hands to stay ahead in the rep. Can still improve quickness to diagnose run direction. Base is a little inconsistent through contact and he will lose some ground against quality double teams. Pass rush loses steam when guards land a stiff, initial jab to start the rep"

Nnadi has a good motor, active hands and enough pass rush ability to cause problems for blockers up front. Nnadi has the physical tools to play in one or two-gap schemes and has NFL starting ability.",

Few will outwork him, however, as he was named a third-team All-ACC selection, compiling 56 tackles, 10 for loss, and 3.5 sacks in 13 starts. ACC coaches named him first-team all-conference in 2016 after earning the team's Defensive Most Improved Player award in the spring. Nnadi started 11 of 13 games played, fighting through an early-season ankle injury to be credited with 49 tackles from the middle, 10.5 for loss, and six sacks. He collected third-team all-conference accolades from league media as a sophomore, starting every game (45 tackles, two sacks), following a true freshman campaign that saw him on the field for nine games (18 tackles, six against Georgia Tech's triple-option rushing attack in the ACC Championship Game). Despite his lack of height, Nnadi was considered a top 10 defensive tackle prospect nationally after amassing 33 sacks in his final two years of high school ball."

Hips stay under his hands. Low center of gravity and powerful base allows him to play under and through redirect blocks once he gets to the edge. Has fast-twitch initial hands. Punches first into opponent's shoulders preventing them from capturing his frame. Features very little wasted motion in his play. Hands can be violent and sudden. Shows some two-gap ability as a shade nose. Never stops hustling and is willing to chase a tackle opportunity all over the field",
                    "Weaknesses": "Lack of length hinders him. Gets caught up in traffic and can be engulfed by bigger bodies if he doesn't take control with his early hand usage. Has issues getting a full discard when shucking blockers. Wash blocks gain momentum on him and take him out of the play. Would like to see more initial diSenioruption off the snap.

Able to disengage and gather into a tackle-ready position quickly. Uses long arms to ensnare, wrap, and finish runners. Has tools to be an edge-setter against tight ends. Hands are active and can swipe away outside hand of tackle to help grease the edge. Capable of flipping hips over the top of pass setting tackles.

                    "Strengths": "Long, angular frame that is hard to square up for blockers. Twitchy long-strider in open field with loose hips and rare pursuit speed. Excellent reactive athleticism. Uses quick, darting shuffle steps to elude second level blockers and mirror runners cutting from gap to gap. Played with desired discipline and gap integrity in holding 2016 MEAC Offensive Player of the year and current Chicago Bear, Tarik Cohen, to his worst performance. Pads stay square to the line. Posted high-impact production for four consecutive years. Patient tackler. Blazing closing speed and outstanding sideline-to-sideline range. Eyes process quickly. Piled on 19 tackles in loss to Clemson in 2016. Effective playing off of blocks and finding the ball carrier. Fluid in zone drops or when matching up in man coverage. Has six career interceptions",
                    "Weaknesses": "After adding 50 pounds during his stay in college, his frame may be beginning to max out. Thin through arms and chest and lacks desired, NFL play strength. Has very little margin for error when taking on climbing offensive linemen. Doesn't always take efficient routes around traffic in his pursuit. Play demeanor lacks aggression usually spotted at linebacker. Relies on athleticism to slip blocks on second level rather than racing downhill ahead of them. Willing hitter but needs to add more pop behind his pads. Can still improve instincts and pattern reading in man coverage"

He lacks play strength and there are times you want to see more nasty in his field demeanor, but he has the traits and talent to become a good, three-down linebacker who can play 3-4 inside backer or 4-3 WILL.",

Clemson only offered him a preferred walk-on invitation, however, so he decided to take the ride at SCSU. Leonard has played like an FBS recruit for the Bulldogs, playing the run inside, coming off the edge as a pass rusher, and making plays in coverage. He garnered MEAC Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2016 with 124 tackles, 14.5 for loss, 3.5 sacks, two interceptions, three pass break-ups, and four forced fumbles.

Always flowing downhill looking to make plays near line of scrimmage. Quick recovery against play-action and misdirection. Plays ahead of work-up blocks. Flashes a decent burst to the ball and can close out runners if he's in the area. Pac-man tackler who owns a board full of high scores. Discipline, technique, and patience help him avoid missed and broken tackles. Launches compact build through target points and imposes force on ball-carrier. Well-schooled with hands in taking on blocks. Keeps pads square and leverages his gaps. Perceptive with a nose for screens. Reads quarterback and squeezes routes from zone. Has 24 passes defensed over the last three years",

Has some straight line speed but his short area foot quickness in mirroring play is nothing special. Gets lost behind defensive line when finding the football at times. Ducks head into initial take-on blocks. Can get engulfed by size and stuck on blocks. Will need to improve slipping blocks rather than taking them all on. Tight hips prevent fluid transitions in man coverage. Struggles to get early depth in his drops. Effort blitzer, but unlikely to win in that area on talent alone"

On top of that, he ran a painfully slow forty at both the Combine and his forty that will send him tumbling down the draft board. On the field, however, he is a highly instinctive linebacker who combines physicality with a relentless motor to find his way into play after play.

The Hawkeyes ignored his average measurable to rip him away from Division III Luther College (located in Decorah). As a redshirt freshman, Jewell played in 11 games, starting the final four of the year (51 tackles, one for loss). He was the team's Most Valuable Player in the 2015 TaxSlayer.com Bowl with 14 tackles. Big Ten coaches and media voted him second-team all-conference in 2015, as he started every game at middle linebacker, leading Iowa with 126 tackles, 7.5 for loss. Jewell intercepted a pass in each of his last three games that year. In his junior year, Jewell was a finalist for the Butkus Award as the nation's top linebacker as well as the team's MVP and second-team All-Big Ten (team-high 124 tackles, six for loss, two sacks, nine pass break-ups), using his instincts and hustle to consistently find the ball in the run game and pass coverage. Jewell finished his career on a high note, being named first-team AP All-American and first-team All-Big Ten in his senior year (134 tackles, 13.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks, two interceptions, 11 pass break-ups, one forced fumble).

Recognizes climbing guards and will hit accelerator to climb over them and stay in the play. Does a good job of righting the ship and changing course when fooled by misdirection. Able to pass off and collect receivers seamlessly in zone coverage. Cited by scouts for his leadership qualities",
                    "Weaknesses": "Very average athlete with hips and feet that are a little sticky. Lack of top-end speed and reactive athleticism creates a much smaller margin for error. Will miss tackles when forced to try and make them from challenging angles. Gives an honest effort in pursuit, but gets beat around the corner by runners when it's purely speed vs. speed. More reactive than attacking in his play. Will struggle to leverage his gap against NFL lead blockers. Upright in space leading to slower transitions that lack acceleration"

Hearty hitter looking to run through ball carriers and receivers with a thud. Expected to test well at the Combine. Looks for opportunities to strip the football when ball carrier is sufficiently slowed. Looks fluid in his drops. Has 19 passes defensed over the last two seasons",

Struggles to hold his ground at point of attack. Motor runs hot and cold. Instincts and anticipation are a work in progress. Has to rely on athletic ability to dig him out of holes that his instincts dig. Upfield rush contains a false step. Doesn't often outrace tackles to the edge. Can play faster, but doesn't. Not a toolsy pass rusher and needs to develop better rush plans. Missing a workable counter move. Defaults to bull-rush when a rush lane doesn't present itself early"

He was a Los Angeles all-city pick as a senior, earning a scholarship from one of his hometown schools. Nwosu played in 12 games as a reserve his true freshman year (nine tackles), but was sent home before the team's Holiday Bowl appearance for fighting with a teammate. He did not enroll in school in the spring of 2015, but realized he missed the game so he returned for the fall.

Now, NFL scouts are giving him high marks for his on-field performance, especially after a first-team All-Pac-12 senior year where he led UCLA with 110 tackles, 8.5 for loss, one sack, and three passes deflected.

Despite playing in 10 games (all starts), Victor was voted first-team All-Pac-12 (67 tackles, three for loss) because of his willingness to chase any play or fill any hole with his strong presence. His aggression did get the best of him at times, like when he was suspended for the first half of the Oregon contest that year after being ejected for a targeting call against USC. His senior season did not end as expected, with a suspension after a DUI charge leading Victor starting just five times in nine games (30 tackles, two for loss, three pass breakups). Victor played well as a sophomore starter (11 of 13 games played), garnering honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice with 95 stops, nine for loss, 1.5 sacks, an interception (returned for a touchdown) and six pass breakups. He made an impact on special teams early in his career, receiving the team's Special Teams Scout Squad MVP award during his 2013 redshirt season, and then playing in 10 games on coverage units -- making two of his five tackles for the year against Washington State in the Apple Cup.

He was a second-team All-Big Ten pick as a senior, starting all 13 games as the leader in the middle of a young line of first-year starters. "

Shows an ability to generate some initial movement when gallop stepping and landing a shoulder into his double team blocks. Plays with desired level of toughness. Adequate working combo blocks. Will adjust his schedule and look for work when initial assignment voids. Hand placement generally solid. Core strength is okay",
                    "Weaknesses": "Step to snap quickness is slow. Takes too much time getting into down blocks and may let gap shooters leak in on next level. Doesn't have the feet to push defenders out of the play once they get to his edge. Won't unleash as much power from hips as frame would suggest. Down blocks lack pop.

                "Player Bio": "Despite injuring his left knee as a high school senior one season after earning All-State honors in Alabama, Bozeman was offered by the top programs in the country. He stayed in-state, redshirting in 2013 to get his knee healthy, and then playing in nine games in 2014, starting two when future first-round pick Ryan Kelly was injured. Kelly played every game as a senior, limiting Bozeman to a reserve role at guard and center, as well as special teams units. Bozeman stepped in for the current Indianapolis Colt admirably in 2016, starting all 15 games. He garnered second-team All-SEC honors in his senior season, starting all 14 games for the national champs. His ability to move the line of scrimmage while also moving to second-level targets allowed the Tide to move the ball efficiently through the ground and air. Bozeman made headlines by proposing to his girlfriend after the Tide's win in the College Football Playoff Championship Game."

Contact balance and body control are excellent. Plays with an aggressive, finishing demeanor on every snap. Flashes outstanding upper body strength to turn defenders out of the run lane. Once he digs his hands into an opponent's frame, they are done. Feet are nimble and quick. Quality pull blocker and has feet to mirror most pass rushes. Plus lateral movement.

Strong desire to come out fast and land a heavy blow causes hands to miss their mark and ride up high occasionally. Too willing to initiate contact without gathering feet under him. Can be herky-jerky in approach to second level targets and lacks some smoothness in his climb. Needs to play with better pad level in space and on down blocks.

Takes good angles up to linebacker as backside blocker and has technique and athleticism to reach and secure blocks others may struggle with. Offers tackle-level pass technique if bumped inside. Has body control and balance and feet to handle counter rush moves. Extremely aware against twists and quick to respond.

He was a second-team All-American and first-team All-SEC selection in 2017, starting all 15 games on the outside to lead the way for the team's excellent running backs and protect freshman quarterback Jake Fromm. Wynn was a four-star recruit and top-10 guard prospect nationally out of Lakewood High School in St. Petersburg, Florida before joining the Bulldogs. He played in 11 games as a true freshman, starting once as a second tight end. Wynn began his sophomore year at the left guard spot, starting eight games there before moving over one spot to his left for the remaining five games. The transfer of Tyler Catalina from Western Carolina to Georgia forced Wynn to slide back to the left guard spot in 2016, where he started 12 times (missing one game due to injury). "

Usually gets to his work-up targets as combo blocker. Adequate hand placement in pass pro. Considered a team leader and determined worker. Went from walk-on to four-year starter",

Lacks quality leverage and leg drive and may struggle to displace strong, interior lineman as base blocker. Allows defenders to slip out of his grasp when his hands placement falters.

Corbett was named a team captain as a sophomore in 2015 and garnered honorable mention All-Mountain West honors after starting every game at left tackle. Corbett started every game at left tackle again (though like Bitonio, his NFL future is as a hard-nosed but athletic guard) as a junior, playing well enough to gain second-team all-conference from league coaches.

I think he has a lot of work to do.\" - NFL offensive line consultant",
                    "Strengths": "Has an NFL frame with room to pile on more muscle. Has adequate dip and scoop hip flexion to create leverage as a drive blocker. Does a good job of working hip-to-hip on double-team blocks. Hand strength is solid. Can latch onto defender's jersey with his hands to help him ride out the block. Runs feet under initial contact for improved sustain as run blocker. Comfortable quick-setting on top of edge rushers. Shows ability to hasten pass slide rather than using cross-over footwork to catch rushers at the top of the arc. Can pass set with good posture when he wants to. Good athlete in space. Leads the charge when asked to pull and is comfortable handling screen blocking duties",
                    "Weaknesses": "Prolonged tape work offers plenty of inconsistencies in performance. Technique slips when matched against power. Will lean and engulf with wide hands in pass pro. Rushers who ramp up speed-to-power are a problem for him. Wide hands open his frame to stab moves that walk him into quarterback's face. Fails to gain early ground in kick-slides. Opens outside hip early in pass sets giving rushers a much softer edge to attack. Needs to play with faster hands and a more efficient punch. Takes inefficient paths to easy wall-off blocks allowing defensive ends to slide inside his block. Inconsistent getting to his lateral blocks"

                "Overview": "Noteboom flashes the technique, hand usage, and athleticism you want out of the position but he doesn't do those things with enough consistency. His inability to gain and secure positioning as a move blocker is a concern as is his consistency as a finisher in running game. Noteboom was one of the tackles who flashed at the Senior Bowl in one-on-one drills and had a great workout at the Combine. The tape says day three, but his work during the \"draft season\" should get him drafted on the second day with a chance to become an early NFL starter.",
                "Player Bio": "Noteboom was a lean and athletic honorable mention all-state pick from Plano, Texas before signing on with the Horned Frogs. The three-time All-Academic Big 12 pick has not missed a game since redshirting the 2013 season. He played as a reserve in 2014, then took over the right tackle spot for all 13 games as a sophomore. Noteboom moved to the blind side for 2016, starting every game and showing agility in pass protection that NFL scouts admire at the position despite growing into his frame. Big 12 coaches voted him honorable mention all-conference as a senior, as he started all 14 games at the left tackle spot."

Able to gather and cut quickly as inside zone and gap runner. Has good burst after cuts. Flashes acceleration to climb past linebackers and onto safeties quickly. Six of his touchdown runs went for 16 yards or more this year. Stout lower body can rip through arm tackles and allows for plus balance through contact. Has good open field vision to extend runs with second level moves, but will drop his pads and meet force with force when it's time to finish. Understands the art of setting up lead blockers and pulling guards. Highly respected, vocal leader. Excellent in blitz pickup. Understands his blocking responsibilities and will square up and take on rushers. Two-year captain",
                    "Weaknesses": "Has some tightness in his hips. Lack of agility precludes him from making late cuts to elude incoming tacklers. Low knee action in early stages of the run causes him to trip over blockers feet when trying to squeeze through tight running lanes. More angular runner than one who can make sharp cuts. Had some huge rushing lanes to work with thanks to scheme and improved blocking in 2017. Open field balance is inconsistent. Plays with a head-down, raging-bull mentality in short yardage and needs to improve his feel for finding creases. Will duck head and finish prematurely if he doesn't see an early opening to work with. Serviceable as pass catcher, but has had issues catching it cleanly"

                "Overview": "Michel is a well-built, no-nonsense runner who is able to combine vision, burst, and physicality. While he can make open field cuts to find additional yardage, his running style is more angular in nature and he thrives when playing north-south. He's not the most creative runner and he lacks some finesse, but his size, pass protection and ability to create yardage make him a natural fit as a future NFL starter.",
                "Player Bio": "Michel (pronounced ME-shell) is the son of Haitian immigrants who found jobs after their son gained fame for his play at the high school level (he began carrying the ball for American Heritage High as an eighth-grader). The USA Today Florida Player of the Year as a senior, Michel was rated among the top 20 recruits in the country. He got work as a true freshman (64 rush, 410 yards, five TD; 7 receptions, 106 yards, TD), playing in eight games and gaining a start in the Belk Bowl against Louisville. Michel was the team's Offensive MVP and earned the Charley Trippi Most Versatile Player Award as a sophomore by running for 1,161 yards and eight scores on 219 rushes and 270 yards and three touchdowns on 26 receptions. The hits kept coming in 2016, as the team captain ran behind his pads, broke ankles and accelerated into the open field on his way to 840 yards and four scores on 152 carries (22 receptions, 149 yards, one TD). Michel won Offensive MVP award in the Liberty Bowl win over TCU by gaining 87 rushing yards and 39 receiving yards while scoring twice. Though he started only two games in 2017, scouts saw his immense potential in 14 contests; Michel ran for 1,227 yards on just 156 totes, an outstanding 7.9 yards per attempt, and scored 16 times on the ground. He also showed his wiggle and power on nine receptions covering 96 yards and a touchdown for the SEC champions. "

Build produces some natural power and contact balance when he keeps his play speed up. Uses upper body strength to shrug off angle tackles who come in too high. Plays with a feel for block development. Field vision is good. Uses well-timed throttle downhill behind wash down blocks. Willing interior runner in Ducks inside zone heavy attack. Shows off quality footwork and directional change to keep runs alive when defenders beat their blocks early in rep. Contorts to shape of the run lane and squeezes through. Has power in his lead shoulder when challenging safeties in open field. Understands where run track is supposed to lead him. Used as screen receiver over last two seasons but can catch it. Could become a third down option if he improves pass protection",
                    "Weaknesses": "Doesn't always play to his size. Too willing to eat contact rather than dole it out. Can be slowed by arm tackles. Hip tightness prevents him from consistently slipping leg tackles on perimeter runs. Jump cuts gain limited ground. Appears to anticipate contact at times when attacking run creases. Below average elusiveness once defenders close him out in the open field. Tires are missing some tread. Has had over 1000 touches during his career. Has become more of a grinder than a slasher as his career has moved forward. Lacks an explosive \"get-away\" gear to pull away from tacklers"

Freeman's high number of career carries will bother some teams as he doesn't appear to play as fast as he did earlier in his career. He has outstanding size and is a natural runner with good vision who could step into an early starter's role -- especially if teams believe he can handle third down snaps as well.",
                "Player Bio": "Over the past decade, the Ducks have had a string of dynamic offensive playmakers. Freeman's next on that list. An All-State back out of California (2,824 rush yards, 41 scores), the thickly-built alpha back stepped up to start 11 games as a true freshman. He was named the Pac-12 Offensive Rookie of the Year and a Freshman All-American with 1,365 yards and 18 touchdowns on the ground (16 receptions, 158 yards, one touchdown). Freeman redoubled his efforts as a sophomore, earning first-team All-Pac-12 honors (1,836 rush yards, 17 scores; 26 receptions, 348 yards, two touchdowns). But just as Oregon fell flat in 2016 with a 4-8 record, Freeman struggled throughout the season. He failed to get to 1,000 yards (945) and scored just nine times (seven in the first five games), but had a knee injury that restricted the explosiveness he had shown in previous years."

                    "Strengths": "Tapered, powerful physique. Is a punisher behind his pads. Can absorb solid blows and keep runs alive. Will always fall forward once he gets a head of steam behind him. Plays with steady tempo. Has surprising ability to gather weight and cut sharply downhill as outside zone runner. Generally comfortable making reads and choosing track from I-formation. Tackling him high ends poorly for defenders. Able to create additional yardage through power and long speed. Able to batter defenses late in game and then hit the chunk play. Short yardage touchdown specialist who can leap up-and-over the pile. Had dominant stretch against Auburn, Florida, Washington and Clemson late last year. Can thump in blitz pick-up. Hasn't had to handle a heavy workload thanks in part to Alabama's committee approach",
                    "Weaknesses": "Plays with upright running style. Frame too accessible for big hitters looking for a slab of ribs. Durability is a major concern. Has suffered through multiple lower body injuries dating back to high school. Long strider who needs a long runway to get to top speed. Doesn't have bend and footwork to string moves together. Too big and leggy to counter sudden penetration in backfield and needs runs to stay on schedule. Impatient with a penchant for crowding lead blockers and eliminating his own escape routes. Burst and feel for running lanes is below average. Defenders got hands on him much earlier in the carry than his teammate Damien Harris. Missing second-level vision to play chess against linebackers"

Scarbrough won't make tacklers miss, but he is a brute force who can add yardage to the end of runs. Scarbrough is a one-cut runner who is best in an under-center rushing attack where he can get carries in bunches. He has the talent to be an effective NFL running back, but durability concerns and a lack of pass catching ability could cap where teams are willing to consider drafting him.

He played football for Tuscaloosa County before his senior year, when he transferred to IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida for his final high school season. He grayshirted, enrolling in January 2015 and participating in spring practices; unfortunately, he suffered a knee injury in the first scrimmage, causing him to miss the first four games of the 2015 season. Scarbrough managed to play in seven games that year, rushing 18 times for 104 yards and one score while Henry cleared 2,000 yards. He only started twice in his sophomore year, but still racked up 812 yards and 11 touchdowns on the ground (four receptions, 22 yards). Scarbrough was the Tide's Offensive MVP against Washington in a College Football Playoffs semifinal with 180 yards and two touchdowns, and only a leg injury prevented him from putting up big numbers in the 2016 title game. He managed 16 carries for 93 yards and two scores in the first half against Clemson.\r\n"

Has adequate acceleration to the edge and is effective with his off-hand at stiff-arming and separating himself from tacklers in pursuit. Shows proper level of discipline to keep runs between the tackles when called for rather than trying to bounce everything outside. Has footwork and feel to slalom through interior traffic and squeeze out hidden creases near goal line. Patient approach and runs with very little wasted motion. Ball security is a plus",

Tends to get bogged down when forced by penetration to make off-schedule moves early in the run. Vision is just okay. Shows occasional hesitance in reading block development. Would benefit by pressing line of scrimmage a little deeper. Would like to see him physically challenge tacklers more often rather than trying to shake them. Doesn't possess run-away speed.

Surprisingly, he returned to play every game in 2016, starting 11. He was not clearly not as explosive a runner as he was pre-injury, but the team captain still presented the power and enough speed to finish with 1,130 yards and eight touchdowns on 224 carries. Chubb finished his career strong, starting  14 games, leading the national runner-up Bulldogs with 1,345 yards on the ground, and scoring 15 times on 223 carries (plus four receptions, 30 yards receiving) and garnered second-team All-SEC honors to finish second in the school's annals in rushing."

Gallup has posted outstanding production during his two years in the Mountain West at Colorado State, but his level of play took a dip in his matchup against Alabama early in the season. Gallup is still a little raw, but is quickly fine-tuning his game and may have the ability to become a good WR2 in the league.",
                "Player Bio": "Only the SAT could keep Gallup from joining a major conference school once he was finished dominating athletics in Monroe, Georgia. He was one of five adopted children (seven total) at home, but stood out around town as a winner of 16 letters (football, baseball, basketball, track). At Butler Community College, Gallup excelled as a freshman (780 yards, 11 touchdowns) but was limited to four games (9 receptions, 74 yards, touchdown) due to injury the following year. That injury cost him some Power Five school offers, but CSU was happy to sign him. The move paid off, as Gallup earned first-team All-Mountain West Conference accolades by catching 76 passes for a conference-high 1,272 yards and 14 scores, working cornerbacks on the sideline, speeding down seams, and going up for the ball with strong hands. He started 11 of 13 games played on the year, and finished the season with a six-catch, 108-yard, three-touchdown performance in the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl.\r\n"

Gets safeties leaning with quality head-fakes at his route stems on posts",

Shows some fight at the point of attack against tackles despite his lack of length. Heavy hitter when tackling. Runs through the ball carrier and makes sure they feel it. Straight-line pursuit speed appears to be faster than expected on tape. Won't go to it often, but has access to an explosive spin move that can win as inside counter when he times it right. Uses low center of gravity and powerful rip move to play through a blocker's edge once he gets the door open",
                    "Weaknesses": "Lacks desired length and can be locked out and handled by athletic tackles. Allows blockers into his frame first. Has some leftover \"sticky\" when attempting to shed a block. Lack of length prevents him from clean disengage. Will win the battle of the punch at point of attack, but lose sight of the ball. Lateral movement and change of direction is labored and a little slow. Tight-hipped, straight-line pass rusher. Plays with heavy feet in his upfield charge as rusher. Short strider with knee bend that is lacking. Can't get hip flip or shoulder turn around the corner"

Street doesn't appear to be a plus NFL pass rusher but his power is intriguing. A team might be interested in asking him to add more weight in an attempt to bump him inside. After tearing his ACL at his pro day, Street will likely see a drop in his draft positioning.",

He was a full-time starter on the Wolfpack's talent-laden front four in 2017, beginning all 13 games, compiling 38 tackles, 6.5 for loss, 3.5 sacks, three pass break-ups, and two fumble recoveries. Street started every game as a junior, too, making 30 stops, nine behind the line with 5.5 sacks on the year, playing with leverage against taller tackles and also able to shed blocks to get to the ball. Street lined up at tackle as a sophomore (moving from end during spring practice), starting 10 of 13 games played, posting 31 tackles, three for loss. He played in 12 games as a reserve in 2014, stopping the ball 23 times during the season. Street was a top 20 defensive end high school recruit nationally after playing two years of high school ball in Georgia and then two years in North Carolina. "

Overshoots targets on second level and roller skate by. Foot quickness below average. May need to play with more vertical sets to help him keep NFL edge benders from turning his corner. Less strong than he is big. Needs to shoot punch with more quickness and less wasted motion. Will open and lunge at times when rushers start to make their turns along the rush arc. Has troubles with redirecting weight with adequate balance. Fails to clamp into defender's frame and sustain blocks through hand strength. Willingness to maul could lead to spike in holding penalties. Limited area of effectiveness as run blocker. Slow lateral movement off the snap. Historically bad Combine results"
                },
                "Overview": "Tackle with poor athlete traits, but rare size and length whose massive frame can work for him in pass protection and against him in the run game. Brown is a waist-bender with shoddy footwork and a tendency to play too straight-legged. These physical limitations create a much smaller likelihood for recovery once he's beaten. With that all said, he typically gets guys blocked and he clearly understands how to use his size and length to his advantage. Brown's physical traits and nasty demeanor give him a chance to become a decent starting right tackle if he can be coached to lessen his physical deficiencies and can keep his weight in check.",
                "Player Bio": "Orlando Brown, Junior is a huge man, just like his late father, Orlando \"Zeus\" Brown, who played in the NFL for 11 seasons. Brown's father passed away at the age of 40 from diabetic ketoacidosis, so now he plays for his memory -- though his father wished he wouldn't. The top 30 offensive tackle prospect redshirted his first year with the Sooners despite his size behind seniors Tyrus Thompson and Daryl Williams. Brown lived up to the hype in 2015 when given his chance, starting all 13 games at left tackle, earning Freshman All-American and honorable mention All-Big 12 accolades. He used his elite length, massive frame, and improving agility to start every game in his sophomore campaign, second-team Associated Press All-American and Big 12 Offensive Lineman of the Year honors. Brown was again among the best tackles in the country in 2017, receiving Outland Trophy finalist, first-team AP All-American, and All-Big 12 notice for protecting Baker Mayfield's blind side."

He is a two-time Mountain West Special Teams Player of the Year and first-team all-conference specialist, first garnering the award by finishing second in the FBS with three kick return touchdowns and a 33.5-yard average return. Penny was a valued reserve back, as well, getting 61 carries for 368 yards and four scores and catching eight passes for 120 yards and a touch. The Norwalk, California native and top 50 high school running back recruit was the team's kick returner as a true freshman, averaging a respectable 25 yards an attempt.

He played well again in 2017, starting all 13 games up front, making 46 stops, 10.5 for loss, with 3.5 sacks."

He redshirted in 2013, and played in just one game the following year. Averett was going to compete for playing time as a sophomore, but biceps and elbow injuries before the season squashed that hope. He also suffered a broken finger before the playoff semifinal against Michigan State, allowing him to play in just six games as a special teamer. Averett finally got his shot in 2016, starting 13 games and playing in all 15 (48 tackles, three for loss, sack, eight pass breakups). He was picked on regularly but used his toughness to stick with plays. Averett was the team's defensive MVP in their national semifinal win over Washington (eight tackles, sack, forced fumble). He was a starter all 14 games of his senior season, posting 48 stops, four for loss, an interception, and eight pass breakups in 2017. Averett has the athleticism for the position, posting the top long jump mark in high school nationally as a junior (25 feet, two inches) and winning New Jersey state titles in the 55-meter dash and high jump.

Can improve re-setting hands against longer defensive tackles. Feet need to follow hands more consistently on redirects rather than leaning.

However, his impatience as a blocker and tendency to charge in head-first will be used against him by savvy NFL opponents if he doesn't get it cleaned up. Price should be a good, early starter.",
                "Player Bio": "Price was actually the Associated Press Division 1 Co-Defensive Player of the Year in Ohio as a high school senior, but moved to the offensive line during his redshirt freshman season because he thought he was \"too meticulous.\" Though he suited up at center on the scout team, coaches moved him to guard, where he started all 15 games (first three at left guard, final 12 at right) on the national champions in 2014. Price earned third-team All-Big Ten honors as an every-week starter at left guard the following year, and then first-team honors on the right side as a junior team captain. He also was named second-team All-American by the Associated Press, Walter Camp Foundation, and other outlets by not only mauling his opponent with excellent upper and lower body strength but also being effective on the move for traps and other run plays. Price won the Remington Trophy as the nation's top center in 2017 and was a unanimous first-team All-American.

Hasn't learned to tie edge burst with hand work to help soften the edge. Long tackles can be a deterrent. Upper body strength is below average. Hasn't shown consistent ability to convert his edge speed into power. Rides on blocks for too long. Lacking consistent grit at point of attack. Would rather chase and tackle than have running play come downhill at him. Can get to tackles but needs to do a better job of wrapping and finishing. Landry's effort level this year didn't seem to match his 2016 tape even before he suffered an ankle injury"
                },
                "Overview": "Landry lacks premium size, but his burst, stride length and ability to dip and rip around the edge give him special potential as an edge rusher. Landry lacks strength at the point of attack and may be a designated pass rusher early in his career. While he can play standing for 3-4 teams, he's at his best with his hand in the dirt as a rusher. Landry can get by as an NFL rusher with just speed and athleticism, but he has an opportunity to become a Pro Bowler if he can improve his hand usage and develop an inside counter.",
                "Player Bio": "There was an inkling throughout the 2015 season that Landry was ready to break out as one of the top defensive ends in college football in his junior year; he did just that. After regularly contributing through his freshman year (11 tackles, 1.5 for loss in 13 games), the powerful end took over as the regular starter the last nine games of his sophomore year, garnering honorable mention All-ACC honors (15.5 tackles for loss, 4.5 sacks, three forced fumbles). He took the next step in 2016, finishing in the top five nationally with 22 tackles for loss, 16.5 sacks, and seven forced fumbles. Landry started 12 of 13 games played and received multiple All-American honors as well as first-team All-ACC notice for his play. In a bit of a surprise, Landry returned to use his quickness off the line, change of direction skills, and supreme hustle for B.C. in his senior year instead of going to the NFL. His numbers dipped a bit in 2017, as he played in just nine games due to an ankle injury. Landry still earned third-team All-ACC recognition with 38 stops, 8.5 tackles for loss, five sacks, and two pass breakups. "

Has adequate reactive athleticism against inside moves. Mirror isn't perfect but is good enough. Has some anchor to sit down against bull-rush. Flexes upper body power to jolt on redirect and down blocks. Catches base block with upward strike and cranks feet to secure. Works double teams with good technique. Impressive agility to adjust to moving targets. Has athletic ability and radar to spring big runs with second level blocks. Comes off first block with smoothness and times up linebackers",

Struggles to find optimal leverage at point of attack. May improve balance as drive blocker with wider base. Body control is below average. Power ends can stack and dislodge him. Approach angles and post-contact footwork are inconsistent. Outside hand is a little weak in pass protection. Will lunge against edge speed at top of the rush rather than sliding feet to protect the arc. Gets fooled by end/tackle twists. Tape shows potential concerns against good inside rush counters.

For two years, he learned behind Taylor Decker, an eventual first-round pick for Detroit. Jones played in 10 games as a true freshman for the national champions, and then in all 13 games as the team's sixth lineman the following year. Once Decker departed, Jones proved he was ready to go, taking advantage of his length and quick feet to garner second-team All-Big Ten honors as the starting left tackle for every game.

Awkward early steps into route develop into powerful, driving strides eight yards in. Surprises cornerbacks with build up speed and consistently gets by them. Accelerates from stems on post routes and creates open deep looks for quarterbacks. Tracks balls like a centerfielder racing for the warning track. Adjusts speed to match ball flight and keeps cornerbacks stacked. Able to go up and come down with the deep ball with the best of them. Deep speed creates cushion for comeback routes underneath. Flashes runaway speed after catch or will get physical to add critical yardage. Worked outside and from slot",
                    "Weaknesses": "Rarely challenged by press coverage in Big 12. Exposure to the route tree is limited. Gives away comeback route with more deliberate vertical push in his route. High cut with body type like a running back. Top-heavy frame causes him to roll into breaks rather than sink sharply into them. Footwork inside routes feels clunky and lack of timing. Doesn't have skillset for fluid, complex routes. Lacks short area footwork and suddenness to win underneath against tight man coverage. Not a smooth, easy pass catcher and tends to fight some throws.

Oklahoma State's interest has paid off, as Washington has been an All-Conference performer (second team in 2015, first team in 2016) for the Cowboys. An all-around athlete who played tennis and won the triple jump and 100 meters in state track as a senior, he wasted no time getting on the field as a true freshman (five starts, 27 receptions, 456 yards, six touchdowns). Washington stepped it up in 2015, leading the FBS with four touchdowns of 70-plus yards and winning the team's Thurman Thomas Most Valuable Offensive Player award (53 receptions, 1,087 yards, 10 touchdowns). He and quarterback Mason Rudolph continued to terrorize defenses in 2016, connecting 71 times for 1,380 yards and nine touchdowns. Washington was a first-team All-Big 12 pick after ranking 11th in receiving yards and yards per reception (19.4), speeding past defenders and showing off excellent body control on the sideline to grab Rudolph's downfield throws. He terrorized defenses again as a senior, being named to multiple All-American teams, a finalist for the Fred Biletnikoff Award, and first-team All-Conference. Washington finished among the nation's leaders in receiving yards (1,549), averaging 20.9 yards on his 74 reception (tops nationally among wideouts with 50 or more receptions) and scored 13 times. "

Samuels was a first-team all-conference selection as a senior, ending up the Wolfpack's leading receiver (76 receptions, 597 yards, four TDs) while being a major threat in the red zone (76 receptions, 404 yards, 12 TDs). He was named third-team All-ACC pick in 2016, leading his team with 55 catches (for 565 yards, seven scores) and finishing third on the squad in rushing (33 rush, 189 yards, six TDs). He was named the Offensive MVP in the Independence Bowl win over Vanderbilt (six receptions, 104 yards, three TDs). Samuels started 10 of 13 games played for the second straight year in 2016, one year after winning All-American, first-team All-ACC, and Pack Offensive MVP honors by leading all tight ends nationally in receptions (65 receptions, 597 yards, seven TDs) and running for 368 yards and nine touchdowns on 56 attempts. In limited touches as a freshman, Samuels showed glimpses of his talent (15 rush, 143 yards, TD; six receptions, 96 yards, one TD). This versatility was not a surprise, as Samuels was the top prospect in North Carolina in high school after putting up 2,300 yards of total offense and 55 touchdowns as a senior."

Able to stick a foot in the ground and explode when changing directions. Has more power at his disposal than he plays with. Possesses speed to close down the corner against stretch plays and jet sweeps. His upfield burst as a rusher can get charged up. Inside moves are a handful for tackles to track",

He had earned a starting role at inside linebacker in 2015, starting three of four games played (10 tackles, two for loss) before a foot injury ended his season. Jacobs ended up being a regular contributor in a reserve role at inside linebacker and fullback in 2016, playing in all 14 games (37 tackles, one for loss, one interception). As a sophomore, the former three-star recruit from San Pedro, California, started once in 14 games played inside (28 tackles, two for loss). The previous year, he played as a reserve outside defender, making seven stops, one for loss."

Shows an ability to attack one-on-one defenders with accurate fades and back-shoulder throws. Able to work from sideline to sideline with his progressions. Accurate timing throws on deep outs are second nature after years in this offense. Has arm talent to uncork accurate strikes when falling off-balance.

Waits too long to cut it loose leading receivers into oncoming traffic. Slow to see blitzers and misses hot routes. Mobility is below average. Sacked 125 times in his career. Pocket poise took downturns at various points during season. Decision making stalls out after getting through early reads. Majority of interceptions came against zone. Nonchalant short touch throws defaulting to back foot releases. Must prove he can win beyond his system. Almost 74 percent of his pass attempts were less than 10 yards"

He didn't quite fit in, however, so he moved back to Logan and had a first-team All-State senior season. He redshirted in his first year in Pullman as a walk-on, but got on the field in 2014, playing in six games and starting three (64.2 percent completion, 1,859 yards, 13 touchdowns, seven interceptions). Falk ran Mike Leach's system to a tee in 2015, earning first-team All-Pac-12 honors after ranking second in FBS by completing 69.4 percent of his passes for a nation-leading 380.5 yards a game (38 touchdowns, eight interceptions). The three-time finalist (and 2017 winner) for the Brandon Burlsworth Trophy award as the nation's top former walk-on played well again in a second-team All-Conference 2016 season (343.7 yards/game--ranked fourth in the country, 70.0 completion percentage-second, 38 touchdowns, 11 interceptions). Falk's accuracy, mobility within the pocket, and smart decisions make him a finalist for the Manning and Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Awards. Falk's senior season did not quite go as planned, as he was benched at times and only managed to receive honorable mention All-Conference honors. He still completed 66.9 percent of his passes (357 completions, 534 attempts) for 3,593 yards, 30 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions in 13 starts. Falk did set several Pac-12 career records, including total offense, passing touchdowns, passing yards, completions, and attempts."

He was voted an honorable mention All-Big Ten pick the following year, starting 12 games and racking up 81 tackles (five for loss, one sack, two forced fumbles). Allen was a third-team all-conference selection by coaches in 2016, as they saw his constant presence around the ball -- typically in a hitting mode.

Willing to throw in front of safeties and attack over top of linebackers in intermediate portion of field. Has steadily improved each season and showed full command of the offense this year. Saw 10 percent of his dropbacks turn into 25-plus yard completions. Puts air under his deep throws and gives receivers a chance to make plays.

His brother, Logan, is a top 200 recruit that committed to play outside linebacker for Clemson starting in 2017. That background and support helped him excel in high school, where he was a finalist for South Carolina's Mr. Football Award as a senior (4,377 passing yards, 64 touchdowns, eight interceptions). It was expected that Rudolph would take a redshirt in 2014, but the Cowboys' starter fell to injury late in the year. He played in three games, starting two, led the team to a comeback win over rival Oklahoma. Rudolph was OSU's MVP in 2015, starting 12 games (missing most of that year's Bedlam due to injury), completing 62.3 percent of his passes for 3,770 yards and 21 touchdowns and nine interceptions. In his junior campaign, Rudolph stood tall in the pocket and earned honorable mention all-conference honors, distributing the ball to either sideline, as well as down the field, for 4,091 yards (ranking eighth in the FBS) on a 63.4 completion rate with 28 touchdowns -- but throwing just four interceptions in the process. While Rudolph is a pocket passer, he also had six rushing touchdowns in 2016. Rudolph finished his career by winning the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm and Sammy Baugh Awards while earning second-team All-Big 12 recognition. He led the FBS with 377 passing yards per game (4,904 total), completing 65 percent of his passes, finishing among the nation's leader with 37 touchdowns while throwing just nine interceptions.  "

He suited up in six games (starting five) in 2013, completing 53 percent of his passes (93-of-175) for 1,083 yards, three touchdowns, and nine interceptions. He started again in 2014, but his performance (50.4 completion percentage, 1,639 yards, eight touchdowns, seven interceptions in 10 starts) did not guarantee him a starting job for the following year. After falling behind in the depth chart in spring 2015, White decided to transfer to Western Kentucky. He redshirted in the fall of 2015 as a transfer student, sitting behind star passer Brandon Doughty. White took over the reins in 2016, and was named second-team All-Conference USA and the C-USA Newcomer of the Year after completing 67 percent of his passes (280-of-416) in the Hilltoppers' wide open system. He used that pitcher's arm to throw strikes around the yard for 4,363 yards and 37 touchdowns against a measly seven interceptions. White's numbers were not quite as impressive as a senior (completed 65.7 percent of his 560 throws for 4,177 yards, 26 touchdowns, and eight interceptions), but he played well enough to be named second-team All-Conference by league coaches."

Fitzpatrick played star early in 2016 and then moved to safety when senior Eddie Jackson was injured. The result? He led the team with six interceptions and 186 interception return yards, returning two more pick-sixes to set the school career record with four. He was named a first-team All-American by multiple outlets for his efforts (66 tackles, five TFL, seven pass break-ups). Fitzpatrick's New Jersey family home was damaged by Hurricane Irene in 2011."

He redshirted in 2013, then played in 11 games as a reserve, making eight tackles, three for loss, and two sacks. Okoronkwo lined up for the first nine games in 2015 (nine tackles, two sacks) before being sat down as an internal discipline. He got his chance to attack the quarterback in 2016, earning a second-team All-Big 12 selection as a junior, making 67 tackles, 12 for loss, nine sacks, three pass break-ups, and two forced fumbles. Sooners coaches sent him into the backfield again in 2017, and he shared the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year award with Texas linebacker Malik Jefferson. Obo posted 76 tackles, a team-high 17.5 for loss and eight sacks, as well as two pass break-ups and three forced fumbles. He was also named second-team All-American with Jefferson by the Associated Press for his efforts."

Edmonds set an FCS record by averaging 21.1 yards per carry against Lafayette (17-359, four touchdowns). Unfortunately, leg injuries limited Edmonds to seven starts in 2017 (136-577, five touchdowns rushing; 11-129 receiving) and squashed his hopes of setting the all-time FCS rushing record.

                    "Strengths": "Long-limbed frame has room for growth. Former high school wideout with plus athletic ability for the tight end position. Good release quickness into routes. Rarely used deep but has that ability. Stride length allows for get-away separation from linebackers. Dangerous after the catch. Used as catch-and-run option on bubble screens. Can make first tackler miss or drop his pads depending on what situation calls for. Blocks with good pad level and desired hip roll at point of attack. Works to improve positioning as blocker. Blocked in-line and as H-back across formation and in space",
                    "Weaknesses": "Uses knock-kneed stance in-line. Play strength doesn't always match listed size. Hands are too deliberate and wide leading to poor placement. Consistently gives away his frame as blocker. Struggles as block finisher. Goes through the motion as route-runner. Rolls into route breaks. Lethargic underneath and slow to open to his quarterback. Inconsistent hands. Slow to make hands catch-ready at times. Needs to do better job of bodying up defenders in space. Had season-ending surgery on MCL in November"

                "Overview": "Herndon's athletic ability will flash on tape, but his college production was pedestrian and he's still very raw. He has TE2 potential if he can improve his upper body strength and hand placement as a blocker. While Miami used him as a \"run after the catch\" option, NFL teams may lock in on his ability to threaten defenses on the second and third levels. Herndon has exciting athletic ability, but there is still plenty of room for improvement before he becomes a factor in the NFL.",
                "Player Bio": "With junior David Njoku receiving much of the attention given to Hurricanes tight ends in 2016, it was easy to overlook Herndon's accomplishments. The top 20 tight end recruit out of Georgia actually started 12 of 13 games for Miami as a junior, catching 28 passes for 334 yards and two touchdowns on the year (3 receptions, 38 yards against Virginia in the team's Russell Athletic Bowl win). Herndon started 11 games his senior season (40 receptions, 477 yards, four TD), but a knee injury ended the year prematurely. The tall receiver with good quickness for his size (and willingness to block) started three times in 13 games played as a sophomore, grabbing 18 throws for 237 yards. Herndon played in only three games his true freshman year, making no receptions, but he got his most of his work late in the season."

Can counter move tight ends with physicality. Pattern reader with 41 passes defensed in three years. Can transition forward from bail or pedal without many false steps. Sinks into chests of boundary targets and gets head around to find the ball. Instinctive and cautious not to bite on double moves. Has early acceleration to recover. Maintains contain responsibilities against run. Roughneck by nature with \"see it, hit it\" attitude. Strike and wrap tackler",

Has decent recovery burst, but has trouble catching up with real gassers who get by him. Lack of long speed could prevent him from staying outside full-time. Will wait for the throw rather than shade from zone. Has no interceptions over last two seasons. Slow to transition from hand usage to footwork as route progresses and will default to some mauling"

Very smart and called the \"brains behind the operation\" on the field. Won't give up his gap control willingly. Plays square and will stick a strong shoulder into blocks to squeeze his gap. Technically sound. Meets climbing blockers with a sunken anchor and a stiff punch. Nice, easy hips allow for smooth drops into coverage. Quick to recognize and react to play-action and screens. Able to weave around blockers without losing sight of the ball",

Hamilton started the first nine games of his senior season before another injury (fractured right kneecap) sidelined him for the rest of the Tide's playoff run (40 tackles, 5.5 for loss, 2.5 sacks). He started five times as a sophomore in 2015, playing in every game of the team's national championship run (27 tackles, 1.5 for loss). The Alabama native was a top 10 inside linebacker prospect coming out of high school and played in all 14 games on special teams as a true freshman (three tackles). Hamilton graduated a semester early from high school and was also his class' valedictorian. "

Forces defensive backs into early retreat. Uses subtle head movement to manipulate safeties out of position. Play speed is electric. Natural ball plucker on the move. Gears down to drop low and secure poor throws and is able to climb up high as well. Touchdown totals could have been doubled with better quarterbacking. Finds open space in scramble situations. Can be lethal after the catch. Uses entire field as his playground. Received almost 33 percent of the team's targets since his freshman year",

Hasn't learned to use hands as press counter. Too easily impeded by contact. Routes can be redirected by quality bump and run talent. Inconsistent using body positioning to leverage target area along deep sideline. Despite natural hands, struggles with focus drops when he senses a hitter nearby. Had 20 drops over three seasons.

His play in 2017 only strengthened his draft stock, as the first-team all-conference selection grabbed 68 passes for 1,085 yards and 12 scores, pairing with Trey Quinn as dual 1,000-yard pass-catchers."

Showed talent to track football early and make late body adjustments to win the contested catch down the field. Focus seems to sharpen on 3rd downs and near goal line. Almost 80 percent of his catches in 2017 went for first down. Adds yards after catch with subtle side-steps and quality play strength. Scouts say he's described as \"special\" and \"unselfish\" by everyone around him. High-achiever. Team captain who takes time to teach younger players",

While his size is a bonus for teams who like big-bodies in the slot, how he runs and tests could go a long way into if and when he gets drafted.

League media made him an honorable mention pick the following year, as he started 12 of 13 games, accumulating 45 receptions for 580 yards and six scores (5-71, touchdown vs Georgia in the Sugar Bowl). Hamilton was again a regular starter in 2016 (13 of 14 games) but had career lows in all categories (34-506, one touchdown) despite an excellent performance against Wisconsin the Big Ten Championship Game (8-118).

                "Player Bio": "You could say the Pettis family has some athletic prowess. Dante's father, Gary, played 11 seasons of major league baseball for four teams, winning five Gold Gloves as a centerfielder. His older cousin, Austin, was Boise State's all-time leading receiver before playing in the NFL for four seasons with the St. Louis Rams. Pettis was an all-conference high school football player at cornerback as a junior and receiver as a senior, while also playing hoops and competing at the California state track meet in the 200 meters and long jump. His athleticism got him on the field with the Huskies as a true freshman in a punt returner (28 att., 288 yards, TD) and part-time starting receiver (five starts in 13 games, 17 receptions, 259 yards, TD) role. Pettis excelled on special teams again as a sophomore, ranking fourth in the nation with 16.9 yards per punt return (16 att., 271 yards, two TD). He started eight of 13 games at receiver, as well (30 receptions, 414 yards, TD). Pettis combined with quarterback Jake Browning to explode on the national scene in 2016, displaying centerfielder-type hands as well as excellent toughness as a receiver, runner, and blocker. He ranked seventh in the FBS with 15 touchdown receptions and garnered second-team All-Pac-12 honors with 53 catches for 822 yards. His increased role on offense did not prevent him from making plays as a punt returner for the third straight season (25 att., 287 yards, two TD, ranked 10th in the FBS with 11.5 yards per return). "

Attacks high side or trail side to ruin the catch point. Smothered Christian Kirk from Texas A&M. Allowed less than 40 percent completion rate in each of the last two seasons. Head swivels and eyes dart to search for route traffic from zone. Gritty and competitive in run support. Looks to step in and stick runners with force",

FSU, Alabama, and others couldn't match Florida's push for the first-team All-State defender, however, so rooting interests were set aside. Gators coaches got Dawson on the field right away, playing him in 11 games with one start at safety as a true freshman (14 tackles, interception). He played in every game as a reserve in 2015 (10 tackles, forced fumble) before starting seven games as a nickel back (24 tackles, 3.5 for loss, one interception, led the Gators with seven pass breakups)--waiting to turn to be a full-time starter after corners Jalen Tabor and Quincy Wilson depart for the NFL. Dawson got his chance in 2017, garnering first-team All-SEC honors by starting all 11 games, collecting 34 stops, two for loss, a team-high four interceptions and nine pass breakups. His strong, compact build makes him an excellent tackler and his hand-eye coordination allows him to knock away passes at the last second. "

He did not start against South Carolina because of those drops, but got the call for the last three games of the year and exploded (23 catches for 407 yards and two scores). Moore made 29 catches for 350 yards and three touchdowns as a sophomore starter after making just two catches for 33 yards as a redshirt freshman in 2014.

Could have gadget potential as he rushed for 362 yards and three touchdowns on 8.4 yards per carry while at Pitt",

Rigid lower body restricts lateral movements. Production doesn't come close to matching the talent. His freshman season was his best. Managed just three career interceptions with limited passes broken up. Instincts and awareness from deep safety are below average. Too easily drawn out of position and suffered from mental busts.

                "Overview": "Whitehead is undersized which makes playing near the line of scrimmage a challenge and his instincts as a high safety were troubling as he allowed too many big plays. Teams may look to utilize him as a hybrid defensive back in sub packages with the ability to cover the slot and handle run support duties against teams who run the ball out of three wideout personnel groupings. Whitehead needs to run well because his lack of production will already hurt his draft cause.",

Though he was considered a top-20 cornerback prospect nationally, Pitt coaches put him at safety as a true freshman to utilize his toughness in the run game. The result was a consensus freshman All-American and third-team All-ACC season where he started 12 of 13 games played, leading the Panthers with 109 tackles, six for loss, an interception and six pass breakups. Whitehead was also used on offense (12 carries, 122 yards, two touchdowns rushing). His sophomore season wasn't quite as successful [65 tackles, 1.5 for loss, one interception (returned for a touchdown), two pass breakups] as he started just nine games, missing the final three with a broken arm. Coaches started him at receiver against Virginia but again used him as a running threat on offense (nine carries, 98 yards rushing). Whitehead's junior season began with a three-game suspension for violating team rules. He still garnered honorable mention All-ACC notice while starting nine games, however (60 tackles, one interception, four pass breakups). "

Excellent thrower of deep outs. Able to outpace safeties to deep sideline throws. Aggressive pump-fakes open double moves. Turns into competent traffic director when scrambling. Can roll right and fling it down the field with impressive velocity and placement. Asked to read the entire field. No throw is too challenging. Has arm strength and mobility to create explosive plays when play goes off-schedule. Ability to challenge safeties over the top could help running games.

Willing to pull it and move the chains with his legs. Has experience in poor weather",

May have too much hero in his blood. Tries to overcome obstacles with arm talent and makes poor decisions because of it. Takes too many chances with low percentage throws. Needs to play smarter and place higher value on the ball. Fastball pitcher whose touch could use improvement short. Will baby the deep throws at times. Field-reading is spotty. Needs to be more patient in allowing combo routes to develop. Would benefit by trading some velocity for better timing. Anticipatory throws don't seem to come naturally. Pre-snap game plan appears unfocused. Breaks from pocket without cause throwing off his timing with receivers. Doesn't keep feet \"throw-ready\" when sliding in pocket.

Allen's size and arm talent are prototypical for early first-round picks, but it's rare to find a quarterback with such a low college completion rate become a successful pro. Allen's receivers struggled to separate, but there were plenty of times where his lack of anticipation and post-snap plan did him in. Allen can make some truly special throws, but his ability to improve the mental part of his game will determine whether he's a good NFL starter or just another big, strong-armed guy.",

He signed with Reedley Community College in California for the 2014 season, throwing for 26 touchdowns and 285 yards a game (with 66 rushing yards per contest) in his lone season there. Wyoming head coach Craig Bohl saw Allen's talent, wondering if he could be another Carson Wentz, the number two overall pick for the Philadelphia Eagles who he recruited and coached at North Dakota State before moving to Laramie. Allen only got a chance to play in two games (4-of-6, 51 yards passing; 3 rushes, 40 yards) for the Cowboys in 2015, starting once, before breaking his right clavicle and taking a medical redshirt. His sophomore season, on the other hand, was healthy and productive. The Cowboys made the Mountain West Conference Championship game with his leadership in 14 starts, completing 56 percent of his passes (209-of-373) throwing for 3,203 yards and 28 touchdowns. That completion percentage and his 15 interceptions showed that his game needs to be tamed, and those concerns were only exacerbated in 2017. Allen was an honorable mention all-conference pick as a junior, but he finished 72nd in the country in passing efficiency by completing just 56.3 percent of his passes (152-of-270) for just 1,812 yards and 16 touchdowns against six interceptions. Allen struggled against Power Five foes Iowa (23-of-40, 174 yards, 2 INT) and Oregon (9-of-24, 64 yards, INT). He missed the last two regular season games with an injury to his throwing shoulder but returned for the Cowboys' bowl win over Central Michigan (11-of-19, 154 yards, 3 TDs, 0 INT).  "

                    "Weaknesses": "Way too much dancing as off-set back. Shows distrust of the blocking plan and will void the rush track early. Takes long looks for clear point of entry rather than finding the crease. Vision and decisiveness as inside runner are below average. Big runs come from bouncing wide. Run strength is average. Uses gather step pre-cut rather than plant-and-go delaying downhill burst. Long-strider for a short back. Not overly explosive on lateral jump cuts. Coming off of season-ending ankle surgery"

                "Overview": "Walton is a fluid combo back with the ability to compete for committee carries and third down snaps. His 2016 tape gives a better indication of his quickness since he was nursing an ankle injury for much of the time he played this year. His indecisiveness as an interior runner should be taken into account when offensive coordinators decide to use him. Walton has the ability to become a solid backup who can handle a heavier touch load over smaller stretches if needed.",
                "Player Bio": "Walton's father, Mark Walton, Sr., was murdered when he was young. His mother, Kimberly Rogers, passed away in March 2017. The four-star back signed with Miami to stay close to home, as he helped lead Booker T. Washington High to a state title as a senior (1,472 rush yards, 22 touchdowns). Walton led the 'Canes with 10 total touchdowns (nine rushing, one receiving) as a true freshman in 2015, rushing for 461 yards (130 carries), catching 22 passes for 293 yards, and returning 17 kickoffs for 300 yards. He earned the starting tailback job in 2016, garnering third-team All-ACC honors with 1,117 yards and 14 touchdowns on 209 carries, along with 27 receptions for 240 yards and a score. Walton's junior season was shortened by injury, however; he started the first four games of the year before a right ankle injury sidelined him. He rushed for 428 yards and three scores early in the year, and caught seven passes for 91 yards."

Not overly bendy, but uses his forward lean to play under the tackle's hands. Plays with dogged pursuit of the quarterback and secondary effort leads to sacks. Edge burst should open more inside opportunities against over-setting tackles. Rangy with tremendous speed to pursue runners to perimeter. Small but understands how and when to shift his weight to maximize his contact balance. Decent body control at point of attack. Can land first jab into blocker's frame with his length",

Has linear speed but change of direction quickness is just okay for his size. Unable to convert speed to power as rusher. Leggy and can't fight through redirect blocks. Hasn't learned to use hands as weapon in his pass rush"

While Haynes could get a trial as an early down 3-4 rush linebacker due to his pass rush potential, he isn't built to handle the physical nature of NFL run games. Haynes is a likely fit for teams looking for a designated pass rusher for sub-packages, but he'll need to become more toolsy and unpredictable as an NFL rusher if he wants to duplicate the success he had in college.",
                "Player Bio": "In April 2017, Haynes was named Ole Miss' Chucky Mullins Award winner as a defender that embodies the late defensive back's spirit and courage. Mullins was paralyzed while making a tackle in a 1989 game, and passed way two years later at the age of 21. Haynes wore Mullins' number 38 jersey this season, finishing as a second-team All-SEC selection with 45 tackles, 11 for loss, 7.5 sacks, and three forced fumbles. Many thought he would be in the NFL after the 2016 season when he led the Rebels with 11 tackles for loss among 53 total stops, seven sacks, three forced fumbles, three passes defended, and eight quarterback pressures. The tall, lean edge rusher with natural bend and hustle was a second-team All-SEC honoree as a sophomore, racking up 43 tackles, 16.5 for loss, 10 sacks, and three forced fumbles. Among Haynes' better performances that season was his four tackles, 2.5 for loss, and half-sack in the Sugar Bowl against Oklahoma State. The Jacksonville native was a Freshman All-American and SEC All-Freshman pick after starting four of 13 games played, posting 31 tackles, nine for loss, 7.5 sacks, and three forced fumbles. Haynes actually signed with North Carolina after high school but went the prep school route (Fork Union Military Academy) before going to Oxford."

He led the Knights with 57 solo tackles (had 92 total), 20 tackles for loss, and 11.5 sacks by chasing down plays with speed and wrapping his arms, while also intercepting a pass and breaking up seven others on the year. Griffin was again a first-team all-conference choice in 2017 (74 tackles, 13.5 for loss, team-high seven sacks, one interception, three pass breakups, two forced fumbles). He has played football with his \"older\" brother, Shaquill, since they were young. Shaquill came out of the womb one minute before Shaquem, and also left UCF a year earlier (drafted in the third round by Seattle in 2017) than his brother because he did not redshirt. Shaquem played in one game as a sophomore (against Penn State in Ireland), and then played 12 games on special teams and safety, making nine tackles on the year. Griffin was a second-team All-State pick in Florida as a senior, excelled in 7-on-7 teams growing up, and also could have gone to several schools on a track scholarship. "

He was a second-team All-SEC pick by league media at right guard in 2015 and received second and third-team All-American notice at that position as a junior while also picking up second-team all-conference recognition from SEC coaches. In Smith's final season, he was honored as a first-team All-American and All-SEC selection after starting all 14 games for the Tigers.

Thomas played outside for the Bulldogs this year, but those days are over. He'll need simpler routes as a tight end and has to be coached up on how best to utilize his frame to wall off defenders. A team could add Thomas with the idea of converting him to defensive end if it doesn't work out at tight end.",
                "Player Bio": "Thomas is a physical specimen that coaches found a way to get onto the field as an outside receiver in 2017 despite his 6-foot-5, 280-pound frame. The team's tight end depth forced the move, and he took advantage by catching 22 passes for 263 yards and three scores. Thomas was a reserve tight end in 2016, grabbing nine throws for 48 yards and a score, in his first year on campus. He was the No. 1 junior college tight end recruit out of East Central (Mississippi) Community College, where he contributed for two seasons (16 catches, 207 yards, three touchdowns in seven games in 2015) after being lightly recruited from Sumrall High School."

Watson was not offered scholarships by major programs (despite finishing in the top five in state history in receiving yards and touchdowns) until he committed to Penn, and he stuck with the Quakers even after ACC and Big Ten schools came calling. As a freshman, Watson contributed heavily in a reserve role (42 catches, 497 yards, two touchdowns in 10 games). He was a first-team All-Ivy League selection in 2015, finishing as runner-up for the conference's Offensive Player of the Year award (74 catches, 1,082 yards, nine touchdowns receiving; 10 carries, 154 yards, one touchdown rushing). Watson's play started to be noticed on a national level in 2016, as he was named a finalist for the Walter Payton Award as the FCS's top player. He set school records with 89 receptions for 1,115 yards while scoring eight times (23 carries, 133 rushing yards). The Quakers also won the Ivy League title for the second time in three years with Watson on the squad. Not surprisingly, Watson excelled as a senior, again becoming a finalist for the Walter Payton Award, as well as a first-team AP FCS All-American and first-team All-Ivy League selection. He caught 81 passes for 1,083 yards and 14 touchdowns in 10 games."

Throws with excessively narrow base and stiff front side. Flips it rather than throws it. Makes targets work too hard. Sails throws that can end up in hands of a safety. At times, hesitates to challenge safeties in the seam. Low release point leads to tipped passes. Typically gets through reads 1 and 2 before halting progressions. Pocket awareness has room for improvement. Move accuracy on rollouts and scrambles is poor. Highly inaccurate with throws on the move throughout the 2017 season.

Jackson may need to operate in an offense ready to integrate RPOs (run/pass options) along with heavy play-action. Like Deshaun Watson in 2017, Jackson has the ability to counter mental mistakes and turnovers with a high number of explosive, touchdown-making plays. He has star potential, but his success will rest heavily upon his ability to stay healthy.",
                "Player Bio": "In a time where some players (and their parents) seek the limelight above all else, Jackson and his family have stayed away from the distractions. Jackson's father, Lamar, Sr., passed away in a car accident when Lamar was young, but even throughout the Heisman Trophy-winning 2016 season, Lamar and his mother, Felicia Jones, limited their media exposure. Of course, Jackson got plenty of exposure during his sophomore season, not only winning the Heisman but also Davey O'Brien and Maxwell Awards, as well as the ACC Player of the Year. Jackson's vision and speed as a runner helped him set a school record with 1,571 rushing yards (ranked 10th in the FBS) and 21 touchdowns on 260 carries. His cannon arm helped him pass for 3,543 yards (230-of-409, 56.2 completion percentage) for 30 touchdowns against nine interceptions. Jackson struggled throwing in the team's final three games, all losses (48 completion percentage, three touchdowns, three interceptions). Jackson played well in his junior season, as well, finishing third in the Heisman voting and earning second-team AP All-American, ACC Offensive Player of the Year, and first-team all-conference honors. He completed 59.1 percent of his passes (254-of-430) for 3,660 yards, 27 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions (four in the team's bowl loss to Mississippi State). Jackson also ran for 1,601 yards and 18 touchdowns (both in the top 10 nationally) on 232 carries, while finishing atop the FCS with 405 yards of total offense per game. In his first season with the Cardinals, Jackson started nine of 12 games (once at running back, against Auburn). His performance against Texas A&M in the Music City Bowl at the end of the year portended his future play, as he ran and threw for over 200 yards on his way to Most Valuable Player honors."

Has 20 interceptions over last 20 games. Decision-making and field vision were inconsistent this year. Has a tendency to rush throws once internal clock winds down. Too much mustard on some short throws. Muscles too many throws rather than driving with lower half. Too willing to throw from uneven platform. Intermediate accuracy fell from 2016.

Rosen has the pocket poise, accuracy and intelligence to become a good NFL starter, but he needs to be willing to take what defenses give him more frequently. Rosen will need to quell concerns surrounding leadership and coachability early on in order to establish a strong first impression and get his career off on the right foot.",
                "Player Bio": "One of the top recruits of the 2015 class, Rosen decided to stay close to home to play his ball in Westwood. He was a first-team USA Today All-American as a high school senior, throwing for 3,186 yards and 29 touchdowns while his St. John Bosco squad won the California State Championship. UCLA coaches saw enough of his talent in the spring of 2015 (he graduated from high school one semester early) that they made him the first Bruin freshman opening-weekend starter ever. He won Pac-12 Freshman of the Year and several Freshman All-American honors after setting several school records and completing 60 percent (292-487) of his passes for 3,668  yards and 23 touchdowns (11 interceptions). Despite being only a freshman, he was in command of the offense and used his NFL size and arm to sling the ball all over the field. Rosen's sophomore season had its peaks (400 passing yards against Arizona State) and valleys (three interceptions vs. Texas A&M), and eventually ended with a season-ending injury to his throwing shoulder after six starts (59.3 completion percentage, 1,915 yards, 10 touchdowns, five interceptions). The surgery to his shoulder was not considered major, so he was throwing effectively in spring 2017 practices. Rosen had the performance of the year in the season's opening weekend, leading the Bruins in an amazing 45-44 comeback win with 491 passing yards and four touchdowns. He struggled over a four-game stretch at the start of the Pac-12 season, throwing eight of his 10 interceptions on the year. He did earn second-team All-Pac-12 notice, however, by completing 62.6 percent of his passes (283-452), throwing 26 touchdowns, and ranking second in the country with 341.5 passing yards a game (3,756 total). Rosen also suffered two concussions during the year, missing one regular season contest and their bowl game against Kansas State."

Disrupts route release with long jabs into receiver's frame from press. Easy to open and sprint against vertical threats. Has tools and trigger to stalk and challenge routes underneath from off-man.

His uncle, Damon Mays, also played college ball (receiver at Missouri) and in the NFL. Scouts are high on Isaiah's pro promise due to his size and tenacious nature. He also received the athleticism genes, starring in high school football (27 yards per reception, 12 touchdowns, seven interceptions, nine blocked punts as a senior) and track (state champ in 110 and 300-meter hurdles, 4x400 relay) in Arizona. Oliver made a splash as a true freshman, playing in all 13 games and starting three (19 tackles, six pass breakups). While he only started twice in 2016 behind 2017 NFL Draft pick Ahkello Witherspoon, he made 25 tackles, intercepted a pass, and broke up 13 passes. He also returned punts the second half of the season (14 returns, 164 yards, one touchdown). Oliver became a star in his own right in his junior year, garnering first-team All-Pac-12 honors with 27 tackles, two interceptions, and 13 pass breakups despite missing time with a leg injury. Oliver participated on the Buffaloes' track squad as a freshman, finishing seventh in the Pac-12 conference meet as a decathlete."

Uses big burst for recovery and closeouts. Carries true long speed down the field. Reads clues from off-man. Reads slants and drives in front of the route in search of an interception. Allowed just over 32 percent completions over last two years. Ballhawk with sudden hands to attack the throw. Bats throws down and will swirl arms around the catch point to prevent target from finishing the catch",

Appears to avoid route contact so he doesn't upset coverage balance. Physical receivers can body him around at the top of the route. Needs to turn and find football sooner with back to the ball. Always around the throw, but lack of size and length shows up with \"just misses\" in pass defense. Several pass breakups came on throws with poor placement.

Ward proved his coach correct, earning first-team All-American and all-conference accolades in 2017 with 37 tackles, two for loss, two interceptions, and 15 pass breakups (ranked in the top 10 in the nation). He earned honorable mention All-Big Ten notice from league media as a non-starter in 2016, playing 30 snaps a game on defense. Ward tied Lattimore for the team lead with nine pass breakups on the year (23 tackles), never giving up on a play and being quite physical despite his average size for the position. Ward got onto the field as a true freshman, making seven tackles, primarily on special teams. Ward was a first-team All-Ohio pick and Division II Co-Defensive Player of the Year as a high school senior (nine interceptions, 18 pass breakups).

Edmunds, who is tall and long for a stack linebacker, attacked open lanes to become a second-team All-ACC pick in 2016, starting 14 times and compiling 106 tackles, 18.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks. He had an interception in the team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Belk Bowl appearance against Arkansas. NFL scouts loved what they saw from Edmunds as a junior, as did the Associated Press, who named him third-team All-American. He was also a first-team All-ACC selection in 2017, recording a team-high 109 tackles, 14 tackles for loss, 5.5 sacks, and three forced fumbles."

Eyeballs and eliminates safeties to isolate man coverage on his receiver. Quick processor from read to read. Responds suddenly to what is there. Pitch and catch accurate if you allow it. Underrated arm talent. Expedite from off-platform with tight release and zip. Drives with lower body for added velocity. Accurate on all three levels.

Deep balls hang on him. Can't afford any delay in deep release to beat safety over the top. Needs to eliminate his back foot throws. Desire to make plays will lead to unnecessary sacks.

Mayfield completed 70.5 percent of his passes (285-of-404), throwing 43 touchdowns against just six interceptions (also rushing for 311 yards and five scores). The Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year led the nation in pass efficiency by a large margin (setting a NCAA record that he himself set the previous year) and yards per pass attempt (11.8), and finished in the top five of pretty much every other passing category. He was an all-state pick from Texas, but his lack of size scared major college programs away. He began his college days in Lubbock, walking on at Texas Tech. In his one and only season there, Mayfield started seven of eight games played, winning Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year (218-of-340, 64.1 percent complete, 2,315 yards, 12 touchdowns, nine interceptions). Tech head coach Kliff Kingsbury decided to open up the starting competition, so Mayfield left campus to find a new home. He sat out the 2014 season as a transfer student to Oklahoma (eventually, Big 12 coaches approved a rule that gave Mayfield an extra year of eligibility to make up for the lost season, as he was a walk-on that never received a scholarship offer from Tech). Finally on the field as the No. 1 starter in 2015, Mayfield became a second-team Associated Press All-American, Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year, finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting, and was a finalist for the Davey O'Brien, Manning, and Walter Camp Player of the Year Awards. He also won the Burlsworth Trophy as the nation's top player who began his career as a walk-on after completing 68.1 percent of his passes (269-of-395) for 3,700 yards and 36 touchdowns against just seven interceptions. In addition to winning Burlsworth Trophy again in 2016, Mayfield was first-team All-Big 12, finished third in Heisman voting, and was a finalist for the Maxwell and Davey O'Brien Awards after leading the FBS in passing efficiency (196.4 rating, ranked first with 70.9 completion percentage, 3,965 yards, 40 touchdowns, eight interceptions). While his completion percentage was aided by horizontal throws, his mobility helped him find secondary targets and his ability to throw passes over the top of defenses also led him to lead the FBS with 11.1 yards per attempt. Mayfield was arrested for public intoxication, disorderly conduct, and fleeing/resisting arrest in February 2017. He was not suspended for those actions, though he was required to participate in alcohol education classes and community service.  "

Two-gaps with arm extension and his eyes in the backfield. Offenses simply shouldn't run at him. Eats blocks and keeps linebackers clean. Has to be schemed against. Hands and feet are full synced. Gifted athlete who showed marked improvement as rusher. Increased pressures from 15 to 27 this year. Fluid mover with above-average range to chase. Utilizes slap/arm-over to work around blocker's edge. Can walk interior linemen back into pocket with bullrush. Considered one of the most respected leaders during Saban era",
                    "Weaknesses": "Doesn't come off the snap with much juice and will pop up a little tall. Has athletic ability but is more of a phone booth defender than down-the-line tackler. Square-up player with average change of direction or ability to get the upper body turn to climb over and around the top. Pass rush can come to a grinding halt if his first move is stopped. Ability to play on rush downs could be the difference between first and second"

                "Overview": "Payne possesses one of the most impressive combinations of strength and athleticism that we've seen from an interior lineman. He will be the premier run-stuffer in this draft, but he may have enough in the pass rushing toolbox to project as a better pro than college pass rusher. Payne is a game-ready starter who immediately upgrades a defense's ability to slow the run. If teams view him as just a run-down player, then his draft value could fall a little, but he could become a Pro Bowl defender early in his career.",
                "Player Bio": "Payne came to Alabama as a 350-pound behemoth who was a top 20 national high school recruit, but for his senior year played closer to 300 while still keeping his elite strength to move back the center and shed the block to make plays. With Jonathan Allen in the pros, Payne took over as the playmaker inside, earning second-team All-SEC honors (53 tackles, one sack, one interception, three pass break-ups). Payne saved his best for last, dominating inside against Georgia in the national championship game. He was a 15-game starter as a sophomore in 2016, making 36 tackles, 3.5 for loss, and 1.5 sacks from the nose guard position. Payne started three games in the middle as a true freshman in 2015, stopping the ball 13 times with half a tackle for loss."

Can peek-a-boo either gap to follow the runner. Background as scrambler in wrestling makes it hard for offensive linemen to finish their blocks against him. Active and determined. Able to drive upfield through angle blocks and alter the run lane. Uses basic but effective spin move to disengage from clutter. Pocket pusher who can force quarterback to move his feet.

Add in the play he's put on tape over the past couple of seasons and it was no surprise when he decided to leave school early for the NFL. Phillips played in six games as a reserve in his first year on the Farm (nine tackles, two sacks). He missed all but one game of the 2015 season, unfortunately, because of a knee injury suffered in the season opener. The following year, Phillips garnered honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors after starting 12 games, making 46 stops, 9.5 for loss, and 6.5 sacks. Amazingly, he led Stanford in tackles (103, 17 for loss, 7.5 sacks, as well as two forced fumbles) from the interior as a junior in 2017, which led the Associated Press to vote him third-team All-American. Phillips was also first-team all-conference and named a member of the America Football Coaches Association Good Works Team."

Closing burst increases ball production. Has traits and cover ability to play outside or in slot. Closes out separation from breaks very quickly. Has ability to bait quarterbacks into interceptions.

He became a star in 2016, starting all 13 games at tight end and setting school records at the position for receptions (48) and yards (616) by consistently nabbing everything thrown his way and outmuscling defenders downfield (he scored one touchdown as well). Hurst was the first sophomore in USC history to be a team captain, albeit as a 23 year-old. The following year, he earned first-team All-SEC recognition by catching 44 passes for 559 yards and two touchdowns. Hurst had Tommy John surgery as an eighth-grader. "

Now he's looking to become a star in 2017; in fact, in February Evans tweeted that he would win the Butkus Award as the nation's top linebacker. After sitting behind future pros like Reuben Foster for three years, he was ready to meet that promise. Evans was a second-team All-SEC pick in 2017, starting 12 games, tying for the team lead with 74 tackles, leading the team with 13 tackles for loss, making six sacks, and breaking up three passes. In the team's two playoff games in 2016 (his only starts of the year), Evans made 18 tackles from an inside linebacker position. He had 53 total for the year, including four sacks, six quarterback hurries, and a forced fumble in 14 games. Evans had to bide his time like many highly-recruited players coming to play for Nick Saban. The Parade All-American and five-star prospect actually played significantly as a true freshman on special teams in 13 games (15 tackles, two for loss, sack; team-leading 12 special teams tackles). Evans again mostly played as a special teamer and reserve outside linebacker in 2015, though his two sacks against Clemson in the national championship victory that season put him on scouts' radars.

Key took some time away from the program during the spring of 2017 for personal reasons but returned in the summer. He had shoulder surgery in the offseason, however, which caused him to miss the Tigers' first two games. Key also missed time with a finger injury, which meant he only started eight games on the year. He finished with 33 tackles, 5.5 for loss, four sacks, and a forced fumble."

Compact with explosive power. Has a 700-pound squat to his name. Quick off the snap with early hands. Sharp upward thrust into blocker establishes leverage. Owned point of attack against his competition. Able to brace up against double teams. Equally powerful with upper and lower body. Athletic and rangy as tackler. Drives under and through the guard's edge. Corners tightly to quarterback once he's in the pocket. Able to push pocket as bull rusher. Eyeballs quarterback and mirrors his scramble for secondary sacks. His 14 career blocked kicks is unheard of. Staggering pro day numbers included a 38\" vertical, 36 lifts and a sub 4.8 forty",

Additional weight appeared to impact conditioning and fatigue levels. Faced very few opponents who could match his strength on FCS level.

Hall has the quickness and strength to be disruptive against the run and pass as a shade nose or reduced front three-technique. His level of production in every category imaginable could foreshadow his ability to translate into the NFL, but he will have to prove he can maintain his weight and stand up to the rigors of the interior with bigger men across from him.",

The two-time first-team Associated Press FCS All-American played defensive tackle as a senior, however, garnering first-team All-Southland Conference honors by racking up 60 tackles, 19 for loss, six sacks, six pass breakups, and tying for the FCS lead with four blocked kicks. Hall was the 2016 Southland Conference Defensive Player of the Year and a finalist for the Buck Buchanan Award as the top defender in the old Division 1AA after racking up 24.5 tackles for loss and 13 sacks among his 56 total stops (along with three forced fumbles) in 13 starts. Hall was a third-team AP All-American pick and first-team All-Southland selection as a sophomore, leading the Kats with 75 tackles, 22 for loss and 11 sacks. He also blocked five kicks on the year, the second straight season he accomplished that feat. In his redshirt freshman season, Hall started his assault on the record books with a third-team AP All-American and first-team all-conference season. He finished third in Jerry Rice Award voting (top freshman in the FCS) after recording 30 tackles for loss and 12 sacks among his 93 stops, as well as forcing four fumbles."

Has a gift for playing past kick return blocks and maintaining focus on the returner. Technically sound as tackler. Sees what he hits and drives upper body into target while wrapping to finish. Possesses agility for lateral tackles against cutback runs. Hustles to contain against perimeter runs. Offers versatility. Played near the line and matched up on slot targets. Redirects routes with force. Reads and squeezes from zone. Finished 2017 with seven passes defensed including two pick-six interceptions",
                    "Weaknesses": "Just one season as starter. Has the frame of a big safety, but is an average athlete in space. Is a little sluggish in his directional change and needs a runway to get accelerate to top speed. Pursuit speed is below par. Often blocked by smaller slot players against spread rushing attacks.

One of the top outside linebacker recruits in the nation after an excellent high school career in the Washington, D.C. metro area (all-state in Maryland with 1,307 rushing yards, 18 touchdowns as senior, 16.5 tackles for loss, five sacks as junior). O'Daniel redshirted in 2013, and then got into the action regularly as a freshman, starting once and leading the team with 13 special teams tackles (had 31 total stops, sack) in 12 games played. He once again paced the team with 19 special teams stops in 2015, and was credited with 32 total tackles in 15 games as a reserve. Given a chance to play more on defense as a junior (10 starts in 15 games), O'Daniel used his quickness and tenacious nature to make 60 stops, 10 for loss, and 2.5 sacks. "

Benefitted from loads of hitch throws and comebacks. Missing jets to climb past coverage and separate. Physical corners crowd him against the boundary on outside release. Route speed is dull. Lacks separation acceleration out of short and intermediate breaks. Needs to use big frame to shield catch point. Inconsistent finisher on tightly-contested catches.

                "Overview": "Despite a low completion percentage and high interception total at Tulane, there was a buzz surrounding Lee when he opened the season as the starter at Nebraska. In his season at Nebraska, it was the same story with Lee struggling to decipher moving pieces effectively resulting in the same issues he had previously. Lee has a shot of getting drafted and making a practice squad on his traits alone, but his issues with processing and anticipation probably can't be corrected.",
                "Player Bio": "Lee began his collegiate career at Tulane after completing his high school career in nearby Destrehan, Louisiana as an honorable mention all-state selection. After redshirting in 2013, Lee set freshman passing records for the Green Wave after starting 10 contests, completing 55 percent of his passes (185-336) for 1,962 yards and 12 touchdowns against 14 interceptions. He started nine games the following year, completing 52 percent of his throws (143-276) for 1,639 yards and 11 touchdowns (he cut the interceptions to seven). Lee transferred from Tulane to Nebraska before the 2016 season, partially because of the beating he took in New Orleans (concussion, shoulder separation, broken finger). He was the Huskers' Scout Team Offensive MVP that year, and then took the reins of the Nebrasks offense in 2017. Lee started all 12 games this fall, completing 57.5 percent of his throws (246-428) for 3,143 yards and 23 touchdowns. He also threw 16 interceptions on the year, however. Lee's grandfather, Jimmy, played football at Alabama. His father, Phillip, played football and baseball at Troy State, then later went to UAB to play baseball."

Winning combination of speed, power and balance. Good recognition of early trouble from penetration and makes alterations. Has quality vision and is able to make sudden cuts without rolling into low gear. Rarely rushes as interior runner. Sets up blocks and follows the plan. Gathers weight quickly after cuts and re-establishes his base. Exceptional contact balance carrying power to punish second-level tacklers. Can create his own fortune. Has footwork and athleticism to spin out of tackle attempts. Able to push piles. Shows ability to impose his will in the fourth quarter. Angle tackles won't get it done. Possesses homerun capability when he finds open field. Not a classic third-down back, but can pick up patches of yards out of backfield",

Will opt to finish rather than spying additional opportunities at times. Has some hip tightness and needs additional room to elude tacklers when rolling downhill. Takes his fair share of heavy hits.

                "Overview": "Evaluating Guice requires settling in for two full seasons of tape study as he was only healthy a fraction of the 2017 season. While Guice has some elusiveness and long speed, much of his success comes from his furious running style and ability to create yardage after contact. Guice's yards per touch was two yards higher over his first two seasons compared to last year. Like Leonard Fournette the year before, teams may be willing to lock in on his sophomore tape to create their evaluations and grades. Guice's running style could lead to a shorter career, but he has a chance to make a big splash early.",
                "Player Bio": "In most cases, it would be tough for a team to lose an excellent backfield talent like Leonard Fournette. Fournette's injuries in 2016, however, gave Guice the opportunity to prove he could handle the starting job. He used his exceptional balance, violent running style, and speed to lead the SEC in rushing (1,387 yards) and rushing touchdowns for running backs (15) despite starting just six of 12 games played. The first-team All-SEC pick set a school record with 285 yards against Texas A&M and ranked fifth in the country with 7.6 yards per attempt on the year. He was named MVP of the Citrus Bowl with 138 yards and a score in the win over Louisville. Guice was banged-up himself early in the 2017 season, but managed to start 11 of 12 games played, receiving second-team All-SEC notice after rushing for 1,251 yards and 11 touchdowns on 237 carries (18 receptions, 124 yards, two touchdowns receiving). The five-star prospect from Baton Rouge (all-state pick with 1,341 rushing yards, 21 touchdowns, 617 receiving yards as a senior) plays with anger stored in his body since his father was murdered when he was seven. He played in every game as a true freshman in 2015, averaging 8.5 yards on 51 carries and scoring three times when Fournette was unavailable. Guice has produced as a kick returner in his two years with the Tigers, gaining 472 yards on 20 attempts in 2015 and 223 yards on 11 tries in 2016. "

Alexander played in 12 games, with one start on defense (19 tackles, one interception) in his true freshman season. He's also made a name for himself as a punt returner in his first two seasons (29 returns for 223 yards in 2015, 19 returns for 195 yards in 2016), including a 69-yard return for a touchdown against ACC rival Florida State in 2016. Alexander missed about half of the 2017 season with leg and hand injuries, but managed to start six of seven games played on the year (19 tackles, one interception, four pass breakups) and was named honorable mention All-ACC.

Harrison started every game as a sophomore in 2016, making 86 tackles, intercepting two passes and breaking up seven others. He also tied for the team lead with eight special teams tackles, which was no surprise given his length, speed, and hard-hitting nature.

                    "Strengths": "Well-built with NFL-caliber frame and good overall arm length. Good football intelligence. Quarterback of the secondary who works hard on the tape and gets his defense lined up. Plays with downhill mindset. Quality trigger after diagnosing hitch throws or running plays. Often activated as an additional linebacker. Had 8.5 tackles for loss in 2017. Embraces physicality of the position. Won't pass up a chance to make a statement with a big hit. Forced three fumbles in 2017. Decent tackle finisher for being tight-hipped. Had six interceptions this year and nine total over just 26 games",
                    "Weaknesses": "Tight-hipped and noticeably segmented in his movements in space. Needs to play with better knee bend. Short-strider and severely duck-footed. Change of direction is labored with feet barely leaving the ground with his lateral movements. Can be passive in squeezing and attacking dig routes in front of his face. Interceptions fell right into his lap this year. Overall body adjustments to challenge the throw are below average. Will struggle to pace with route breaks in man coverage"

His draft stock will be tied heavily to his Combine workout.",

He tried for fourth nationally with six interceptions, returning two for touchdowns. The 12-game starter also totaled 63 tackles, 8.5 for loss, nine pass breakups, and three forced fumbles. Elliott started one game of 12 played as a sophomore, compiling 30 tackles, three for loss, an interception, and four pass breakups. In 2015, the former Under Armour All-American and all-state defensive back from Texas played in seven games on defense and special teams (13 tackles, two interceptions, one pass breakups, one forced fumble) despite missing time with an injury."

Ability to sustain and finish. Improves positioning after contact and can generate some movement at point of attack without a double team. Gave it to USC's Rasheem Green on more than a couple of snaps when matched head to head. Sinks hips into breaks. Opens sharply on underneath routes to look for the throw. Has good feel for attacking the voids against zone coverage. Will shut routes down early to keep throwing window open for quarterback. Physical in creating space at top of his routes. Short area footwork is adequate. Has ability to become a reliable target over the middle and in traffic",
                    "Weaknesses": "Receiving production has been underwhelming throughout his career. Routes can be monotonous and predictable. Allows too much leeway for defenders to play the catch point. Needs to play bigger in space and use his frame. Lacks speed to attack over top. Struggles to separate against man coverage on intermediate routes. Could have somewhat limited workspace as NFL pass catcher. Not as physical after the catch. Slows feet into contact and won't always fall forward. Strikes first, but will lose initial hand placement when long defenders get into him.

While his frame could still use more mass, he plays with good technique and play strength at the point of attack and shows an ability to impose his will upon edge defenders if they half-step into the rep. Schultz is a capable and reliable target underneath, but his living will depend on how he impacts the running game. Schultz's limited catch production could drop him a round, but he should be a solid, early starter.",
                "Player Bio": "Stanford has become a hotspot for tight ends, and Schultz is the next one in line with an NFL future. Head coach David Shaw called him the most \"complete\" tight end the team has had in recent years, as his height and hands make him a nice target over the middle, and he's growing into a solid in-line blocker. The four-star/top-100 recruit from Utah (31 receptions, 512 yards, nine touchdowns as senior) sat out the 2014 season as the Cardinal had a deep roster at the position. Schultz played in 14 games the next season, catching 10 passes for 121 yards and a score. He was an honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick in 2016, grabbing 23 receptions for 222 yards and one touchdown. Schultz left Stanford for the NFL after a junior season that saw him gain first-team all-conference accolades by blocking for star back Bryce Love and nabbing 22 throws for 212 yards and three scores."

Makes subtle weight shifts to keep defender centered during his block. Stays connected to his blocks for the long haul. Plays with adequate lift and hip roll at point of attack. Fires out of his stance into initial kick-slide. Has ability to slide and mirror defender around the arc when technique is right. Nimble feet and good reactive athleticism to recover when beaten around the edge. Quality \"snap and find\" talent on End/Tackle twists",
                    "Weaknesses": "Linear build lacking core strength. Technique will go on vacation at inopportune times. Struggled during Senior Bowl reps to maintain his pass pro posture. Tends to defaults to a \"nose-over-toes\" approach with too much waist-bending. Hands take too many outside tracks to the target. More grabber than puncher. Oversets and opens the inside path. Lack of play strength could be debilitating on the next level. Panics and forgets his footwork. Gets caught on balls of his feet and can be walked into pocket in pass pro. Makes initial contact before working his feet into position as lateral blocker. Doesn't have enough upper body strength to seal and finish some backside reach blocks. Allows defenders to rip through his edge"

                "Overview": "O'Neill has good length and is a terrific athlete, but his inconsistencies at the Senior Bowl practices will be hard for teams to get out of their minds. What might be even more troubling is the way he seemed to panic and lose technique in certain matchups. O'Neill is a classic zone scheme blocker, but teams may take a look at him as a move guard with tackle potential rather than locking in with him as a blind-side tackle. O'Neill needs to get thicker and stronger or swing tackle could be his ceiling.",
                "Player Bio": "O'Neill's athleticism helped him win honors as Delaware High School Defensive Player of the Year (five sacks, 13 pass deflections, also 33 receptions, 614 yards, and eight touchdowns as a tight end) in football and the state's basketball Player of the Year award. His talent came as no surprise since his father was a running back at Dartmouth and his mother a swimmer at Northeastern University. O'Neill was a tight end during his redshirt season in 2014 and the following spring but moved over to offensive tackle before the 2015 season. He played in all 13 games, starting the final 12 (one at left tackle, the rest at right tackle). O'Neill continued his improvement on the line, starting all 13 games at right tackle and earning second-team All-ACC from league coaches. Injuries on the line caused him to move to left tackle for his junior season, where he started all 12 games and garnered first-team all-conference honors. Pitt coaches used O'Neill' athleticism as an offensive weapon as a rusher (two scores, one on a lateral and the other on an end-around) and passer (0-for-2). He won the satirical \"Piesman Trophy\" in 2016 for one of his touchdowns."

Searches for incoming throws once receiver makes his break. Tremendously disruptive. Plays high or low side of the route and attacks the throw with relentless timing and aggression. Had double-digit passes defensed in each of his three seasons. Hands are like garden rakes dragging the football away from the receiver. Extremely difficult to feather touch throws over him downfield. Has experience guarding extremely athletic and talented targets in the SEC",

Off-man can be a struggle. Transitions are spotty unless he reads the pattern. Sometimes stumbles and loses balance checking complex routes. Unable to mirror and match from a backpedal. Extremely grabby at the top of the route. Tugs on jerseys as recovery tactic. Six pass interference penalties in 2017. Opportunistic angles on the throw leave him susceptible to big plays when he misses. Takes inconsistent angles as tackler. Needs more fundamental strike and wrap approach"

In 2015, Davis was a Freshman All-SEC selection, starting nine of 13 games, making 56 tackles, two for loss, while leading the team with three interceptions and breaking up eight others. He played through injuries as a sophomore, starting 10 of 12 games played and breaking up 10 passes (46 stops, two for loss). Davis was a first-team All-SEC pick in 2017, starting 13 games, making 36 stops, intercepting one pass, and leading the Tigers with 11 pass breakups.

Adequate explosion into fits and runs feet through contact. Will generate push when he keeps block centered. Has vision to second level. Enough agility to work hips into position on move blocks. Recognizes downhill linebackers and comes off doubles to splatter him. Stiff jab in his pass punch. Lands with heavy hands and locks it out. Features size and anchor to combat and absorb power rushers. Can redirect and recover to protect the pocket. Held up well at Senior Bowl in one-on-ones. College tackle with foot quickness to mirror athletic rushers",

Demby may be more solid than good as a run blocker, but his experience at tackle and his traits in pass protection could help him stand out for a pass-heavy offense looking to shore up a leaky interior. Demby has the traits and talent to become an eventual starter.",

He missed the 2016 season opener with a strained PCL but returned to play in 10 games, starting nine at his left tackle spot. In his final season, Demby was a preseason CAA All-Conference selection and a third-team FCS All-American before going on to play in all 10 of the team's games.

Has shown ability to handle complex routes. Plays with consistent pace through route breaks to optimize separation in tight spaces. Has learned to catch defenders on his hip and keep them there through the catch. A quarterback's friend with ability to drop and save the low throw as well as secure contested catches in traffic. Has footwork and athleticism to make tacklers miss. Averaged 15.8 yards per catch for his career",

Urgent to rush into his run fit and do his job. Adequate force as a striker. High school sprinter with decent straight-line speed. Has footwork and enough agility to survive and recover when crossed up by route fakes. History of special teams performance will help. Was MVP of the NFLPA game",

Takes questionable angles to throws. Needs to take a stand and squeeze a route near goal line rather than guarding grass. May lack lateral agility to handle man coverage responsibilities in NFL. Missed tackles plague him. Will undershoot pursuit angles to the perimeter and is inconsistent striking from a balance posture"

With just one year as a full-time starter, there simply isn't enough impressive tape to get excited about. He has decent size and could put together a solid workout, but may not offer enough range in coverage or thump as a tackler to ever be a full-time contributor. Apke may need to find his niche on special teams to earn any early playing time.",

His son, Troy, took a different path, signing with Penn State as a first-team all-state receiver from Mount Lebanon. He moved to safety for the Nittany Lions, playing in six games as a reserve (two tackles) as a true freshman. Apka started one game in his sophomore and junior seasons, compiling 26 and 28 tackles respectively and intercepting one pass in 2016. He joined fellow senior Marcus Allen as a starter (11 times in 13 games played) during 2017, posting 55 stops, three for losses, an interception and five pass breakups."

The son of former Pro Bowl tight end Ferrell Edmunds proved his own acumen as an all-state running back in Virginia (1,753 rushing yards, 25 touchdowns as a senior). Most recruiting services listed him as a cornerback, however, so the Hokies played him on the scout team at that position in 2014. Edmunds moved to Rover the next season, starting eight of 13 games played and posting 34 tackles, 1.5 for loss. He broke out as an honorable mention All-ACC selection in 2016, starting 13 of 14 games played and recording 89 tackles, 2.5 for loss, and four interceptions (one coming against Arkansas in the Belk Bowl). With an eye towards his future, Edmunds wisely shut down his junior season after 10 starts to have surgery on his left shoulder. He still garnered third-team All-ACC recognition while playing through the pain early in the year, making 59 stops, 2.5 for loss, intercepting two passes, and breaking up four others. "

He was a two-time All-District pick, however, and received interest from SFA to earn a scholarship. Franklin played in eight games as a reserve in 2014 (11 tackles, one for loss) and then took over a starring role on defense. He was a second-team All-Southland Conference pick in 2015, starting four of 11 games, posting 32 tackles, 8.5 for loss, and six sacks (three coming against Southeastern Louisiana). Franklin was first-team all-conference in 2016, leading the Lumberjacks with 14.5 tackles for loss (32 total stops) and eight sacks and also ranking eighth in the FCS with four forced fumbles. He completed his career as a second-team all-conference selection in 2017, starting 10 of 11 games and again leading his squad with 13.5 tackles for loss (55 total) and 3.5 sacks."

In 15 games as a reserve, Cain averaged 19.1 yards on his 38 receptions (724 yards in total) and scored nine times using his speed, vertical, and learning from teammate Mike Williams on how to create separation at the top of his route. He caught five passes for 94 yards in Clemson's title game victory over Alabama. Cain garnered third-team All-ACC honors as a junior, leading the Tigers with 659 receiving yards and six touchdowns on 52 receptions for the ACC champions.

He faced a sexual assault trial between his freshman and sophomore year but was cleared of those charges before the 2016 season by admitting during the hearing he was \"so stoned\" he did not want to have sex with anyone. He was also cited for marijuana possession in May 2017 as a passenger in a car stopped because the driver wasn't wearing his seat belt; he pled no contest to possession of paraphernalia in July 2017.

Active as tackler to search for and yank at the football. Forced and recovered six career fumbles. Has edge-threatening get-off. Uses slinky upper body to slide around blocker's punch. Flashes talent to flip hips around the arc and flatten to the quarterback. Posted 15 career sacks",

Not ready to handle downhill rushing attack headed for his doorstep. Herd tackler with just moderate solo numbers. More of a straight-line mover than expected. Rush can be too easily stalled when rushing as an end. Slow to activate hands as a pass rusher. Will need to develop rush plan and hand usage to counter his lack of play strength. Not enough boom for conversion of speed to power"

                "Overview": "Carter was a five-star prospect and one of the most heralded players in the nation when he was recruited by Georgia but he never made the impact expected of him as a Bulldog. However, Carter played with increased toughness and confidence this year and his NFL potential began to reassert itself once again. Carter is an outside linebacker in a 3-4 or 4-3 with sideline-to-sideline range and the tools to become a productive edge rusher in sub-packages. He needs to add more bulk, but he is a future NFL starter.",
                "Player Bio": "Before Georgia's Liberty Bowl matchup against TCU in December 2016, head coach Kirby Smart challenged Carter and others to step up their games. The long, lean rush linebacker with excellent straight-line speed responded with seven tackles and two forced fumbles in the win, showing the playmaking ability scouts expected to see. Carter had been productive in his junior season (44 tackles, five sacks, 13 pressures in 13 games, with nine starts), but much more had been expected of him since arriving between the hedges. He came through with a second-team All-SEC senior campaign, starting 10 of 15 games played, making 61 tackles, 7.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks, and a team-high three forced fumbles while often playing off the line of scrimmage. Carter was ranked as high as the second-best recruit in the country, and Georgia fans are thrilled to see the Norcross native (he led the team to a state title with 132 tackles, 40 for loss, six sacks as a senior) staying in-state. He was the team's Newcomer of the Year in his first year on campus, starting five of 13 games played, making 41 tackles, seven for loss, and 4.5 sacks. Carter had an impressive Belk Bowl performance against Louisville that year, with eight tackles and a sack. His sophomore numbers dropped, however, as he started just two of 13 games and had just 19 tackles on the year."

                "Player Bio": "Sam was coming off an excellent sophomore year when lining up for the first game of the 2016 season. Unfortunately, a foot injury suffered in that contest shut down his campaign after just one tackle. He rehabbed that injury and returned to garner honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors in 2017, leading the Sun Devils with 127 tackles, 9.5 for loss, three sacks, and two pass breakups. That sophomore season saw Sam compile 98 tackles, 6.5 for loss, an interception, and two pass breakups in 13 starts. Sam started at Allen High School for two straight state titles and was a top-30 linebacker recruit when signing with ASU. He played in 12 games as a reserve, making 16 tackles, one for loss, an interception, and one pass breakup."

His sophomore season was even better, covering 1,625 yards and scoring 12 times while again garnering first-team all-conference honors (38 carries, 339 yards and four touchdowns rushing). James was also the Hawai'i Bowl MVP despite the Blue Raiders' loss because of his 201 yards of offense (162 receiving, 39 rushing) and 51-yard touchdown. His junior season was cut short in October 2017 because of a broken collarbone (31 receptions, 290 yards, three receiving touchdowns; 10 carries, 57 yards rushing, seven attempts and 37 yards on punt returns), but James still finished as the school's all-time leader in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns."

Nyheim (pronounced nie-HEEM) earned honorable mention All-ACC notice as a specialist that year and started five of 12 games played. Between his freshman and sophomore years, Hines ran the 100 meters and 4x100-meter relay for State, earning All-American and All-ACC honors. In 2016, he played in 12 games, starting six as a receiver (43 receptions, 525 yards), running the ball on occasion (13 attempts, 44 yards) and again serving as the primary kick returner (32 returns, 782 yards, one touchdown). Hines led the ACC in all-purpose yards as a junior despite being slowed mid-season by an ankle injury. He started 12 of 13 games in 2017, leading the team with 1,112 rushing yards and 12 touchdowns on 197 carries. Hines also caught 26 passes for 152 yards, returned 11 punts for 135 yards and a score, and brought back 21 kickoffs for 469 yards. He was named a finalist for the Paul Hornung Award as the nation's top all-purpose back, and ACC coaches named him first-team all-conference as a running back and voted him to the third team as a specialist."

Longhorn coaches could not wait to get him on the field in 2015, as the true freshman's long, lean build, exceptional athleticism, and quickness allowed him to start nine of 11 games played (he missed time with an ankle injury). He started with a bang, picking up nine tackles, 2.5 for loss, in the season opener against Notre Dame. The Big 12 Defensive Freshman of the Year, honorable mention All-Big 12 selection, and consensus Freshman All-American finished the year with 61 tackles, seven for loss, 2.5 sacks, three pass breakups, and a forced fumble. Jefferson struggled with a concussion as a sophomore, starting in nine of 11 games again but still garnering second-team All-Big 12 accolades by league media (62 tackles, 8.5 for loss, 5.5 sacks, three pass breakups). He was healthy enough to start all 13 games in 2017, leading the Longhorns with 110 tackles (10 for loss, four sacks) and earning second-team Associated Press All-American status and first-team all-conference accolades."

He was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, and starred as a High School All-American at Butler High School, winning three state titles while being ranked as a top-100 overall recruit nationally. Kalambayi did not play in 2013, but took an important role as a pass rusher the following year (32 tackles, 9.5 for loss, 6.5 sacks in 13 games). He was again a key reserve in 2015, compiling 52 tackles, 5.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks, and three pass breakups. Kalambayi earned a starting role for 13 games in his junior season, posting 45 stops, six for loss, and 3.5 sacks."

Excellent footwork in tight quarters. Has balance and vision to navigate fluid run lanes. Glides behind lead blockers allowing them to do their work. Wiggle makes him dangerous in space. Not much tread off his tires as a runner. Averaged 7.1 yards per carry against SEC competition including 101 against Alabama",

Wilkins' 6.5 yards-per-carry average finished second in the SEC, and he finished the year by racking up 110 yards and two scores against Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl win. In 2015, Wilkins started two of 13 games, finishing with 379 yards and four touchdowns on 72 totes (five catches for 75 yards). He had similar success as a redshirt freshman, playing in all 13 games and running 52 times for 361 yards and a score.

Athletic ability to physically recover and make plays after being knocked off-balance. Long strides help him cover a lot of territory in first three steps as rusher. Terrific arm length. Has tools to become a capable edge-setter as 3-4 outside backer. Able to stab and convert speed-to-power in driving tackles backward into pocket. Showed flashes of his old self in Florida State game that carried on through the end of the season. Began to string rush moves together towards end of the season.

Young's tape near the end of the year was substantially better than early on and there is a chance he could round back into his old form, but Combine medicals will be essential in giving him that chance. A move from 4-3 end to a role as stand-up outside linebacker could benefit him.",

Young returned for the 2017 season opener, however, starting 12 of 13 games played. He finished the year with 62 tackles, 12 for loss, 4.5 sacks, and five pass breakups. Young first held the starting role in 2015, earning honorable mention All-ACC honors (eight starts in 12 games played, 32 tackles, 10 for loss, 8.5 sacks, interception, two forced fumbles). He played 11 games as a reserve in 2014 after transferring from Iowa Western Community College, where he was a second-team All-American in his lone season there (22 tackles for loss, 13.5 sacks).

Doesn't create as much downfield separation as he could with better route leverage. Doesn't extend to pluck and allows throws to get into him. Hand strength is below average.

But it was St. Brown's game that really got him noticed as a recruit, as he earned a top 100 overall prospect rankings after excelling his final two years (74 catches, 1,210 yards, 10 touchdowns) at Servite High School in Anaheim. Equanimeous (a form of equanimity, meaning to stay calm and cool under pressure) played in seven games as a freshman (one catch, eight receiving yards, blocked punt against USC), missing the final four with a shoulder injury. He and Deshone Kizer formed an alliance in 2016, however, allowing him to use his tall frame, huge catching radius, and long strides to lead the Irish with 58 receptions, 961 yards, and nine receiving touchdowns. Notre Dame's passing game went south with Brandon Winbush leading the offense, so St. Brown's statistics dropped (33 catches, 515 yards, four touchdowns). After his brother, Amon-Ra, decided to attend USC instead of UND as a five-star receiver recruit, Equanimeous' road to the NFL was paved."

Consistent in getting to playside and backside blocks. Good second and third step quickness for backside cutoff positioning before sliding his frame ahead of the defender. Very good timing working up to linebackers. Initial pass slides are quick and choppy. Uses strong, well-timed punch from his outside hand. Can rattle pads when he lands. Shuffles through punch and can run edge rushers up the pocket. Has adequate athletic ability for recovery when beaten. Quick to search for twist when his rusher voids",

Inconsistent weight displacement in sets when he fears edge speed. Can be tilted, with well-timed stab move. Average redirect to mirror counters. Bends at the waist and over-extends.

Excellent bend to sink and explode out of breaks and give quarterbacks an open target. Aggressive working back to the throw when needed. Capable on all three levels. Stacker and tracker.

Struggles badly to finish catches outside his frame. Stays planted in grass from zone rather than sliding to throws when being thrown open.

Teams may be willing to live with some of the drops as long as he's making big plays, but he can't make big plays unless he is much more disciplined and focused in the pros than he was in college.

Uses well-timed jabs from press to disrupt receiver's release. Quick backpedal to match early stages of route. Exceptional long speed carrying a 4.3 40-yard dash time to his name. Matches deep route and gets head around early to find ball flight. Baseball background shows up with ball tracking and high-pointing. Believes every football is his. Quick to crowd the catch with good burst to close on throws. Outstanding ball production with 53 career passes defensed and 15 interceptions. Utilizes half-man coverage approach for greater access into passing lane to disrupt throws. Offers punt return potential that could raise his stock a round. Not a heavy hitter, but a willing tackler with adequate toughness in run support.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Defaults to high side of the right allowing for easier separation on comebacks. Has tendency to lunge to maintain feel for the route. Forward momentum slows transitions when planting and driving forward on the throw. Chance-taker who loses discipline in coverage at times. Double moves and multi-break routes cause him trouble. Wraps arm around receiver's waist when attacking the passing lane. Mauls top of routes and could face early penalty trouble. Tendency to undercut deep routes and play dangerous game of jump ball."

While he faced a lower level of competition, he possesses the size, speed, athletic ability and instincts that should be able to translate to the league. Smith has the potential to fight for either an outside or slot role, but he'll need to play with better discipline in order to avoid penalties and big plays.",
                "Player Bio": "Smith was the Alabama 3A High School Player of the Year at quarterback, but also shined as a defensive back. UCA coaches lined him up on defense as a true freshman in all 12 games, and he led the team with three interceptions while breaking up four passes. Smith started all 11 games in 2015, garnering first-team All-Southland Conference honors after recording 51 tackles, three for loss, tied for the team lead with five interceptions and broke up 12 passes. He was a first-team all-conference pick in 2016 (13 starts, 35 tackles, two interceptions, 11 pass breakups, 25 punt returns for 224 yards) and 2017 (41 tackles, 2.5 for loss, five interceptions (one touchdown), 11 pass breakups, 14 punt returns for 71 yards). The Associated Press recognized his talents after last season, as well, naming him a third-team FCS All-American."

Asked to line up over slot and handle man cover duties. Operates with smooth backpedal and loose hips to match route breaks. Clocked speed shows up on tape with easy burst to close or to recover. Turns to find and close targets quickly after recognizing play-action. Has ability to handle combination safety role. Impressive ball production in limited time at USM. Able to blaze down the alley and catch running backs before they turn the corner. Willing hitter.",

His effort in her name as a 13-game starter and honorable mention All-Conference USA selection in 2017, leading the Golden Eagles with 87 tackles, three for loss, three interceptions, and 10 pass breakups. The previous season, Moore was a reserve defensive back, credited with 17 tackles, two interceptions, and two pass breakups. The Quitman, Mississippi transferred to USM from Pearl River Community College after the 2015 season. He was a first-team all-state pick his sophomore year as a defensive back (72 tackles, one interception, eight pass breakups) and kick returner (averaged 39.6 yards per kickoff return with one touchdown).
