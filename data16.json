                    "Bottom Line": "Quick-'twitch, athletic guard who comes from a football family and has been working on his strength and athleticism from a young age. Offensive line coaches will appreciate Westerman's technical savvy and zone scheme teams will covet his fluidity and blocking ability on the move. A move to center is not out of the question thanks to his body type and quickness and his draft stock may be helped by a potential ability to offer roster depth at several offensive line positions.",

Can get to difficult cross'-face blocks using timing, technique and footwork. At his best when on the move. When pulling or climbing to second level, has a terrific connect rate against moving targets in space. True technician. Plays with desired balance and base and his feet rarely stop chopping and working after contact. Approaches target with bend and rolls hips up under him after contact. Has massive bear paws for hands and is a weight 'room freak daddy. Has hand placement and upper body strength to lockout pass rushers if he gets extension first. Father was a three-year starter at guard for Arizona State. Should test off the charts at the combine.",
                    "Weaknesses": "While he moves stacks of weights with ease, his play strength doesn't always match that when matched up against interior power players. Short yardage push will not be an NFL strength. May need more mass on his frame to handle NFL defensive tackles. When asked to base block, becomes more of a stalemate blocker than block'-winner. Could use a more authoritative punch in pass protection. I question whether he can effectively re'direct interior pass rushers once they get into the edge on him.",

Tireless worker bee in the weight room and in practices who brings a high degree of dependability and consistency to the table. Team'-oriented. Played exceptionally well while out of position at left tackle for Kansas State. Atypical body composure and control. Is almost always in complete control of his body thanks to outstanding core strength and balance. Extremely efficient with his movements after the snap. Has played both guard and both tackle spots and has roster value at all five positions. Mirrors with a wide, stout base and has great feel for keeping defender squared up throughout the rep. Confident, composed and competitive. Smooth and athletic when asked to pull and has radar to find target and strike accurate blow. Makes up for shorter arms with massive hands that function as vise grips. Consistent with hand placement and extremely sticky blocker. Combines hand strength and balance to snatch and control a defender until the whistle blows. Can sink hips at contact and should be able to stalemate bigger players across from him. Exceptional body control and core strength allows him to successfully redirect defenders who get to his edge.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Arm length is below average for interior lineman. Allows longer defenders into his framework a little too often. Needs to play with slightly faster hands inside and improve the timing of his punch. May not be able to carry much more mass on his frame. Has core power but lack of length and overall girth could lead to him allowing some pocket push against bull rushers. Played from two-'point stance as tackle in college and needs to prove he can fire out of three-'point stance and generate push at the point of attack in the running game. May need additional work and reps to get timing and angles right from the guard spot. Will get caught lunging at times when playing in space.",

Broke school record with six squats of 690 pounds and partially tore his pectoral muscle during one off-'season attempting to bench press 515 pounds (did not miss any games). Takes good angles up to second level on zone plays targeting the outside shoulder of the linebacker. Solid short area foot quickness and adequate athleticism. Able to make quick step inside to catch stunts and inside pass rush moves. Smooth, well-'balanced pass sets out to defensive ends. Plays with ready hands. Has potential to land heavy punch in pass protection. When he gets on top of edge rushers, understands how to crowd them and take away their options. Mindful of twists and stunts and sees \"games\" early.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Still a little raw in his pass sets. Relies on opening gate and chasing edge rusher up the field rather than trusting footwork. Gets a little loose with his feet on high side of the arc and might open up inside counter moves to the quarterback (as a tackle). Has shorter arms than teams desire from tackles. Will get too cute with his hands at times rather than landing a big punch and snatching his target. Top heavy, barrel-chested build. Needs to play with better bend and wider base in space. Gets caught on skates and unable to change directions quickly when forced to adjust to moving targets on second level. As a guard, must be careful not to over-commit to first block T/E twists.",

Has hand quickness to move inside. Does a nice job of shifting weight to challenge inside moves. Coaches rave about his work habits and ability to retain information. Added weight and then muscle to his frame over last two years. Works his tail off to recover when beaten in pass protection. Constantly looking for work and will cave in pass rusher engaged with his teammate.",

Doesn't possess second level quickness to consistently get to cut'off blocks. Sluggish change of direction may turn his near misses into sacks and tackles for losses against NFL athletes. Arm length is below average so he will need more core strength to drop anchor and take a stand.

Held his own in the power department against UCLA's Kenny Clark. If he gets downhill momentum on defender, it's lights out. Able to strike and center his blocks between his shoulders. Team captain. Very good hand placement, upper body strength and hip torque to steer and turn opponent on hook blocks. Generates good power from legs and hips. Block winner in tight space near goal line. Takes good angles to second level block to make up for his lack of athleticism. Hard to beat him early in the rep on run plays. Can bury gap shooters with cave'-in blocks.

Falls in love with mashing opponents within the early stages of a rep and forgets to bring his feet under him to secure the block causing him to fall off at times. Head'-ducking pass protector who misses twists at times because he sees them too late. Opens himself up to problems against crafty defensive tackles by leaning too much in protection.

The Associated Press voted him second team All-American in 2015, as well, as he joined a bevy of talented defenders and Heisman hopeful quarterback Deshaun Watson in putting together an undefeated regular season and national championship game appearance."

Plays with smooth backpedal and adequate footwork and looks to have. Always active. Former high school receiver with plus ball tracking and ball skills over the top.

Struggles to disengage quickly when locked up by offensive linemen. Doesn't adjust pursuit path to runners, allowing combo blockers to find him. Lacks patience. Rushes downhill almost every snap and often runs himself into trouble and out of pursuit. Instincts and vision are poor. Easily fooled by play-action and can be a step late to diagnose the action.

Plays with pre'-snap idea of where ball is headed and races to the spot ahead of linemen looking to climb up and block him. Well'-schooled in his hand play. Shoots a jarring punch into blockers and keeps himself clean to chase the steak. Finished with 42 more tackles than the next linebacker in the SEC. Gap responsible and has the play strength to stand up to blockers. Great finisher as tackler. His huge hands can turn a diving arm tackle into a finish.

While his lack of physical traits could hurt where he is taken in the draft, his functional strength, technical savvy, athleticism and body control should not be ignored as he has all the makings of an eventual NFL starter.",

Controlled glider up to inside linebackers and plays with plus body control. Patient, confident run blocker who consistently lands his blocks in the center of his targets. Keeps his feet grinding after contact to generate movement and prolonged engagement as a blocker. Sticks to opponents like a shadow and is always bodied up near his man. Excellent outside zone blocker. Uses feet and upper body strength to run gap'-shooters up the field past the quarterback. The Hawkeyes love pulling him and using as lead blocker in space. Technician able to snap and step quickly on reach blocks. Sinks hips and can anchor up against bull rushers. Good functional strength for his size. Played in over 96 percent of team's offensive snaps over last three years.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Undersized by every standard that NFL teams use for centers. Lack of length and mass is a legitimate concern moving forward. Has played both guard spots and center, but size likely limits him to center only in the league. Teams may view him as fit for zone specific teams which could limit his draft stock. Catches pass rushers rather than punching. Will have to adjust to defensive tackles using length to disrupt his task. Tape shows potential mental mistakes in protection against blitzes.",

Blythe didn't miss any more games during his three final years with the Hawkeyes, starting all 40 games at center.

Refuses to quit on a rep. Possesses huge, strong hands that snatch target and allow him to hang against aggressive power players looking to shed. Plays with consistent hand placement.

Appears to have adequate foot quickness to redirect back inside and is able to mirror rushers. Careful with his punch and won't give away hands too early. Fires off a heavy, well-'timed punch with some heat behind it. Aggressive approach in pass pro. Looks to take it to the defensive ends rather than sitting back passively and reacting to their rush. Was invited by former NFL GM Phil Savage to play in the Reese's Senior Bowl. Has a basketball background in high school.",

Foot quickness is very average laterally. Marginal bend and foot quickness could present a major concern when asked to cross-'face and secure blocks against NFL athletes. Shuffles wide in his pass sets and doesn't always maintain proper weight inside opening him up to inside counters in pass rush. Opens and chases at the top of the rush rather than calmly riding rusher around the arc. Too much gallop in his pass sets and not enough quick, choppy steps. Narrow base and lack of hip flexion could indicate an issue with speed-'to'-power rushers. Play strength looks very average.",

It's unclear where Clark's best position will be at the next level; he flashes the lateral agility and recovery speed to play on the edge against college pass rushers, so he should get a shot at left tackle. It's possible, though, that Clark might be best inside where he can lock on and create creases for the running game. His durability, pro-ready body (6-6, 313), and next-level tenacity make him a likely NFL starter wherever he lines up."

Very good hip sink to stop quickly and open up to the quarterback. Route running shows promise. Smooth with change of direction and works back to the ball. Able to make sharp cuts out of breaks and does a nice job of selling double moves. Consistently tracks and high-'points downfield throws and is able to adjust to throws high, low and outside. Generally reliable hands and showed toughness in making catches where he know he was going to take a big shot.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Doesn't have plus size or speed to consistently threaten outside cornerbacks. Speedy cornerbacks sat on his routes and showed little respect for his long speed. Can be knocked off schedule by physical cornerbacks. Must prove he can adjust routes without the noticeable slowing that the tape shows. Has room for improvement with leveraging of routes to create more separation for out-breaking routes. Will duck head and give away timing of when he's going to sink his routes to man cornerbacks. Would like to see better separation ability underneath. Knee injuries slowed his career so his medicals could be a concern. Not as effective as a blocker in space as some teams will want.",

Light on his feet using outstanding jump 'cut and lateral quickness to sidestep danger in the backfield and create a positive play. Elusiveness on second level often leaves tacklers grasping at air. Able to string moves together and hit the explosive play. Despite being keyed on, still creates yardage for himself. Determined and competitive. Accelerates through initial contact and squeezes carries for everything he can. Averaged almost twice as many yards per carry after first contact (3.3) than before first contact (1.7). Greedy eater when endzone in his sights with 39 rushing touchdowns since 2014. Quick recognition of defensive flow and adjusts running lanes accordingly. Decisive runner with plus burst and ability to charge it up to his top speed instantly. Has very \r\ngood feel for running lanes and tacklers and is able to navigate both without much wasted movement. Violent finisher for his size and enjoys thumping corners and safeties. Reliable pass catcher who can hurt teams out of the backfield.",

Physical running style could lead to durability concerns. Not as likely to slip out of side doors against substantially better competition. Average long speed makes him more slasher than home-run hitter. Competitive resolve leads him to try and do too much on some snaps. Base narrows in space and can be susceptible to shoestring tackles. Aggression and competitiveness as a runner isn't as readily available in pass protection. Needs to improve ball security. Has fumbled 13 times over last three seasons.",

Willing to aggressively finish runs. Will gain more yards post-contact than expected. Very quick feet with the lateral agility to escape from heavy traffic and bounce it outside.

Quality hands and can function as pass catcher with some matchup potential. Very good play speed and can punch the gas to top speed quickly. High-'knee runner who can gain yardage in chunks if run fits break down. Scored three touchdowns on kickoffs over freshman and sophomore year and has returned kicks all four seasons.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Thin, angular frame that isn't built for sustaining contact. Runs come to a screeching halt against quality, bodied'-up tackle attempts. Balance through contact is poor and has trouble grinding legs through arm tackles. Hits from the side cause him to go flying. Not a one'-cut runner.

Has catcher's mitts for hands. Arms are a little short for the position but his hand quickness into blocker's frame and instant arm extension make his arm length irrelevant. Engages, controls and slides down the line looking to finish the run before it gets started. Great vision and instincts to find ball quickly. Reads running back's lane choice and discards blocker with excellent timing.

Can get to shoulder of blocker and get him leaning and then uses club/hump move to knock him off balance and attack the vacated position. Powerful base and very rarely off his feet. Can power through redirect blocks and maintain a path for the ball. Has good feel for screen plays and chases them down down with great intensity.

He has been extremely productive as a bull'rusher and edge rusher and he can hold the point of attack or play in gaps. Rankins is a ball of power with rare foot quickness, a great motor and outstanding feel for his position. With so many teams playing in sub'packages now, I would expect both 4-'3 and 3-'4 teams to consider him for an interior spot despite his shorter stature. Thanks to Rankins' ability to disrupt, I think he has a great shot at getting starter's snaps early on, but don't be shocked to see him fall a little in the draft due to his smaller stature.",

Fires into blockers and can jolt and displace them with a combination of leverage and power. Strong base provides excellent balance to battle against double teams or down blocks. At times, will absolutely own finesse blockers. Elite foot quickness for interior defender. Will be difficult to hook or cross'face for NFL offensive linemen because of his lateral quickness. Plays with powerful, violent hands. Can play in 2'-gap or 1-'gap scheme and did just that at Louisville. Plays through the blocker reading and shedding on time to make tackles against the run. Loose, explosive hips that allow him to win edge battles and turn the corner as pass rusher and potentially excel in twist game. Highly productive pass rusher in each of the last two season. Bloodhound with great instincts to diagnose and shut'down screens.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Undersized for full-'time interior position by NFL standards. Flashes quite a bit on tape, but many of his victims lacked the strength that he'll see from NFL guards. Despite having decent arm length, is hardly \r\nlong-'levered and could struggle to turn the corner against an NFL redirect block once he gets on a guard's edge. Average secondary rush when his initial charge is stymied. Scouts believe he could lose some quickness if he tries to bulk up to prepare for rigors of NFL interior play.

Able to coordinate hands and feet smoothly and has change of direction and closing burst to become a dominant pass rusher from inside. Can slide from gap to gap as a pass rusher and is a perfect fit for twist-'based defense. Generally attacks gaps with forward lean and ability to corner the edge when he has his man beat.

Plays with very little dynamic movement as a pass rusher and usually just crashes straight ahead with no real plan. Hand usage needs major work. Doesn't use hands effectively to control the point of attack or to improve his position as a pass rusher. Needs to play square and control gaps when engaged laterally against the run.

Lawson is built like a full'-grown man and combines his instincts, toughness and power to fill up a stat sheet and set an early tone. Lawson's frame and game are easily translatable to the NFL, but his average athleticism and pass rush skills will likely have teams viewing him as a 3'-4 edge setter or a 4-'3 base end.

Able to shock and shed blockers and has the hand quickness to staggered block attempts. Power allows him to play on other side of the line.

Has plus instincts and feel for the game. Toughness in full display.",

Not a natural hip bender and will have to focus on keeping pad level lower to unlock his leverage potential. Shows obvious signs of fatigue as game wears on. At times, is too content to lean on blocks when play isn't run to his side rather than working to discard. Will have snaps where he seems more concerned with imposing  his will on blocking rather than diagnosing the play. Doesn't have the bend or upper body flexion to be edge turner as pass rusher. Effort sacks will diminish in pros and will need to become more nuanced pass rusher.",

With the departure of the likes of Vic Beasley and Malliciah Goodman, Lawson finally got a chance to start in 2015 and made the most of it, constantly exploding into the backfield to finish among the nation's leaders in tackles for loss (25.5) and sacks (12.5). Lawson's personal accomplishments (consensus All-American, first-team All-ACC) led to great team success, as he and fellow junior Kevin Dodd and sophomore Heisman Trophy candidate Deshaun Watson helped the Tigers to an undefeated regular season, ACC title, and national championship game appearance."

Runs through tackles with as much force as he can muster with his size.",

Threat with his legs, scoring 37 rushing touchdowns over last three seasons and had 94 rushes of ten yards or more during that time. Can be used as goal-'line rushing option.

Accuracy on intermediate and deep throws dropped sharply. Pocket poise has been compromised. Hyper' aware of pressure around him and lacks awareness to slide and find temporary shelter to make throw. Concern over pressure too often trumps ability to get through progressions. Must speed up the pace of his reads. Footwork is a mess. Slight stride onto stiff upper leg with little weight shift.

Straight-'liner who cranks up initial push as bull-'rusher, but stalls out due to leverage loss. Needs to play with wider base to improve balance and base. Able to get upfield as an edge rusher, but rarely turns corner. Too content to lay on blocks when rush stalls rather than spin underneath or unleash a club move.

He's also a better athlete than most people realize, showing the agility to spin off blocks and make plays in the backfield (15 tackles for loss, 8.5 sacks in 2013-2014). His senior year capped an excellent career, with a highlight being his school-record six tackles for loss against Nebraska. He finished as a second-team All-Big Ten honoree with 46 tackles, 13.5 for loss, and three sacks. Lowry could play multiple spots along the line depending on his new team's defensive scheme."

Generated top-'end production by combining his power and dynamic athletic traits. Improved his pad level as rusher creating dominating pocket push that he was able to convert into sacks and knockdowns. Rare tackle production for defensive lineman with 163 over last two seasons. Long arms and good play speed allow him maximum field coverage to tackle. Flexible upper body. Can flip shoulders, then hips around the edge of blockers allowing him to play on the other side of the line. Has size and athleticism for scheme versatility.

Needs to bend more when penetrating in order to avoid redirect blocks. Will need to play with wider base to take on blockers on next level.

Able to brush away a weak punch with ease. At times, flashes unusual ability to trim the edge with power over speed. Uses power and a late rip move to win around corner.

Elusive in open space dodging blockers and sifting through traffic in pursuit of the ball. Has the traits to be highly effective in man coverage. As an edge rusher, able to shoot out of the starting blocks and cover substantial ground with long second and third strides. Not a great bender, but has ankle flexion necessary to lean at 45-'degree angle and buzz inside the rush arc. Substantial pass rush potential with a variety of options to the quarterback.

His 2014 season, which included 163 tackles, 29 tackles for losses, 14 sacks and six forced fumbles, is widely considered the most productive for a linebacker in college football history.

His junior year was much more of a struggle than he expected, as he played just three games due first to a torn lateral meniscus in this left knee and then to a sprained right foot.

Plays with smooth backpedal and good route recognition. Has the twitch to spring into action and attack at the catch point. Uses length as disruptive tactic from press. Fluid hips and shows ability to blanket underneath. Allowed just one touchdown in 44 targets. Competitor who doesn't back down from physical challenges. Steps downhill against the run and is willing to sacrifice his body to contain. Runs through blockers on his way to support the run and is a quality tackler with no broken tackles allowed all season.",

Killebrew reached the triple-digit mark in tackles the past two seasons (101 in 2014, 132 in 2015) and also showed an ability to handle his pass coverage responsibilities each year (three interceptions, one for a touchdown in 2014, seven pass break-ups in 2015).

More functional scrambler than \"tuck and run\" quarterback. Sacked just 15 times over 477 drop backs. Able to win with his feet when he needs to. Has a quick release to overcome his slight wind'-up. Has enough arm to drive the ball into restricted windows. Has enough arm to attack downfield while on the move. Makes good decisions. Rarely takes the cheese when cornerbacks try and bait him. Displays qualities of a field leader and isn't easy to rattle. Yards per attempt have exploded over his last two years. Can gain chunk yards as zone-read quarterback and will appeal to boot'-action teams. Will be challenging to defend in the red area. Took better care of the football cutting turnovers down from 16 last season to just four this year. Completed 54.6 percent on intermediate throws (11'20) and 44.9 percent on deep balls (21-plus yards) including 19 touchdowns and just two interceptions.",

Must learn to better anticipate routes and stay ahead in the rep. Doesn't quite have the quickness through progressions that he will need in the pros. Has to learn to move defenders around with his eyes to open throwing lanes. At times, crowds targets against the sideline. Needs to stop babying play-'action passes and cut them loose. Consistency of arm strength has been overstated. Inconsistent weight transfer in delivery forces him to muscle some throws. Perimeter throws lack velocity and will nose'dive on him.

Lynch went through some ups and downs in his first year as a starter, throwing nine touchdowns against 10 interceptions and completing just 58 percent of his passes for about 2,000 yards in 2013. He improved greatly as a sophomore, leading his team to a 10-win season and American Athletic Conference championship. He received second team All-AAC honors that season by completing 63 percent of his passes for 3,031 yards and 22 scores.  Lynch exploded onto the national scene during his junior year, garnering a Manning Award finalist nod, first team All-ACC honors, and team MVP after leading the Tigers to an 8-0 start before the team struggled down the stretch losing to Navy, Houston, and Temple. During the team's hot streak, Lynch beat SEC foe Ole Miss with a 39-for-53, 386-yard, three-touchdown performance. But the next time he faced a SEC defense, Auburn took him to task in the Birmingham Bowl, forcing him to complete just 16 of 37 pass attempts for a measly 106 yards and an interception.

In fact, he earned both the Pac-12 Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year award in 2013, as well as being named finalist for Paul Hornung Award as the nation's most versatile player.  A second-team All-Pac 12 defender as a freshman (75 tackles, two interception, 11 passes defended), he had seven rushing touchdowns on the year as well. Pac-12 coaches voted him second team all-conference again in 2014, as he made 88 tackles, eight for loss, intercepted one pass and broke up seven others. He also contributed as a runner, as well, carrying the rock 28 times for 113 yards and three scores. Jack's junior year was stopped short by a knee injury three games in, though he looked like he was on the way to a fantastic season before the malady occurred (15 tackles, interception). Despite the injury, Jack announced he had \"done enough\" at UCLA and wanted to be compensated for his play -- so he declared for early entry in the 2016 NFL Draft. Considering that his mother insured Jack against injury after his freshman season, it's not surprising that economics won the day in Jack's decision."

Sees throws come open but won't always cut it loose. Can struggle mightily when forced off of his first option. Misses opportunities to adjust protection pre-'snap. Gets locked in on shotgun snap and misses signs of blitzers sneaking forward. First instinct versus blitz is to go up top rather than finding easier, short completion.

Extremely physical with backpack full of nasty with him. Drive blocker who uproots defenders and creates space. Latches onto defenders with big, strong hands. Gets chippy as run blocker and looks for aggressive finish. Pass sets are generally balanced with decent slide to the edge and ready hands. Has ability to redirect inside against stunts. Very heavy hands. Uses his punch as a measure of force and intimidation. Fires his hands from inside his frame and lands with proper placement. Able to play in space. Relatively smooth climbs to second level and mirrors oncoming traffic looking to engage. Has played on left and right side. Held his own against Myles Garrett from Texas A&M losing badly just once on inside spin move.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Base will get too wide hindering balance. Leans into contact in pass sets and consistently plays with weight too far forward. Feet deaden when punching, opening door around the corner. Inconsistent footwork in general. Lunges at rushers trying to turn corner rather than sliding feet into position. Has habit of leading with head down and will miss run targets at times. Got away with holding in college. Doesn't bring feet thru contact in run game and has trouble sustaining without mauling. Needs hands to control defender rather than just punish. Will turn 25 as a rookie after sitting out two years overcoming a leukemia diagnosis in 2010.",

In the spring of 2010, Coleman was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Over the next two-plus years, the top 10 offensive tackle national recruit worked at St. Jude's Children's Hospital (located in his hometown of Memphis) to treat and defeat the disease. Coleman was finally cleared to play in the spring of 2012 and redshirted in the fall to get back into football shape. The following year he completed the comeback by playing six games as the backup to 2014 NFL Draft No. 2 overall selection Greg Robinson at left tackle. The past two seasons, Coleman has held down the blind side spot, starting every game and receiving second team All-SEC honors from league coaches. Casual college football fans and NFL scouts alike can see his frame and excellent length and agility, but should be more impressed by the mental toughness he's shown over the past few years."

Snuffs out screens, bootlegs and shovel passes almost every game. Takes his contain responsibility very seriously.  Insane production spike from last year to this season. Saw his quarterback pressures go from three to 46 and he was credited with 12 sacks in 2015 season. Athletic upfield burst with desired bend and hip flexion to corner the edge.

Burns translated that dual success in high school to the Hurricanes, winning All-American and All-Conference honors as a hurdler for the track and field squad and becoming one of the top corners in the ACC. Burns played in a reserve role as a freshman in 2013 (17 tackles, two sacks, three pass breakups) before becoming a starter in his sophomore year (40 tackles, six pass breakups). He flourished in 2015, intercepting six passes (most by a Miami player since Sean Taylor had 10 in 2003) and breaking up five others on his way to consensus second-team All-ACC honors. Unfortunately, Burns also suffered a great loss during his junior year, losing his mother after she suffered a heart attack. Since his father has been incarcerated for some time, the University of Miami started a donation fund to help his family get through the rough period -- they raised $40,000 in six hours. It was not surprising, therefore, that he wanted to declare for the 2016 NFL Draft as an early entrant."

Once on top of cornerbacks, looks to stack them to create throwing window for touch throws. Excellent at tracking the deep ball. Has 19 catches of 25-plus yards.

Has the speed and toughness to work all three levels of the field. Can own the Y'-seam with his vertical speed and hands.

                    "Bottom Line": "While the pedigree and the body type look the part, continued tape study begins to uncover core strength issues that permeate several facets of his game. As a run blocker, his inability to drive and sustain blocks is a concern while his pass protection shows a good, initial pass set that turns into leaning to make up for his lack of anchor. While Haeg has the athletic traits of a zone blocking tackle, it won't matter without better functional power.",

Plays with good posture in his pass sets and uses his length effectively. Can get to the perimeter quickly and seal the edge when asked to short pull around the corner. Agile with lateral quickness. Drives his feet up and along line of scrimmage to maintain leverage in zone engagement. Doesn't panic against spin moves in pass rush.",

Core strength looks like a major concern. Wasn't challenged by premier athletes on the edge. Timing on combo blocks needs work. Shows better athletic ability laterally than when asked to find targets in space. Zone scheme only lineman. Leans and pushes rather than driving with his lower body.

Doesn't have twitch or fluid change of direction found in most smallish corners. Gets caught guessing on route recognition. Open to a side early and, at times, in the wrong direction.

That success earned him a shared starting spot in his sophomore year (one interception, five pass break-ups). He became a playmaker as a junior, picking off opposing quarterback four times, leading the conference with 153 return yards and returning one interception for a touchdown. Young had surgery on his left knee before his senior year, but it didn't stop him from excelling in his final campaign with the Owls. His lack of statistical production kept him off all-conference teams in 2015 (41 tackles, five for loss, sack, seven pass breakups), but that was partially due to his ability to shut down opposing receivers."

Plays receivers physically when they try to block him and is excellent in run support. Diligent in run contain duties. Scouts say he is well liked in the locker room and has some edge.

He started all 15 games his senior year, improving in coverage (two INT, seven PBU) and putting to rest concerns about his hip.

Has twitch and acceleration to match slot receivers out of their breaks. Plays with outstanding awareness of man and ball in zone coverage. Snared seven interceptions over last two years.

LSU is known for the talent in their secondary, but that didn't stop Mills from starting at cornerback as a true freshman (57 tackles, two INT, five PBU) after Tyrann Mathieu was dismissed from the team.

Just before the 2015 season began, Reader decided to leave the team for personal reasons. He returned in October, playing nine games on the year (13 tackles, 1.5 for loss). Expectations were high for Reader coming into the season because the Tigers lost a lot of talent to the NFL, and he flashed as a top reserve as a sophomore (43 tackles, five TFL, three sacks) and junior (27 tackles, 2.5 TFL, 1.5 sacks). Even as a freshman, who was highly-rated as both an offensive line and defensive line prospect out of high school, Reader earned a lot of playing time (40 tackles).  He even played first base for the Clemson baseball in the spring of 2013, though his playing time was limited (0-for-3, three putouts in seven games)."

Has talent and strength to do what he wants on some snaps. Can generate a heavy pocket push when he gets some knee-'bend going. Sure'fire tackler with vision and agility to scrape down line of scrimmage and clean up runners working through line of scrimmage.",

Hands catcher with excellent hand'-eye coordination and can go get the rock in traffic. Shows enough burst to create separation from linebackers and safeties over the top. Does an adequate job of shielding defenders from the pass and posting them up in space. Strong runner after the catch in screen game and will carry defenders with him into the end zone. Willing blocker who comes from program where run blocking is demanded. Latches onto target with centered blow and shows enough strength to sustain. Looks for work downfield as blocker to help spring explosive runs.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Lacks suddenness and crisp feet in his route work underneath. Could be faced with high number of heavily contested catches in short and intermediate routes. Not much of a salesman with his routes and needs more juice from stem at top of his routes. Would improve separation by meeting physical defenders with increased physicality. Hands need work. Was late getting hands catch' ready and had nine drops over two seasons for drop rate of almost 11 percent. Catch radius just average for his size.

Even simple throws can be coin-flippers in accuracy department. Release point can vary greatly and he is still looking for repeatable footwork, mechanics and release. Will throw a spiral followed by wobbler. Ball patting and wind-up slows release and can obstruct timing. Extra air under deep balls combined with marginal timing allows safeties time to race into the play. Busted internal clock. Allows pressure to overtake him rather than getting catchable throw out a shade early. Sacked 82 times over last two years. Iffy accuracy and ball placement falls off map when defenses send pressure.

Almost 11 percent of his pass attempts were 20-plus yard completions. Completed 59 percent of intermediate throws and 41 percent of deep throws. Touch and ball placement on long ball is pro caliber. Can drop feathery, touch throws on fade routes. Has size, athleticism and toughness to call his own number in run game and is a chain mover as a scrambler.

Had issues reading and reacting to zone coverage underneath. Doesn't hold safeties with his eyes. Failed to execute timing throws out in rhythm. Will pump and re'set too often forcing out routes against the sideline. Tends to overthrow near goal line and leave touchdown passes on the field.

But when Braxton Miller and J.T. Barrett were lost to injury before and during the 2015 season, respectively, it was Jones' turn to shine. He came in for Barrett to finish off Michigan, beat down Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game, and then led the Buckeyes to a national title a month later.  Jones finished the year completing 60.0 percent of his throws for 860 yards and seven touchdowns against two interceptions, as well as rushing for 296 yards and a score. Head Coach Urban Meyer named Jones the starter after a heated battle between he and Barrett, but Jones' inconsistency caused him to lose the job to Barrett halfway through the season (eight starts, 1,460 passing yards, 62.5 percent on completions, eight TD, five INT; 193 yards, two TD rushing). With Barrett returning for another year in 2016, Jones decided to enter the NFL draft as an early entrant rather than finishing his career at another college."

Feels pressure and gets rid of the ball over taking the sack. Makes catchable, accurate throws from the pocket. Shows off NFL arm when he steps and drives to target.

It was not surprising that he become the Florida high school record-holder in rushing yards, accumulating 12,121 yards and 191 touchdowns in five years on the varsity squad (yes, he played as an eighth grader). The 2012 Lou Groza High School Player of the Year joined his father in winning the award, becoming the first family duo to do so. Taylor showed glimpses of that talent in a Freshman All-SEC season in 2013 (508 rush yards, four TD) and a sophomore season without a ton of opportunities (565 yards, six TD on 116 carries). He finally became \"the man\" for the Gators, getting 259 totes and covering 1,035 yards and scoring 13 times while also catching 17 passes for 150 yards. He might not be drafted in the first round, like his father was in 1998 by Jacksonville (ninth overall pick), but Taylor has an NFL future."

Short but muscular with well-'built calves and a toughness that belies his size. Is unafraid of the work required as an interior runner. Works to keep his pads square and runs with desired balance.

Ayers continued to return kicks in his sophomore year (34-592) but also started eight games as a receiver (33-335, two TD).  With the exciting Greg Ward, Jr. operating as the team's quarterback (and leading rusher) in 2015, Ayers fed off that energy to earn first-team all-conference with 98 catches for 1,222 yards and six scores while going back to his roots as a running back at times (25-147, one TD rushing). He also moved from returning kickoffs to taking back punts, earning first team accolades there as well (28-290, one TD). In the Cougars' Peach Bowl win over Florida State, Ayers threw for a touchdown, too.

In 2014, he was not allowed to dress for the season opener against Wisconsin and started six of eight games played (17 tackles, one pass breakup) before being suspended indefinitely in November. Head coach Les Miles never reinstated Robinson for the 2015 season, so the defender sat out the season instead of transferring to another school.

Not only did Edwards excel in that sport, but also rugby, cricket, and track and field at Ballarat University in 2012. He shared punting duties in his first year in the United States in 2013, averaging 42.3 yards on 31 punts, forcing 10 fair catches and placing 13 inside the 20 yard-line. Edwards took the starting job by the reins the following year, earning first-team All-Southland Conference honors and FCS All-American notice (44.1 average, 22 fair catches, 28 inside the 20 versus just five touchbacks). His gross average dipped in 2015 (41.5) but Edwards still received second-team All-Southland notice by placing 31-of-74 kicks inside the 20 and forcing 19 fair catches."

Doesn't have blazing speed but hit explosive play after explosive play. Good leaper with great body control to win high percentage of 50-50 balls. Good hand fighter down the sideline. Will drain every yard he can get out of every catch.",

Fuller blew up the stopwatches at his pro day, but he doesn't play to that speed on tape. His hands are good enough and he clearly has the speed and quickness to separate, but he lacks a consistently competitive effort.

Uses stutter-step with twitchy burst to get past press coverage and over the top of cornerbacks. Makes adjustments mid-route against zone coverage and settles into friendly spots for his quarterback. Steady kick returner who could compete for that spot as a rookie.",

He played nine games in 2012, starting two in spite of his inexperience as a receiver, catching 20 passes for 145 yards and two touchdowns. With a year under his belt, Fuller earned honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors in 2013 (43-471, four TD) and was second on the team with 59 receptions (447 yards, one TD) in 2014. Although Fuller started only seven games as a senior, missing games with head and ankle injuries, he returned kicks (24.2-yard average) and punts (12 for 141 yards) in addition to making plays on offense (24-259, three TD)."

Consistent accuracy numbers short, medium and deep. Keeps ball tucked to body near shoulder level and comes to balance to deliver his throws.

                    "Weaknesses": "Hands can be inconsistent at the catch point. Needs to do better job of consistently securing catch despite being pushed or hit afterwards. A little top heavy into routes causing rolling stops. Lacks suddenness into breaks. Needs better route awareness to avoid traffic. Not much tape as a blocker.",
