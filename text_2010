He is a tweener (size and athleticism) at the next level and may fit as an undersized end in a 4-3 scheme or an inexperienced outside backer in an odd front. --NAME-- is best attacking the line of scrimmage rushing the passer or penetrating to disrupt the run. He uses his hands well to control blockers on the edge. He also shows an expansive pass rush package. --NAME-- has dropped in zone coverage at times but is most comfortable with his hand on the ground. He is a solid tackler in the open field utilizing great balance and body positioning. Regardless of where --NAME-- aligns at the next level he should contribute as a rookie due to his instincts, toughness, athleticism and energy.
Main concern with --NAME-- is he?s a true tweener prospect, in terms of both size and speed, at this point.  Only possesses adequate height.  Lacks some bulk when trying to hold the edge against the run.
Can?t help but notice --NAME--? productivity as one of college football?s top pass rushers over the last few seasons.  He?s a tough, instinctive player who does a good job getting blockers off his body.  Highly athletic talent who displays range to track down running plays on the back side.  Durable. Has an expansive repertoire of pass rush moves.

Art_Jones 496800 157
--NAME-- missed some time with injury in 2009 but has been a durable player for the Orangemen most of his career. --NAME-- has a good combination of size and strength with just average athleticism. He is a solid run stopper with decent power at the point of attack. He is inconsistent to disengage to the ball and needs to improve his hand use to make him more productive in this area. --NAME-- needs to be more creative as a pass rusher as he relies too much on his bull rush move. --NAME-- is limited outside the tackle box as he is quicker than fast and doesn?t show much range in pursuit. --NAME-- will likely contribute in a backup role as a rookie but has the size and talent to develop into a starter along the defensive line.
He?s only an average athlete.  Would like to see better initial burst.  Struggles moving laterally.  Lacks the long range speed to chase down running plays from behind.  Inconsistent reactor who can be caught out of position. Shows only average hand use.
--NAME-- has a good blend of size and strength making him an effective defensive tackle against the run.  He plays with good intelligence to find the football.  Tough player who plays through the whistle.  Displays a competitive streak you love to see with your interior defenders.
-------------------------
Linval_Joseph 496802 46
--NAME-- is a big body who could line up at nose tackle in a 3-4 front or interior defender in a 4-3 scheme. He is somewhat one dimensional as a run defender. He flashes ability to anchor well when he keeps his pads down but can be very inconsistent in this area. He has strong arms and hands to control blockers but can be slow to shed to the pile. He has decent quickness between the tackles but lacks range outside the box. He flashes power to collapse the pocket as a bull rusher but needs to expand his pass-rush package to become more effective in this area. --NAME-- has enough size and strength to push for a starting role along the defensive line, but weight and durability concerns likely will affect his draft status.
There are some weight concerns with --NAME--.  He also has dealt with a back injury, so  durability is another flag.  Must become more consistent with his pad level to improve his production level.  Overall technique needs some polish, especially while rushing the passer.
--NAME-- has the size to play as a nose tackle in a 3-4 or defensive tackle in an even front.  Possesses very good natural strength and power to control the middle against the run.  Exhibits really active hands necessary to keep blockers off his body.

Sergio_Kindle 496804 43
--NAME-- is a two-year starter for the Longhorns as a defensive end but many will try and project him to outside linebacker in the NFL. He has a good combination of length and athleticism but lacks the bulk needs to be an effective run defender at the next level. He has been a disruptive force penetrating the line of scrimmage in the Longhorns 4-3 front.  --NAME-- runs well but doesn?t have elite speed or range for a stand up player and will need lots of work developing his coverage techniques and awareness. He is inconsistent using his hands to maintain leverage on his opponent and will need to improve in this area both as a pass rusher as well as run defender. --NAME-- does play hard and has a frame to add at least 20 pounds, which bodes well for his potential as a special team?s contributor as well being utilized as a backup linebacker or edge rusher in sub packages.
Main area of concern is his lack of weight and strength, but does have room on his frame to add bulk.  Struggles with his hand use when disengaging against the run.  Possesses tweener size and athleticism.  Has some off-field issues (DWI arrest, driving car into apartment complex and leaving the scene).
--NAME--?s a long, rangy player who projects best as a 3-4 outside linebacker at the next level.  Productive player.  Plays with a relentless motor not only as a pass rusher but also in run pursuit. Has good instincts playing with his hand down and off the line of scrimmage.  Short area burst and speed are his best attribute, especially when turned loose rushing the passer.
-------------------------
Jammie_Kirlew 496806 232
--NAME-- was a productive, three-year starter for the Indiana's defense. He is somewhat of a 'tweener prospect with average size for a defensive end but lacking great athleticism to project to outside linebacker. He is a tough, hardnosed player with great work ethic and intelligence. He plays with a high motor and wins with effort and technique more than athleticism. --NAME-- has been a playmaker off the edge but doesn't have great initial quickness and burst to close to the ball. He is an instinctive player who understands angles and locates the ball quickly. He is inconsistent to shed larger blockers, which likely will hinder his ability to play with his hand in the dirt at the next level. --NAME-- is a good college football player but is a classic overachiever, and his talent may not project in the same way at the next level.
Does not have the size to be a defensive end and lacks the lateral quickness to make plays in space as a linebacker.  Not explosive enough to consistently get after the quarterback.  Shows inconsistent hand use and takes too long to shed blocks. Lacks the fluidity and burst to be effective in zone or man coverage.
--NAME-- is a fierce competitor who  plays much bigger than his measurables. Well-prepared player who  reads his keys and locates the ball fast.  Fires off the ball low and gets good leverage. Fights to the whistle every play and makes plays pursuing from behind due to sheer effort.
-------------------------
Austen_Lane 496808 153
--NAME-- was a four-year starter for the Racers. He has good size and strength for the position but lacks great range and quickness. He makes more plays with effort and persistence than athleticism. He doesn't have great speed to close to the ball and lacks good flexibility to bend down the line of scrimmage. --NAME-- leverages the ball well with good hand use and proper technique. He needs to expand his pass-rush package with more counters off his initial power move. --NAME-- played best against lower-level competition and was somewhat held at bay when stepping up against better competition.
Lacks a good first step and does not have the speed to make plays all over the field.  Not a natural knee-bender and loses leverage too often.

Tall kid with a thick, muscular build.  Reads his keys and finds the ball quickly.  Uses his hands to get inside and locks out his arms.  Gets his hands up and bats balls at the line.  Relentless kid who never stops working.
-------------------------
Erik_Lorig 496812 253
--NAME-- possesses the size, strength and motor to develop into a possible reserve at the next level.  However, his lack of athleticism and overall instincts will make it very tough for him to crack a starting lineup.  --NAME-- projects as a late-round pick or free-agent developmental project.
Does not have the balance, fluidity and flexibility to get around the edge.  Average speed and limited range prevents him from getting a consistent pass rush.  Stays too high and struggles to move laterally, making him a liability in space.  Lacks adequate awareness and too often fails to locate the ball carrier.
Tall enough with a thick and muscular build.  Strong bull rusher who stays low to get underneath blockers' pads.  Very disruptive in the running game with good first step and punch.  Competitive player who fights to the whistle every play.
-------------------------
Gerald_McCoy 496816 3

He has strong quick hands to control blockers but can improve his consistency in this area. --NAME-- has the natural strength necessary to hold the point, but is best when stunting. --NAME-- is one of the top defensive linemen in this year's draft and is likely to be a high pick that will impact a club in his rookie season.
There isn't much to dislike about --NAME--?s game.  While his quickness is elite, his long range speed is questionable.  Hand use is solid but could use some improvement.
--NAME-- is a highly productive and active player as a 3-technique.  He has a terrific blend of athleticism and power.  Consistently gains penetration against the run and pass with his outstanding quickness and chases down plays with great burst for a big man.

Koa_Misi 496820 40
--NAME-- has good size and strength for the linebacker position. He has played both with his hand in the dirt as well as in a stand up position. He is a tough, hard-nosed competitor that will fit best as an outside linebacker in a 3-4 defense. --NAME-- will need some work reading route progressions and will be a liability in pure man coverage. Wright is an aggressive defender that attacks the line of scrimmage to disrupt the run as well as rush the passer effectively. --NAME-- is a good football player that will take some time to transition into the linebacker position, but should contribute on special teams as well as a backup as a rookie.
Only possesses average coverage skills and has limited experience in this area.  Is more comfortable playing in a crowd, lacks some agility in space and grasps for air on occasion.  Can struggle containing shifty backs on the perimeter.  Is an inconsistent reactor, especially when reading in coverage.

-------------------------
Earl_Mitchell 496822 81
--NAME-- was a productive two-year starter for the Wildcats. He is a short, athletic interior defender who is best when in a stunting mode. His best asset is his initial quickness, which enables him to gain leverage on larger blockers to penetrate the line of scrimmage. He lacks great power to anchor versus double teams but understands angles and plays with good pad level to be effective in most one-on-one situations. He flashes good initial punch, but needs to become more active with his hands to disengage to the ball. --NAME-- flashes as a pass rusher but needs to expand his initial moves and counters to be a consistent contributor at the next level. --NAME-- is a bit of a project with only two years' experience as a defensive tackle after converting from tight end. He could be a versatile player as an interior lineman in an even front while having added value as a possible lead blocker in short-yardage and goal-line situations.
Lacks the bulk to anchor against the run or the length to keep blockers at bay and bat down balls.  Does not show a developed pass-rush package and struggles to consistently get pressure on the quarterback.  Converted offensive lineman who is still learning the nuances of the position.

--NAME-- lacks some power with his initial punch and at the point of attack. He needs to improve his consistency when disengaging and separating versus the run.  We  question his scheme versatility, and he does not appear to be a fit coming off the edge from OLB in a 3-4 or holding up as a 3-4 end.

He shows good initial quickness off the line of scrimmage as an edge rusher with the ability to close well to the quarterback. --NAME-- is a solid reacter who has enough agility and quickness to stand up as an outside 'backer in a 3-4 defensive scheme.

--NAME-- was very productive over the last two seasons at William & Mary, recording more than 20 sacks.  A bit of 'tweener, size wise, he will have make the transition to outside linebacker at the next level.  He is a heady player who does his homework and consistently makes the right reads and flows to the ball.  His non-stop motor makes up for his less-than-elite measurables, but his lack of burst will limit his ability to get to the quarterback in the NFL.  Plays a little high and will get blown out of the play too often. Needs to refine hand placement and technique against bigger and more athletic players.  --NAME-- is a coach's dream as far as effort and preparation are concerned, but his physical limitations make a him a late-round or free-agent prospect.
Small-school DE who lacks ideal height/bulk to play traditional 4-3 end in the NFL.  Loses leverage too often.  Does not show the strength to stack at the line of scrimmage.  Has limited pass rush package and struggles to consistently get after the quarterback.  Has only adequate speed.

He shows natural power to hold the point versus the run as well as push the pocket as a pass rusher. He needs to expand his pass-rush package with more counter moves. He lacks range outside the tackle box and can be inconsistent to shed blockers quickly. --NAME-- will fit best as a nose tackle in a 3-4 defensive scheme with enough tools to develop.
A bit on the short side and will not bat down many passes.  Loses the ball at times and twitches at the line, causing him to lose balance at the snap.

He has adequate size and athleticism for the position with better straight-line speed than change-of-direction and burst in space. Leverages the ball well with good run fits inside-out to the pile. He is a solid open-field tackler, keeping proper body positioning as well as wrapping up on contact. He has a feel for reading route progressions but lacks the agility and quickness to be effective in man coverage. --NAME-- is a good football player with the size, strength and athleticism to develop at the next level, but he likely will only contribute on special teams in his rookie season.
Lacks good lateral agility and burst which prevents him from being a true sideline-to-sideline player.  Loses speed when he changes direction and struggles to keep up with receivers in man coverage.  Does not display good ball skills due to a lack of body control and overall agility.
--NAME-- is strongly built with enough height and good speed.  Follows the ball carrier well and rarely over-pursues.  Solid form tackler who wraps on contact.  Has good instincts and can anticipate route progressions when dropping in pass coverage.  Very productive and durable in the SEC.

He doesn?t have great range in pursuit or speed to the sideline but is very effective between the hashes. --NAME-- is also limited in pure man coverage?s but could be effective in combination zones schemes. His size is a concern at the next level taking on larger blockers and will likely need to be covered up most of the time. He should give valuable depth to the position and contribute on special teams.
--NAME-- lacks some height and bulk we like to see for an inside linebacker.  Long range speed is only adequate.  Durability is a concern as --NAME--?s dealt with injuries during his career.  Doesn?t possess adequate instincts, takes too long to diagnose and can get caught out of position by misdirection players.  His block protection is quesetionable at next level.
--NAME-- is a slightly-undersized, tough, competitive linebacker who has experience playing all three spots in a 4-3.  He flashes the ability to be an explosive tackler, especially inside.  Has some impressive short area quickness and a great motor against the run.

--NAME-- is a big, strong physical defender that missed some time in 2009 after being suspended for a game due to an on the field incident early in the season. --NAME-- is best attacking the line of scrimmage and is a solid tackler in the open field. He uses his hands well to ward off blockers and leverage the ball and understands angles and run fits in the Gators defense.  He is an instinctive player that is best versus the run but appears to have limitations in coverage. --NAME-- is quicker than fast and reacts quickly as plays develop but will need lots of technique work (especially defending the pass) at the next level. --NAME-- has excellent blood lines and is a good football player that brings attitude and leadership to the linebacker position.
Can be overly emotional at times.  --NAME-- only possesses average long- speed which limits his range against the run and ability to play in man coverage, Only has average change of direction in space and can be beaten by counter plays.

-------------------------
Stevenson_Sylvester 496955 166
--NAME-- has been a highly productive player for the Utah defense over the past three seasons. He has a good frame to gain additional bulk and this should help his overall game at the next level. --NAME-- is a high energy defender that has excellent instincts and is rarely out of position. He has some trouble taking on large lineman between the tackles and is best when covered up. --NAME-- does a nice job maintaining leverage with proper angles and hand use to work through traffic. He has better range than his timed speed would indicate and gets to the pile often outside the hashes. --NAME-- has excellent quickness, balance and agility in coverage but needs to improve his ability when in a blitz mode. --NAME-- is an excellent collegiate football player that should eventually start in the NFL.
Only possesses average strength at the point of attack and doesn?t play well in a phone booth.  Needs to expand his pass rush package.  Won?t be able to get to the quarterback on quickness alone at the next level.  Can struggle diagnosing play action at times and get caught out of position.

-------------------------
Nathan_Triplett 496957 167
--NAME-- is a big, strong inside linebacker who started for only one season in college. He was very productive in 2009, but his athleticism and lack of experience is a concern at the next level. He is best between the tackles attacking the line of scrimmage. He doesn't have great quickness, speed or range inside-out to the ball. --NAME-- is inconsistent leveraging the ball in space, and the further away from the line of scrimmage he is, the less effective he becomes. He is an effective inside run blitzer, providing power to push the pocket, but he is a liability as a man-coverage defender. --NAME-- was a good college football player in 2009, but athletic limitations might relegate him to a backup roll in the NFL.
Does not have the speed and lateral agility to consistently make plays outside the tackle box and stick in coverage.  Struggles to locate the ball and takes too many false steps in pursuit.  Lacks a strong punch and the hand technique to quickly shed blocks.  Fails to deliver good shots tackling and does not always wrap.

He has gained 20 pounds over the past year and has a frame to carry additional weight moving forward in the NFL. He is an instinctive player that leverages the ball well and understands angles and run fits in the TCU defensive scheme. --NAME-- is a solid open field tackler and the added bulk has helped his physical presence as a linebacker. He has good range in pursuit and has good lateral quickness and agility to be an effective coverage defender. --NAME-- is a good football player that has been an excellent special teams contributor. He has improved his draft status dramatically by having an outstanding senior season.
Needs added bulk and must improve his power at the point to hold up in the box against the run.  Can be engulfed by bigger blockers that get into his body.  Was only a one-year starter with less playing experience than most prospects.  Despite good instincts, --NAME-- takes initial false steps at times.
--NAME-- possesses good height to add necessary bulk for the inside linebacker position.  He?s a tough, competitive player, with a relentless motor who plays with disregard for his body.  Instinctive performer who quickly diagnoses screens and draws.  Good open field tackler.  Comfortable playing in zone coverage and has the feet to cover backs in man coverage.
-------------------------
Dekoda_Watson 496961 217
--NAME-- was the Seminoles most disruptive defender in 2009 with 13 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks. He needs added weight and strength but shows pop and power when tackling. He is a versatile athlete that has played inside and outside linebacker. --NAME-- reacts well and understands how to maintain leverage on the edge. --NAME-- is best attacking the line of scrimmage and needs technique work and may be a bit of a liability in pure man coverage schemes. --NAME-- is a good football player that will provide depth at linebacker as well as excellent special team?s contributor.

Sean_Weatherspoon 496963 19
--NAME-- is an excellent combination of size, strength and athleticism for the position. He is a tough hard-nosed linebacker that plays with a great motor. --NAME-- is a solid tackler but not a thumper in this area. He runs well and shows good range in pursuit as well as in coverage. --NAME-- leverages the ball well with good angles and proper body positioning. He uses his hands well to ward off blockers and maintain gap responsibility. --NAME-- is an intelligent linebacker that possesses great intangibles that along with physical attributes which should make him a productive player as a rookie.

-------------------------
Jon_Asamoah 496978 68
--NAME-- is a three year starter for the Illini and has the foot agility, body control, and intelligence to play on either side of the center.  He is exceptionally quick into his blocks and has the ability to make reach blocks on opponents playing on his edge.  He is a good knee bender but will allow his pads to get a bit high at times and will overextend at times causing him to struggle when having to recover and right himself against good counter moves.  He is more finesse than powerful or explosive but does show good lower body strength to hunker down and stop the bull rush.
Could afford to put on more bulk.  Will play tall at times and needs to watch his pad level.  Lacks heavy punch in pass protection to really jolt defenders.  Does not react and recover as well as we?d like to see in pass protection.

-------------------------
Zane_Beadles 496980 45
--NAME-- is a four-year starter that played guard in 2006 but has been Utah?s starting left tackle for the past three years.  He will require some re-tooling becuase he is used to playing out of a two point stance and needs to line up with a hand on the ground in the NFL.  He is an adequate athlete that would struggle with the kind of speed coming off the edge in the NFL and needs to move back inside to guard.  He understands angles and blocking schemes and should be a quick study at the next level.
Is a projection prospect who spent the last three years as a tackle out of a two point stance.  --NAME-- lacks top lateral range.  Will let his footwork get sloppy at times.  Is not used to playing with a hand on the ground and needs more experience firing off the ball.

-------------------------
Charles_Brown 496986 64
--NAME-- is a converted tight end that has played on the offensive line for four years at Southern California.  He is an athletic lineman that relies on his foot quickness, agility and ability to recover and sustain blocks more than raw power.  He should get his first shot on the left side thanks to his athleticism and speed and could develop into a quality starter in time.  He does not finish blocks off on a consistent basis and still needs to develop more tenacity and toughness.  --NAME-- is a natural knee bender that does a good job of playing under his pads and on his feet.
Does not have the necessary bulk and will need to gain weight.  Can lunge at defenders and does not have a strong initial surge.  Does not play with a mean streak and is inconsistent finishing off blocks.
--NAME-- has good height and adequate frame.  Has long arms and an effective punch to get inside defenders.  He is athletic with a quick first step and lateral agility.  Bends knees well to gain leverage. Played in a pro scheme and has good instincts for the game.
-------------------------
Bryan_Bulaga 496988 23
--NAME-- is a good, not a great, talent as a left tackle.  Like most Iowa linemen he will come into the league with a good understanding of the game as well as the position he plays.  He understands angles and blocking schemes and is quick to recognize and adjust to games up front.  He is quick to set the edge and knows how to get a good fit with his hands but will struggle when speed rushers transfer that speed into power.  He can be inconsistent with his footwork and is not an elite athlete for the position but there is enough there to make an eventual starter at left tackle.
There are questions about his lower body strength to hold up at the point of attack and drive defenders backwards. --NAME-- can be inconsistent with his footwork when asked to deal with speed rushers or move laterally.  Is not a great knee bender.
--NAME-- has great size and speed for the tackle position.  Displays initial quickness getting back into his pass protection set and off the ball in the running game. Plays with sound technique.  Is a cerebral player.  --NAME--?s really competitive, plays until the whistle and will really finish his blocks.  Productive in college.
-------------------------
Kyle_Calloway 496992 216
--NAME-- is another in a long line of Iowa linemen that should have a long career in the NFL.  He is not the elite athlete that Gallery or Steinbach were but he has enough initial quickness to get out to pick up the edge rusher.  He has excellent hand use and will consistently work to finish his blocks off and has a bit of a nasty temperament on the field.  Enough of a knee bender to stay under his pads and will bring his feet with him to sustain and redirect blocks with movement.  While he has played tackle on both sides as well as some at guard his best position is probably going to be on the right side in the NFL.
Struggles with lateral range and can be exposed by speed rushers. Like other tall players he can be a bit top heavy at times and lose leverage.  Does not have the athleticism to be effective blocking in space.
At nearly 6'7" and 315 pounds --NAME-- has great length and bulk.   Uses his hands very well and possesses good overall technique.  Shows natural feel for the game and proper footwork gives him good leverage.  Versatile enough to play many positions.
-------------------------
Bruce_Campbell 496994 106
--NAME-- is a good sized left tackle prospect that is a bit ahead of the curve, technique wise, over most underclass linemen.  He is quick to set the edge and does a good job of jamming opponents with heavy hands and can be quick to get a refit when the pass rusher slaps his hands away.  He has struggled with durability in that he has yet to play in every game during a collegiate season and will need to be gone over with a fine toothed comb by team doctors.  He gets a bit lazy with his techniques and can be late to recognize or react to new situations but his physical talents are undeniable and he should be quick to come off some team?s draft board.
Durability is a major concern as --NAME-- has dealt with multiple ailments including a brain issue.  Will overextend into blocks and lunge at defenders on occasion.  His instincts are questionable, especially in the running game when moving to the second level.
--NAME-- possesses a rare combination of size and athleticism for an offensive lineman.  Uses hand punch effectively.  Excels in pass protection and can handle speed rushers off the edge.  Does a good job of sustaining his blocks.  Is a competitive performer.  Exhibits impressive initial quickness out of his stance in the running game.
-------------------------
Selvish_Capers 496996 231
--NAME-- is a converted tight end that made the move prior to his sophomore year and has shown steady improvement each year.  While he has the speed and initial quickness to play on the left side, he is probably best suited to play right tackle.  He is an adequate knee bender in pass protection and will let his pad level get a bit high but does play with a good base and often manages to recover in time to ride opponents by the pocket when pass blocking.  Would like to see him finish blocks off more consistently but at least he doesn?t back down from a challenge.  Still needs some work on his blocking angles as well as how quickly he picks up blocks on his own but when he knows what he needs to do he can look decisive.
Does not have the strength to consistently drive defenders off the ball. Fails to attack with a punch and lets defenders engage him.  Plays high and struggles to finish blocks.  Needs to improve his awareness for blocking angles and assignments.
Good height and bulk.  Flashes above-average speed and athletic ability. Quick first step allows him to get to defenders in the open field. Uses long arms in pass protection to move rushers past the pocket.  Maintains body control and balance with a wide base.
-------------------------
Erik_Cook 497000 229
--NAME-- has been a quality offensive lineman for the Lobos over the past three years and has started at all three positions: tackle, guard and center.  He may be a little tall for the center position as he would be facing a lot of nose tackles that would have a natural leverage advantage on him.  He is a natural knee bender that does a good job of playing with a good pad level and will leverage his blocks.  He can struggle when opponents get to, or past, the edge and he needs to recover and square back up on the block.  He lacks the lateral range to play on the edge and is best suited to play guard or center where he has the potential to eventually develop into an adequate starter.
Lacks lateral range in pass protection and will be exposed on the perimeter by speedy edge rushers.  Limited fluidity makes him a liability on the move and in open spaces.  Struggles to recover when he loses position or balance.  Does not show a mean streak and finish blocks.  Inconsistent recognizing blitzes.
--NAME-- is thickly built with a wide frame.  Uses his hands well to get inside and lock onto defenders.  Possesses a quick first step and takes very good angles in run blocking.  Sinks hips to get under the defender?s pads and uses his strong lower body to generate a good push.  Prepares well and has a very good understanding of pass protection.
-------------------------
Anthony_Davis 497002 11
--NAME-- is a prototypical left tackle in that he is a good foot athlete and has bulk as well as long arms that allow him to get a fit and control opponents as he steers them on by the pocket.  He is not a natural knee bender and will let his pads get too far forward as he extends to sustain his blocks.  He can slide and shuffle with an edge rusher and has the body control and foot agility to react and adjust to counter moves.  He has shown a tendency to gain too much weight and will need to be monitored.  He has strong hands and upper body and can swallow opponents up on the run block but does not finish his blocks off as much as he could.  He will need some time to develop but could end up as a starting left tackle in a couple of years.
Lacks great initial quickness when exploding out of his stance in the running game.  --NAME-- is not a natural knee bender.  Would like to see him finish strong on a more consistent basis.  His self discipline is questionable after he struggled with weight issues in college.
--NAME-- has the outstanding combination of size and athleticism necessary to play left tackle at the next level.  Displays impressive strength eating up opponents off the ball.  Excels in pass protection utilizing his long arms to effectively react and adjust while protecting the blindside.  Displays really nice hand use.
-------------------------
Chris_Degeare 497004 161
DeGeare is a physically gifted lineman who has struggled with the mental aspects of the game as well as college.  He missed the 2008 season by being academically ineligible and is not aware of twists, stunts and games up front by the defensive linemen.  He can be quick out of his stance but often ends up getting behind on blocks because he is late to react to movement.  He appears to wear down during the course of most games and may need to loose some weight in order to improve his conditioning.
Does not have the endurance to give a consistent effort and carries too much bad weight.  Fails to recognize stunts and blitzes and is generally late identifying his assignment.  Shows inconsistent technique and does not use his hands well to get inside the defender's pads.
DeGeare is a huge guard with more than adequate height.  Has a quick first step and engages fast.  Strong run blocker who generates a good push and drives his man off the ball.  Maintains a wide base and is stout against the bull rush.
-------------------------
Vlad_Ducasse 497006 61
--NAME-- is a three-year starter at tackle that translates inside to guard for the next level.  He came to the U.S. from Haiti in 2002 and that was his first exposure to playing the game of football.  He is very athletic for his size with foot quickness, agility and body control but due to his limited experience he often takes poor angles and is not always very quick to recognize stunts and twists by the defensive front.  When he has no doubt as to what he is supposed to do, --NAME-- looks dominating and powerful.  While he is not apt to be an instant impact player, --NAME-- has a chance to become a quality starter due to his size, power and athleticism.
Originally from Haiti, --NAME-- has a limited football background.  Does not possess adequate instincts at this time and can be caught thinking on the move.  Must do a better job of finishing his blocks and driving until the whistle.  Needs to work on taking better blocking angles.
--NAME-- has a really nice combination of size, natural power and foot agility for an offensive lineman.  Exhibits good initial quickness exploding out of his stance in the running game and getting set in pass protection.  Plays with really nice leverage.
-------------------------
Jason_Fox 497008 128
While --NAME-- has been a starter for four years at both right and left tackle his foot agility and lateral range may be on the marginal side for a left tackle in the NFL.  He is a tough athlete that has proven his willingness to play with pain. He still needs improvement in his temperament on the field.  He does not always finish blocks off or look to punish opponents as often as he could.  --NAME--?s status may drop some in the draft as he will need rehab on an injured knee that he was playing with during his senior season.  He is not a natural knee bender and will play with his pads too high at times.
Lacks good lateral range. Does not finish blocks and struggles to bend his knees to gain leverage.  Takes false steps and forgets blocking assignments in the second level.  Does not get necessary push and has inconsistent hand technique.
Big and tall with long arms. Four year starter who understands pass protection.  Possesses good footwork and body control.  Athletic enough to engage quicker edge rushers.  Uses quickness and speed to pull in the running game. Shows a mean streak.
-------------------------
Joe_Hawley 497012 117
--NAME-- is a good college interior lineman but lacks any singular asset that makes you think he eventually can become a starter at the next level. He started at both guard and center while at UNLV and understands blocking schemes and angles. He is not a natural knee-bender and struggles to leverage blocks, which allows him to be overpowered by massive nose tackles and three-technique tackles. He gets a good fit with his hands but lacks the heavy hands that can shock opponents and get them back on their heels. He projects as a quality free agent or late-round draft pick.
Loses leverage since he is not a natural knee bender and will struggle to handle the bull rush at the next level. Does not have the pure strength to push people around in the run game and lacks a strong punch to shock defenders. Takes too many false steps and struggles to fight off counter moves in pass protection.
Big-bodied kid with adequate height. Fires off the ball low, takes proper angles and engages with his hands, getting inside the defender's pads.  Possesses good speed for his size to get to the edge when pulling. Heady player who  understands interior blocking assignments and can play both guard and center.
-------------------------
Mike_Iupati 497016 17
--NAME-- is a massive guard that started three years at Idaho although he did miss some time in 2008 after dealing with offseason shoulder surgery.  He is one of the more powerful blockers in the draft and once he gets his hands on opponents it?s pretty much all over.  --NAME-- was born in American Samoa and English is not his native language which can slow down his progress when it comes to learning new schemes and the playbook.  While it may take --NAME-- a bit longer to develop into a front line player, he could have a long and productive career once he settles in.
Lacks adequate speed for the guard position.  Must improve his instincts for the game and get better dealing with complex defensive line play.  Because of sub-par speed, downfield blocking needs to get better.  Struggles to get to the second level in the running game.
--NAME-- has terrific size for an interior blocker.  Plays with a lot of toughness and tenacity.  Exhibits outstanding power in the running game and in pass protection.  Has very good body control and balance.  Possesses great short area quickness and really jolts defenders.  Appears to have heavy hands in pass protection.
-------------------------
John_Jerry 497018 73
--NAME-- is a massive lineman that moved to tackle for his senior year at "Ole Miss" but will need to move back inside to guard for the next level.  He can engulf and overpower opponents once he gets his hands on them but can also struggle against speed when playing on the edge.  He is not a natural knee bender and tends to let his pad level get too high on a lot of blocks.  He is more of a mauler and brawler than an explosive blocker and knocks opponents off the ball.  He could stand to lose some weight if he wants to become a full-time player at the next level.
Lacks adequate agility and lateral range making him susceptible to a speed/quick pass rusher with counter moves.  Struggles blocking in the open field.  Lacks the endurance to be consistently dominant during long drives.  Needs to watch his pad level.  Does not physically dominate as much as we?d like to see given his size.
--NAME-- possesses great size and rare bulk for an offensive lineman.  Has long arms, making him even more difficult for pass rushers to navigate around.  Has really good natural strength.  Can be an effective run blocker due to size.  Has some impressive short area quickness for a big man.
-------------------------
Mike_Johnson 497020 98
--NAME-- is an all day sucker that, while he doesn?t dominate or punish opponents, simply knows how to get the job done.  He has played and started at both guard positions as well as both tackle positions while at Alabama.  He understands angles as well as his limitations and does an excellent job of not letting himself get into situations that expose his weaknesses.  He lacks top sand in his lower body and can be driven back into the pocket by powerful interior defensive linemen.  He is the kind of player that finds a way to become productive blockers at the next level.
Lacks great sand in lower body and can be overpowered in pass protection against the bull rush.  Does not have great foot agility and range and isn?t always comfortable getting out and blocking in space.  Is not a punishing blocker who will dominate at the point of attack.
--NAME-- has size and enough height to add some more weight.  Possesses outstanding football intelligence.  Displays the position versatility to play either guard spot or tackle.  Has long arms.  Was a three year starter at a major program and part of one of the nation?s top running games as a senior.
-------------------------
Ted_Larsen 497026 205
--NAME-- was a three-year defensive lineman who moved to center for his final two years at State.  He is a good athlete for the position with initial quickness and above-average lateral range in pass pro.  He needs work on leveraging his blocks in spite of having natural leverage angles due to his size and still needs to improve his instincts when it comes to picking up stunts and twists up front.  A lot of his issues can be improved with time at the position, and he should provide a team with a good backup for a year or two as he develops his instincts and techniques.
Converted defensive lineman who is still learning the position. Gets confused by stunts and twists in the defensive line and misses assignments on blitzes. Lunges at times due to overextension and loses leverage on run blocks too often.  Lacks the versatility to contribute at guard at the next level.
Thickly built kid with good athleticism for the position.  Has a quick first step and the strength to generate a push in the running game.  Possesses nimble feet and mirrors rushers in pass protection.  Plays with a bit of a mean streak and looks to punish opponents.
-------------------------
Marshall_Newhouse 497030 169
--NAME-- comes from a strong football family but does not show the kind of instincts and mental awareness than you'd expect from someone with that kind of background.  As long as the defensive front plays pretty vanilla in terms of stunts and twists, he shows no hesitations or indecision, but he can be late to react and adjust when he sees something for the first time.  He shows good initial quickness and speed but struggles when he has to adjust on the move or react to counter moves.  He was a quality starter at left tackle for the past three years at TCU but will probably find a better fit inside at guard at the next level.
Lacks the lateral agility to make blocks in space and struggles to get into position after counter moves.  Does not consistently recognize stunts and blitzes and misses his blocking assignments too often.  Lacks a mean streak and does not always finish blocks.
--NAME-- is tall enough with a thick build. Has a good first step and the speed to make blocks at the second level. Maintains a wide base and uses his hands to push edge rushers past the pocket. Three-year starter at TCU.
-------------------------
Russell_Okung 497032 6
--NAME-- is a prototypical left tackle in that he has rare size and long arms that allow him to control and steer pass rushers on by the pocket.  He shows excellent balance and body control but will occasionally overextend or reach for the block which keeps him from sustaining blocks as long as he could.  --NAME-- should be an early draft pick on the offensive line and has the body type that teams are looking for when it comes to protecting the blind side.
--NAME-- does not have many holes in his game.  At 6'8" he will play tall at times and his height makes it difficult to always keep low and change directions laterally against quicker defenders.
--NAME-- possesses prototypical size for a left tackle.  Has started at tackle since his true freshman season.  Maintains great balance with almost elite feet.  Neutralizes the speed rush by setting fast. Shows a mean streak which helps in the running game.  Engages defenders with long arms and has the straight-line speed to get to the second level.
-------------------------
Eric_Olsen 497034 183
--NAME-- is a good college center with excellent size, strength and technique.  He works his blocks hard and will fight from snap to whistle to get the job done.  He does a good job of getting a fit with his hands to control and steer opponents but does not always bring his feet with him when reacting to movement.  He is not real nimble or quick getting to the second level when on the back side and is not real effective when blocking in space.  He is not a natural knee-bender and struggles to keep his pad level down to leverage his blocks.  He has a chance on size, competitiveness and intelligence but lacks the physical tools to be a front-line player.
Keeps his pads too high and loses leverage, because he is not a natural knee-bender. Lacks initial quickness to shock defenders and does not have the agility to be effective in space.  Has inconsistent balance and forgets to move his feet underneath him at times.
Tall interior lineman with great bulk.  Gets his hands inside defenders' pads and has the strength to generate a good push.  Has a bit of a mean streak and fights to the end of the whistle every snap.  Heady player who knows his blocking assignments and takes good angles.
-------------------------
Mitch_Petrus 497040 147
--NAME-- is a two-year starter at guard after spending time at tight end as well as fullback.  He missed the 2008 season due to academic suspension due to a change in majors and falling short of academic eligibility requirements.  He is still learning the position but shows enough raw talent and athleticism to make you think he has a chance to be a quality starter with work and practice.  He shows excellent body control and balance in his blocks and is a natural knee bender that can leverage his blocks against bigger opponents.  His hand use improved during his senior season and could become a strength as he gets more comfortable with techniques.
Does not possesses the power we?d like to see.  Lacks the run blocking strength to blow defenders off the ball.  Needs to improve his feel for angles and blocking schemes which could come with more experience.  His hand use could use some refinement.
--NAME-- shows some impressive initial quickness firing off the ball and getting back into his pass protection set.  Has the straight line speed, balance and body control and foot agility necessary to pull and lead out on the perimeter and block at the second level. Is a good knee bender.
-------------------------
Maurkice_Pouncey 497042 18
--NAME-- is a versatile lineman that has lined up at both center and guard.  He is a squatty, quick-footed athlete that can roll his hips to redirect and adjust to movement or sink his hips to hunker down against a powerful bull rush by big nose tackles.  He is quick with his first step after the snap and quick to get a fit with his hands but will let his weight get too far forward at times.  --NAME-- had surgery to repair a torn labrum in his shoulder in May of 2009 and durability could become a concern down the road.  He should be quick to see the playing field thanks to his versatility.
Not too many holes in his game.  Durability is a concern after --NAME-- underwent torn labrum surgery.  Could benefit from playing with a higher degree of tenacity.  We?d like to see him more consistently finish off his blocks and fight until the whistle.
--NAME-- has the size and quickness we look for in an interior offensive lineman.  Has the versatility to play both center and guard.  Exhibits great awareness and can handle complex defensive line play.  Really active.  Displays impressive body control and balance when getting out in front in the running game.  Plays with good leverage.
-------------------------
Rodger_Saffold 497048 33
--NAME-- is a good collegiate lineman who started at left tackle for three consecutive years at Indiana.  He lacks the massive stature that teams are looking for in a left tackle and may be lacking a step in quickness to play on the left side but should be able to find a home on the right side or even inside at guard.  He has above-average initial quickness and does a good job of getting a fit with his hands to control and steer opponents on by the hole or pocket.  He understands blocking angles and does a good job of recognizing stunts and twists up front and keeps his head on a swivel when in pass pro.  While he doesn't really jump off the screen at you, the end result is that he consistently gets the job done and often makes it look pretty easy.
Frame is not wide enough to play left tackle in the NFL.  Does not have the power to be a road grader in the running game.  Lacks the lateral range in pass protection to neutralize edge rushers.  Not athletic enough to make blocks in space at the second level and will struggle to pull if he makes the move to guard.
--NAME-- is tall with good bulk.  Has a quick first step and engages with his hands to get inside defenders.  Takes precise blocking angles in the running game and gets leverage to steer defenders out of lanes.  Displays good awareness dropping back in pass protection and consistently picks up his blocking assignment.
-------------------------
Chris_Scott 497050 151
--NAME-- has played a lot of football at Tennessee as a starting left tackle, but he lacks the lateral range and foot agility to play on the left side at the next level.  He is a powerful blocker who generally wins the battle once he gets his hands on opponents and can simply engulf or smother ends when blocking down for the run.  He is quick to read blocking schemes and takes good angles to get to where he needs to be, but he will struggle when he needs to recover and right himself against good movement by defensive ends. He has enough going for him to eventually become a starter on the right side but will need some work on his footwork.
Lacks the lateral range in pass protection to stay with more athletic edge rushers.  Footwork is inconsistent, and he takes too many false steps.  Does not have the hip fluidity and agility to be an effective blocker in space.  Struggles to recover and right himself when he gets in trouble.
Thickly built player with great height.  Gets his hands inside defenders and has a strong punch.  Reads fast and takes proper angles.  Has the strength be a road-grader in the running game.  Finishes blocks and shows a mean streak.  Played extensively in the SEC.
-------------------------
Matt_Tennant 497054 158
--NAME-- is a three-year starter for the Eagles that has become an excellent technician that knows angles and how to use his hands to control and steer opponents.  He is quick into blocks after the exchange and does a good job of moving his feet and adjusting to movement but lacks the raw power and lower body strength to dominate like the elite centers.  He does a good job of finishing his blocks off when he can and goes from snap to whistle.  He still needs to fill out his frame but will probably never be an overpowering blocker at the next level.
Has a good frame but lacks good bulk for the position.  Does not possess the power to consistently deal with the bull rush when pass blocking or blow interior lineman off the ball in the running game.  Is not a great knee bender.
--NAME-- possesses a nice blend of size and athleticism.  Displays impressive initial quickness and agility to reach his blocks at the second level.  Is a real technician with great field awareness.  Exhibits good hand use and gets his arms extended and locked.  Body control and balance are also impressive.
-------------------------
Ed_Wang 497066 140
--NAME-- is a second generation Chinese-American whose parents were Olympians for the Chinese Olympic team in the ?70s.  He is a starting left tackle for a major college program and is still learning the finer points of playing on the offensive line after moving from the tight end position in 2006.  He has good initial quickness as well as downfield speed but is not a natural knee bender and tends to let his pad level get too high.  He can be inconsistent in his blocking angles and does not finish his blocks off as well as you?d like.
Too quick to help out guards when not engaged.  Does not have the lower body strength to consistently drive defenders off the ball.  Stands up too tall and takes too many false steps. Does not play with enough of an edge and finish blocks.
--NAME-- has great size and bulk. Two year starter at left tackle that does a good job of locking his arms out and riding rushers past the pocket.  Has great speed and foot quickness which helps him set quickly.  Changes direction well.
-------------------------
Thomas_Welch 497071 208
--NAME-- is a fifth-year senior who came to Vanderbilt as a tight end but was moved to the offensive line before the 2007 season and became a starter at right tackle during the 2008 season.  He moved to the left side for his senior year and put together a nice final season.  He is an adequate athlete for the position but lacks the kind of initial quickness, agility and lateral range to play on the left side at the next level.  He is still learning the nuances of the offensive line and will need a few seasons, probably as a practice-squad member, to get it all figured out.  He is not a natural knee-bender and tends to lunge out after blocks and generally goes to the ground too often.  He struggles when trying to mirror better edge rushers at this level and will need to move back to the right side if he has any chance to make it in the NFL.  When things go according to plan, he appears comfortable and confident, but when faced with something he hasn't seen in practice, he can look lost.
--NAME-- lacks the initial quickness to consistently get inside the defender's pads and drop quickly against an edge rusher.  Does not possess the lateral agility to make blocks in space and play left tackle at the next level.  Not a natural knee-bender; tends to lose his balance and lunge at opponents.  A converted tight end who gets confused by stunts and blitzes at times.
--NAME-- has prototypical size and very good length.  Solid athlete who has some versatility after playing tight end and both tackle positions in college.  High-effort kid who shows a bit of a mean streak and fights to the whistle every play.
-------------------------
Trent_Williams 497073 4
--NAME-- is an intense run blocker that played on the left side his senior year but will find a better fit as a right tackle at the next level.  He has good size, but could still add quite a bit of bulk after a few years in the NFL.  He does a good job of playing over his feet on run blocks which allows him to sustain blocks and redirect with movement.  Once he smells blood he will drive opponents into the ground.  As a pass blocker he shows good technique but lacks the top lateral range to stay with premier pass rushers coming off the edge.
Needs to fill out his frame or will struggle with the bull rush at the next level. Feet are only above average and he may have limited range in pass protection.  Does not always take proper angles when run blocking.
--NAME-- has great height and a wide enough frame to support more bulk.  Plays angry and finishes blocks.  Strong enough to push defenders.  Sets feet quickly and can slide with athletic d-lineman.  Hits hard and establishes great position run blocking. Three-year starter with solid feel and instincts.
-------------------------
Sam_Young 497075 179
--NAME-- was a blue chip prospect, out of Florida, that became an instant starter his freshman year and has been a mainstay on the offensive line for the Irish.  He is a massive blocker with long arms that can simply engulf opponents once he gets his hands on them.  He lacks top initial quickness and can be beaten off the edge by explosive edge rushers.  While he has started at both left tackle and on the right side he is best suited to be a right tackle in the NFL.
Struggles to get a consistent push.  Marginal speed and instincts limit effectiveness run blocking.  Not a natural knee bender that sometimes gets driven back. Plays hard but does not always finish blocks.  Does not make the right decisions on downfield blocks.
Ideal height and bulk.  Massive size makes him stout against the bull rush. Long arms allow him to ride edge rushers past the pocket.  Sets quickly, has good feet and plays with a wide base.  Has experience in a pro-style offense.
-------------------------
Brent_Bowden 497077 172
--NAME-- has good size and athleticism for the position. He had his most productive season in 2009, averaging 43.8 yards per attempt and showing excellent ability to drop the ball inside the 20-yard line. --NAME-- is a self made punter that had to sit for a couple of seasons before securing the starting position. His mechanics are solid but he needs to continue to improve his overall consistency at the next level. --NAME-- has the tools to develop into a solid punter in the league but doesn?t have elite talent to be an impact player as a punter.
--NAME-- could afford to have more consistency with hang time and distance.  Has less experience than other punters after sitting out early in his career.
--NAME-- is a well-built punter with impressive size.  Has displayed great leg strength on his punts.  Known to have a good work ethic.  Punts with poise and confidence. Mechanics are good but could use a little more polish.  Can coffin-corner.
-------------------------
Matt_Dodge 497079 221
--NAME-- was a productive, three-year starter for the Pirates. He has above-average size and strength for the position. He doesn't have elite leg strength but can drive the ball at times. However, he can be slow with his get-off times. His mechanics can be inconsistent, which affects his overall production as a punter. --NAME-- is adept at dropping the ball inside the 20-yard line and appears to have the raw talent to develop his overall skills. He has shown some versatility with the ability to kick off, and this should improve his stock in this year's draft.
Lacks ideal leg extension, which limits his ability to boom the ball. Sloppy mechanics result in inconsistent punts, and he takes too long getting the ball off, which may lead to blocks at the next level. Struggles to consistently get good hang time and punts too many line drives past his coverage.
--NAME-- has adequate size and athleticism to make tackles in punt coverage at the next level. Possesses an accurate leg and shows the ability to trap opponents inside the 20-yard line. Versatile punter who can kick off and make some field goals in a pinch.
-------------------------
Zoltan_Mesko 497083 150
--NAME-- is a four-year starter that had his best season punting the football in 2009. He averaged 44.5 yards in 52 attempts with 0 blocked. --NAME-- is excellent at dropping the ball inside the twenty yard line to pin opponents deep into their own territory. --NAME-- has good size and athleticism for the position with above average leg strength. --NAME-- has been effective in tough weather conditions and shows poise under pressure.

-------------------------
Sam_Bradford 497095 1
--NAME-- won the Heisman Trophy as a redshirt sophomore in 2008 and then decided after his junior year to come out early.  He missed most of the season after injuring and then re-injuring his shoulder which required surgery to repair in October of 2009.  He has won a lot of games between his years at Oklahoma as well as during high school.  He can be extremely accurate in the short to intermediate passing game and will flash the ability to time his throws leading his receivers so that they can catch the ball in stride when going downfield.  While he may need a year or two to develop into a starting quarterback, he does have a tremendous upside.
Coming off shoulder injury on his throwing arm.  Needs to add bulk to withstand the pounding at the next level.  Uses a three-quarter delivery that may lead to batted balls.  Has a tendency to hold on to the ball too long.
--NAME-- has ideal height and good mobility.  Exceptionally accurate with a quick release.  Possesses great balance and steps into his throws.

Extremely productive and successful in college.
-------------------------
Levi_Brown 497097 209
--NAME-- is a raw, physical talent who has a relatively strong arm and can get the ball out quickly and accurately but will need a lot of work before he is ready for the next level of football.  He has played from a spread offense and will need a lot of work to make the transition to a traditional, pro passing attack.  He is not real quick to drop in the pocket, and his accuracy can suffer when he tries to throw on the move.  He is not quick or fast enough to buy time when flushed out of the pocket and is not apt to scramble for positive yards very often.
Played in a spread offense in college, struggles with his drops and will need to learn to make progressions at the next level.  Does not have the speed to make plays with his feet when the pocket collapses.  Limited lateral agility prevents him from making pass rushers miss, and he will take a lot of sacks.  Lacks the necessary accuracy with his deep ball.
--NAME-- has prototypical size and does not get flustered in the pocket.  Gets the ball out fast and is very accurate on underneath routes.  Steps into his throws and generates good RPMs on his balls.  Two-year starter who was very productive in college.
-------------------------
Sean_Canfield 497104 239
--NAME-- was a highly touted high school quarterback who never seemed to reach his potential until he was asked to fill in for starter Lyle Moevao during his senior season.  He has prototypical NFL size and release but has always struggled to come up big when under pressure.  He does a good job of reading coverages and making pre-snap reads but can struggle when things break down and he needs to improvise or make plays on the move.  He has enough of an arm to make most of the throws needed in the NFL but lacks the cannon needed to hit small windows or hit receivers in stride on the deep outs.  He has enough going for him to give him a chance to be drafted in the later rounds or sign with a team as a priority free agent.
Lacks adequate arm strength and will be unable to make all the throws at the next level.  Does not have the speed or athleticism to evade more athletic pass rushers and is not a threat to pick up yards on the ground.  Struggles to make good decisions when things break down.
--NAME-- is tall with adequate bulk.  Possesses a quick release and is a bit of a lefty dart thrower who fits the ball into tight spaces on underneath routes.  Does his homework, understands coverage and makes good pre-snap reads.  High-character kid who was very productive as a senior.
-------------------------
Jimmy_Clausen 497108 48
--NAME-- has been the face of the Notre Dame program for the past three years and has shown improvement in virtually every aspect of his game each year.  He lacks a cannon for an arm but he does have a live arm and a quick delivery that allows him to get the ball out quickly.  He has close to a '-arm delivery which coupled with his lack of top height can cause some of his passes to get knocked down or tipped by pass rushers.  He has been well coached and understands a pro style offense, so he is apt to come to camp better prepared than most. He is recovering from toe surgery and will not participate in combine drills.
--NAME-- has a somewhat low release point.  Release point combined with less-than-ideal height leaves --NAME-- susceptible to having passes batted down at the line.  Has a strong arm but lacks premier arm strength and may struggle at times fitting the ball into windows deep down the field. He will be unable to participate in combine drills due to toe surgery.
--NAME--?s a highly-competitive signal-caller who was has been very productive in a pro-style system during his career.  Possesses a live arm and flashes the ability to make all the NFL throws.  Displays impressive accuracy in the short passing game.  Is athletic and mobile for the position and can avoid the rush and make plays outside the pocket.  Has a very quick delivery.
-------------------------
Armanti_Edwards 497110 89
--NAME-- is a four-year starter that led his team to two national titles as well as a playoff run in the other two seasons.  He is an undersized quarterback that will need to be projected to another position to take advantage of his speed, quickness and athleticism.  He has had some durability issues and will need to bulk up if he wants to play at the next level.  He is explosive and can force defenders to grab nothing but air with his elusiveness and cutting ability.  He will require some time to learn how to run routes and to control his speed so he can give defenders different looks as he runs his routes.
--NAME-- is undersized as a quarterback and at other potential positions at the next level.  Struggled with his accuracy.  If he was to remain under center, pro-style quarterback skills would need quite a bit of work.  Is a pure projection prospect, who will have no position-specific game experience if asked to switch from quarterback.
--NAME-- is a proven winner at the Football Championship Subdivision level of competition as a quarterback who will likely need to make a living elsewhere in the NFL.  Can?t argue with his production.  Has impressive speed and athleticism and can make defenders miss in the open field.
-------------------------
Mike_Kafka 497117 122
--NAME-- rebounded for a nice senior season after being bounced around and showing a lot of inconsistencies during his first three years.  He is a touch passer that relies on timing and accuracy with the short throws to get the job done. He has marginal arm strength and needs room to step into his throws in order to get any zip on the ball.  He generally takes the snap from the shotgun formation and will need his share of time to learn how to go under center, take the snap and drop to the pocket.  He is a smart quarterback that can read coverages and go through his progressions but has too many physical limitations to be considered more than a backup.
--NAME-- doesn?t have the speed to be considered a threat in the open field.  Struggled to perform at a consistently high level early in his career.  Lacks experience in a pro-style system after spending most of his time from the shotgun in the spread.  Does not possess the necessary arm strength to hit the deep out or push the ball down the field against defenses at the next level.
--NAME-- possesses nice size to scan the field.  Is an accurate passer who exhibits nice touch on underneath routes.  Shows a good sense of timing.  Can work through multiple progressions and understands route combination concepts.  Can improvise.
-------------------------
Dan_LeFevour 497119 181
--NAME-- is a four-year starter at a mid level college football program that flashes a lot of what teams are looking for but will need to develop several parts of his game if he wants to play at the next level.  He does not take many snaps from under center and will need to work on dropping to the pocket and reading the coverage as he sets up.  He has a decent arm but the ball will flutter, at times, when trying to thread the needle on some downfield throws.  When he has time and room to step into his throws he can get some zip on the short to intermediate outs.
Spent most of his time in the spread and must gain experience taking the snap from under center.  Needs improvement and more consistency throwing the deep ball.  Must avoid locking onto receivers and become better at looking defenders off.  Does not have the speed to be a threat to pickup yardage with his legs.
--NAME-- is high-character player and fierce competitor.  Was extremely productive at the non-BCS level.  Plays with very impressive intelligence and is a good decision maker.  Possesses the release quickness you look for at the next level.  Has the arm strength necessary to make most NFL throws.  Exhibits very good accuracy in the short passing game.
-------------------------
Colt_McCoy 497123 85
--NAME-- is a once in a lifetime college quarterback.  He has done everything right while at Texas and has done a great job of representing the university on and off the field.  Unfortunately his skills don?t translate to his being a lock to make it big at the next level.  He has an adequate arm but can struggle when needing to throw a dart on the intermediate to deep outs and the ball will float on him at times when deep passes down the seam.  He understands the game and does a good job of reading coverages and making good decisions before and after the snap.  He is athletic and has done a wonderful job of hitting the weights to improve his physical stature.
--NAME-- lacks a cannon for an arm.  Can fit the ball into spots on intermediate routes at times but will struggle with the deep ball.  Release point is a little low.  Needs to improve his accuracy on long passes down the field and toward the sideline.
--NAME-- is a natural leader with high character.  Played with a lot of intelligence in Texas? system which he mastered.  Was extremely productive.  Possesses a quick release.  Displays great accuracy in the short passing game and puts the ball in a position to set up his receivers for run after the catch.  Has the foot-speed to avoid the rush and buy extra time.
-------------------------
Tony_Pike 497125 204
--NAME-- is a bit of a product of the system that has been in place with the Cincinnati Bearcats.  He gets a lot of completions due to their dink and dunk passing attack that spreads the field out and relies primarily on their passing game to move the ball.  He knows how to read coverages but will get stuck on his primary receiver at times rather than go to his second or third option.  He is effective throwing from the pocket or when rolling to his right but will struggle when rolling left and having to throw back against the grain.  He has struggled to stay healthy for a full season in college and will need to bulk up if he wants to survive the rigors of a full NFL season.
Lacks the necessary bulk to withstand a pounding at the next level.  Has been injured and durability is a concern.  Earned his living underneath in college and does not possess prototypical arm strength to drive the ball downfield on the deep out.  Lacks the speed to pickup chunks of yardage with his feet.
--NAME-- has good character and has battled back from injuries.  Has ideal height to scan the field and does a good job working through his progressions and reading coverages.  Very accurate in the short, underneath passing game.  Was very productive playing in a spread offense in college.  Shows very good touch and feel.
-------------------------
Zac_Robinson 497127 250
--NAME-- is a two-year starter that has shown the ability to lead his team and put points on the scoreboard, but is not a classic pocket passer that can make all the throws needed for the next level.  He has adequate arm strength but compensates with a live arm that allows him to get the ball out quickly and does not give defenders a lot of time to get a jump on his throws.  He needs work on going through his progressions and looking defenders off and will force too many passes causing more interceptions than he should throw.  He is athletic and can extend the pocket or throw the ball on the move but will likely never be more than a second or third quarterback on an NFL team.
Has adequate height but does not possess enough bulk for the next level.  Arm strength is good but raw.  Throwing mechanics could use some polish as he can take too long to deliver the ball at times.  Not very experienced reading coverages in a pro-style system.   Will get locked into a single receiver.
--NAME-- is a high-character player.  Exhibits impressive mental toughness in terms of preparation off the field and grit on the field.  Displays a live arm at times to make difficult throws.  Is very accurate in the short passing game.  --NAME--?s an athletic signal-caller, who can avoid the pass rush, scramble to buy extra time and pick up yardage with his feet.
-------------------------
John_Skelton 497129 155
--NAME-- is a good-sized quarterback with a major league arm.  The problem is that he does not know how to use his arm to his advantage.  He tends to rely on arm strength alone, when throwing the ball and does not do a good job of getting his feet set under him when throwing from the pocket.  He can throw on the move, but his accuracy suffers a lot.  He will need a ton of work when it comes to reading NFL coverages and going through his progressions as he looks for the best target.  Teams may get too enamored with his arm strength and overlook how much development it will take before he is ready to play.
Does not always set his feet when he throws, which results in a lot of errant passes.  Overconfident in his arm strength and forces too many throws.  Struggles reading coverage and does not show the ability to consistently find his second and third options.  Played at the Division 1AA level and will have a steep learning curve.
--NAME-- possesses prototypical height and bulk.  Has excellent arm strength to make all the NFL throws.  Generates great zip on the ball and can fit it into tight spots.  Fluid athlete who  avoids the rush and gains positive yards scrambling when receivers are covered.
-------------------------
Tim_Tebow 497135 25
--NAME-- is arguably one of the best college quarterbacks of all time.  He has won a lot of games over the years as he is a perfect fit for Urban Meyer?s offensive system.  He will need a lot of retraining when he gets to an NFL camp as he plays out of the shotgun formation and will need a lot of work on dropping from center and setting up in the pocket while reading coverage schemes.  He has a strong arm but his accuracy has been inconsistent over the years as he often ends up throwing the ball when on the move.  He is not generally real quick to pull the trigger once he decides where he wants to throw the ball.
--NAME-- really struggles with his accuracy.  Release is far to slow to fit balls into spots against NFL defensive backs.  Release point and mechanics (elongated, wind-mill delivery which comes out too low) likely need to be altered.  Was not asked to run through pro-style progressions and struggled reading defenses, especially those with NFL concepts, in college.
--NAME-- has the size and bulk to hold up at the next level.  Is a highly-competitive player.  Exhibits rare character on and off the field.  Is athletic enough to pick up tough yards with his legs.  Was extremely productive in college.  Possesses very good arm strength.  Is a winning football player.
-------------------------
Jahvid_Best 497147 30
--NAME-- is an explosive ball carrier that has the speed to turn a missed tackle into a long touchdown run.  He has been productive as a runner as well as a return specialist.  He missed the final four games of the 2009 season after sustaining a concussion and sore lower back in the game against Oregon State (11/7/2009).  He is a patient runner that does a good job of setting up his blocks and squeezing through small run lanes.  He has an explosive burst through the hole and has enough power and leg strength to run through arm tackles but is not big, or powerful enough to move piles.  He shows good balance on contact and will fight for yards.
--NAME-- lacks the prototypical size of an every down NFL running back.  Does not have the strength to consistently break tackles or push the pile.  Durability is a real concern after missing time due to various ailments throughout career.  Is not a power runner.  Will need to improve his blocking ability in the passing game.
--NAME--?s game is all about speed, quickness, acceleration and elusiveness making him a home run threat from the running back position.  Is a high-character guy, who will compete and fight for extra yards despite size.  Does a good job reading his blocks, shows patience and can find the cutback lane.  Very dangerous open field runner.  Exhibits solid receiving skills.
-------------------------
John_Conner 497168 139
--NAME-- is a bit of a throwback fullback who is an aggressive blocker and a strong inside runner.  He is not very effective when trying to run outside the tackles and lacks the speed to hit on many long runs.  He can unload on linebackers when lead blocking up into the hole and has enough power and explosion to clear out a lane but does not do a great job of bringing his feet with him after contact. Needs work on adjusting on the move to pick up the blitz when he stays in for pass protection.  He has been a quality special-teams performer and should see action on coverage units as he learns the techniques that need improving.
--NAME-- is not fast enough to be an outside runner and sometimes is a bit late getting to the edge as a lead blocker.  Sloppy footwork causes him to struggle to make blocks in pass protection.  Does not have good hands, runs imprecise routes and lacks the ability to be a consistent check-down option in the passing game.
--NAME-- has a thick, muscular build and a low center of gravity.  Strong lower half allows him to push the pile in short-yardage situations.  Delivers good shots blocking and shows the ability to clear running lanes.  Talented special teams player who makes a lot of tackles on kick coverage.
-------------------------
Anthony_Dixon 497172 173
--NAME-- is a big, powerful back that runs with a good pad level and does a good job of keeping his feet alive to gain yards after contact.  He lacks the speed to be a threat out wide or to take many all the way once he gets to the second level but he will move the chains and sustain drives.  He can be a bit inconsistent when it comes to blocking but has the ability to deliver a good blow when he wants to.  He will likely initially be a short yardage or red zone back that specializes in gaining the tough yards.
His top end speed to be a threat on the perimeter or explode for long gainers up the middle is dubious.  Must improve his ball security as he?s shown he will put the ball on the ground at times.  Struggles getting to the outside.
--NAME-- is a big, bruising running back who was highly productive against premier competition in college.  Displays the necessary power to consistently break tackles.  Exhibits impressive balance on contact and is rarely brought down by the first tackler.  Shows nice foot agility for a big, power back.
-------------------------
Jonathan_Dwyer 497174 188
--NAME-- is a big, powerful ball carrier that has had a lot of production at Georgia Tech but some of the numbers could be inflated due to the style of offense the Yellow Jackets run.  The triple option tends to put ball carriers in wide open run lanes that won?t always be available to the pro style attack.  He is a one-cut ball carrier that will stick his foot in the ground and hit the seam at full speed.  He shows good balance on contact, runs through his share of arm tackles and shows surprising speed for his size.  He is the kind of back that most teams are looking for as a featured ball carrier but will need some work on the passing game as far as blocking or running routes out of the backfield.
Has outstanding size but can struggle to keep his weight down at times.  Played in an option system not often seen in today?s college game resulting in some inflated stats.  Lacks the elusiveness to turn nothing into something and make multiple defenders miss.
--NAME-- has an outstanding blend of bulk, size and speed for the position. Was highly-productive in college.  Shows a competitive fire and consistently battles for extra yards.  Flashes good blocking ability.  Has displayed some downfield receiving skills.  Very durable performer capable of carrying the load at the next level.
-------------------------
Toby_Gerhart 497176 51
--NAME-- is a big, powerful ball carrier that has just enough speed to be a threat.  He runs with a good pad level and consistently breaks through first contact and gets a lot of his yards after initial contact.  He seems to get stronger as the game wears on and defenses visibly grow weary of trying to take him on in the latter parts of the game.  He knows how to follow his blockers and is patient as he waits for the hole to open up.  He is an effective receiver out of the backfield and, while he is not apt to be used as a downfield threat, he can move the chains in the short to intermediate passing game.
--NAME-- does not possess the speed scouts like to see for the next level.  Does not effectively attack the perimeter on outside runs or kick it into another gear to hit home runs up the middle.  Attempts to get downhill in a hurry, but burst through the hole is just adequate.
--NAME-- has impressive size and strength for the running back position to be productive in between the tackles.  He has great balance on contact and consistently bounces off would-be tacklers.  Finishes his runs and fights for extra yardage.  Always plays with a ton of effort.  Was extremely productive in college.  Plays with a high level of intelligence.
-------------------------
Montario_Hardesty 497178 59
--NAME-- is an accomplished college runner that may struggle to bring the same kind of production to the next level.  He is not quite big enough to be a power back and lacks the all out speed and explosion to be a game breaker.  He does a good job of running behind his pads and shows balance on contact to break tackles and will fight for yards after the first hit.  He shows a decent burst through the hole but lacks a second gear to pull away once he gets to the next level.  He is a patient runner that does a good job of following his blockers and seeing things develop.
--NAME-- lacks the top end speed to be a home run hitter at the next level.  His lateral cutting range is only adequate further limiting his explosiveness and big-play potential.  Must improve his ability to sustain blocks in pass protection if he wants to remain on the field for third down.
--NAME-- possesses good size for the running back position.  Has good foot quickness and agility to get through the hole and make the first tackler miss.  Is a competitive player who will fight for extra yards.  Has good balance on contact to break tackles.  Is a patient runner with impressive vision.
-------------------------
Ryan_Mathews 497188 12
--NAME-- is a good sized running back that runs hard and shows a good burst through the hole.  He is a one cut runner that does not waste a lot of time dancing around in the backfield.  Once he gets past the first level he could use a bit more elusiveness in space as he has some straight line to him.  He tends to run a bit erect but does show upper body strength to stiff arm his way out of a tackle as well as balance on contact to stay on his feet and fight for extra yards.  He has struggled to stay healthy as he has missed time in each season at Fresno State.
Has enough elusiveness to make a tackler miss but isn?t a true threat as a space player.  Durability is a bit of a flag after --NAME-- missed games with a few different injuries in college.  Is very raw in the passing game.  Does not appear comfortable catching the football and will drop passes.  Doesn?t have enough experience in blitz pickup.
--NAME-- has outstanding bulk and size coupled with enough speed for the running back at the next level.  Has been extremely productive at the college level.  Highly-competitive performer who consistently battles for extra yardage.  Doesn?t have elite long range speed but shows an impressive burst through hole.
-------------------------
Dexter_McCluster 497190 36
Undersized for the running back position and may end up being a wide receiver or return specialist at the next level.  --NAME-- got a lot of all purpose yardage as a combination running back/receiver in Mississippi?s offense.  He has had ball security issues over the years and needs to prove he can avoid turnovers if he wants to prove a player his size can contribute.  He has the speed to turn a short dump off pass into a long touchdown with just a single missed tackle.  While he is a bit of a luxury item, some team is apt to take a chance that he can contribute in situations.
--NAME-- does not have the necessary size and strength to carry the load at next level.  Could struggle with his inside running but was willing and productive in college.  Blocking is an area of concern due to his lack of size and strength necessary to pick up blitzing linebackers.  May not break many tackles.
--NAME-- possesses elite speed and explosiveness for the running back position.  Has outstanding initial quickness needed to get through the hole.  Displays impressive receiving skills and can be a threat deep down the field.  Feisty player who loves to compete.  Has dangerous elusiveness in space, is a terror on the perimeter, and is a true home run threat.
-------------------------
Joe_McKnight 497192 112
--NAME-- is an elusive ball carrier that knows how to set up his blockers and does not need a huge lane to run through.  He enjoyed his first full season staying healthy in 2009 and declared early to take advantage of that.  He finishes his runs off better than you?d expect for someone his size.  He is not a power back but does know how to dip his pads to run through arm tackles and will attack tacklers with an explosive burst.  He shows a good burst through the hole and while he has good speed to threaten deep he will get run down from behind at times.  He can be an effective receiver both out in the flats as well as downfield.
--NAME-- has enough height but lacks the bulk and thick build of an every down back.  Doesn?t possess the natural strength to be consistently effective between the tackles.  Dealt with some minor injuries in college while sharing the load. Blocking could use some polish.  Isn?t a true power runner.
--NAME-- has elite quickness and agility for the running back position. Has good speed in the open field.  Shows impressive vision, waits for the play to develop, finds the cutback lane.  Very competitive with the ball in his hands and plays with the attitude of a bigger back.  Was productive in college.  Exhibits a natural feel setting up blockers.
-------------------------
Charles_Scott 497202 200
--NAME-- is a big, powerful back that is more of a raw power back that can move piles than an explosive punishing type of ball carrier.  He is a no-nonsense ball carrier that does not dance around in the backfield and is not apt to have many negative plays in the course of a game.  He missed the last three games of his senior year with a broken collarbone but it should not affect his draft status.  --NAME-- can be a punishing blocker but needs a lot of technique work for the next level.  He is an adequate receiver out of the backfield but won?t be much of a factor in the downfield passing game.
--NAME-- does not possess the speed to make big plays at the next level.  He lacks the elusiveness to make defenders miss in the hole or be a true threat on the perimeter.  He missed last three games of his senior year.  His overall receiving skills are questionable.
--NAME--?s game is all about size and power.  He?s an effective inside runner.  Shows good balance on contact and will consistently break tackles.  Is a productive player who can get stronger as the game wears on.  Displays good body control for a power back.  Is a high-effort guy.
-------------------------
C.J._Spiller 497204 9
--NAME-- is not the kind of back who can carry a team by rushing 20-25 times a game over the course of a 16-game season. Like a Reggie Bush or Felix Jones, though, he can be a situational player who  gives the offense big-play capability out of the backfield. He has a rare burst through the hole, and not many safeties can run him down once they lose the angle on him. He is a competitive runner who will fight for yards and has balance to bounce off hits and keep his feet to gain more yards. --NAME-- is apt to be the first back taken in the draft in spite of his lack of power and bulk.
Lacks the bulk to be a bell cow at the next level. Does not have the leg drive to be an effective short-yardage back.  Dances too much in the hole and has too many negative plays. Struggles to sustain blocks in pass protection.
--NAME-- is a super-explosive home-run threat with excellent speed. Has the vision and patience to find running lanes and the hands and body control to be an effective receiver. Possesses the foot quickness and agility to change direction on a dime and make people miss in space. Fiery kid who throws his body around and fights for extra yards.
-------------------------
James_Starks 497206 193
--NAME-- missed the 2009 season after undergoing surgery to repair his shoulder.  He is a converted running back and had consecutive thousand yard seasons in 2007 and 2008.  He has a little wiggle to him as he hits the hole and can veer off course after getting to the second level to make the first man miss but is not a top cut-back runner.  He has a good burst through the hole and shows the speed to take it all the way once he gets to the open field.
Does not run with the power we?d like to see for his size.  --NAME-- has some straight line to him and isn?t going to shake a lot of tacklers.  Durability is a concern after missing his senior year with injury.
--NAME-- has nice height, a good build and impressive overall size for a running back.  Has the necessary speed to be a threat on the outside at the next level.  Exhibits good acceleration and burst through the hole for a bigger back.
-------------------------
Ben_Tate 497208 58
--NAME-- is a hard-nosed runner that does not spend much time dancing around in the backfield.  He likes to stick his foot in the ground and hit the hole at the first sign of a running lane opening up.  He is a downhill runner that will veer off course as he gets through the hole but is not going to make a lot of people miss once he gets through the hole unless he can just outrun them.  He had been considered a bit of an underachiever in the past but came through with a big senior season to raise his status going into this draft.
--NAME--?s production was inconsistent and he shared the load until having a big senior season.  Can be caught at times making multiple cuts.  --NAME-- doesn?t possess elite size or power but also doesn?t have great elusiveness to make defenders miss or excel on the perimeter.
--NAME-- possesses a nice combination of size and speed at the running back position.  Is a competitive back who will deliver blows to defenders.  Shows good burst through the hole and usually doesn?t waste time in the backfield.  He has some impressive initial quickness.  Is a downhill runner.
-------------------------
Trindon_Holliday 497218 197
--NAME-- is an explosive return specialist who has the ability to take it all the way virtually every time he touches the ball.  He gets a quick jump on the ball as it comes off the kicker's foot and does a good job of settling under it to make the catch.  He has the kind of elusiveness that can make would-be tacklers grab air and knows how to set up his blockers.  He does have a tendency to rely on his pure speed alone and needs to learn how to alter his speed and save something in reserve.  With his speed and acceleration, he has a chance to be drafted late in spite of his lack of size and severe limitations as a wide receiver.
--NAME-- is very short at under 5-feet-6 and does not have the bulk to break tackles at the next level.  Starts too fast and does not show the ability to hold an extra gear for the end of the return.  Lacks the awareness and route-running ability to be a factor in the passing game.
Track star with blinding straight-line speed.  Explosive player who only needs a little seam to break a big return.  Reads the ball quickly in the air and gets underneath it fast.  Waits for his blockers to engage and finds running lanes.  Fluid through the hips and makes people miss in space.
-------------------------
Nate_Byham 497220 182
After being the top tight end in Pittsburgh?s program, --NAME-- had to split time at the position with fellow senior Dorin Dickerson.  --NAME--?s role became pretty much the blocking tight end with the occasional ball thrown his way to keep the defense honest.  He is not real quick or nifty on his release and labors coming out of his breaks, which will make it difficult to separate from defenders at the next level.  He should find a role in the NFL as a backup that can be used in two tight end situations as an extra blocker.
Does not possess adequate speed and is not explosive off of the line.  Lacks suddenness and struggles to gain separation in man coverage.  Limited experience as a pass catcher.  Times jumps poorly and is not a threat in the red zone.
--NAME-- is thickly built with soft hands and adequate body control.  Finds holes in zone coverage and is a tough runner after the catch.  Great blocker that generates a strong push and can climb to the second level.
-------------------------
Dorin_Dickerson 497222 227
--NAME-- is an athlete that has lined up everywhere from tight end to wide receiver to linebacker to fullback.  He has never taken a position and taken it over although he has shown flashes everywhere he lined up.  He will probably end up as a fullback/H back that is used in situations and can line up in a variety of positions.  He is athletic and catches the ball well but is not going to threaten many secondaries down the middle.  He has decent straight line speed as a fullback but lacks a big burst as he hits the hole.  He is not apt to be the kind of fullback that you want to be the lead blocker in a power running game.
Is not a refined prospect after playing three positions at Pitt.  Did not consistently produce at a high level in college.  Does not display the in-line blocking ability to be an every down tight end.  Didn?t show the top end speed to challenge defenses up the seam.
--NAME--?s a versatile talent with the size to be an effective NFL fullback or H-back.  Is a fierce competitor who gives a consistently high level of effort.  Is athletic to play some college wide receiver and figures to be capable of making some plays out of the backfield at the next level.
-------------------------
Ed_Dickson 497224 70
--NAME-- is an excellent receiving tight end that will give effort as a blocker but lacks the top size and bulk to be a dominating blocker at this level.  He is quick on his release and shows a burst coming out of his breaks to separate from defenders.  He has the downfield speed to stretch the middle of the field when running seam routes.  He can show a tendency to short-arm some passes when going over the middle and in traffic.  He has the speed and open field running skills to get a lot of yards after the catch.
Lacks necessary strength to be a factor in the running game at the next level.  Loses concentration sometimes on balls in traffic.  Raw and inconsistent as a route runner. Does not always demonstrate proper body position to get open in tight spaces.
Athletic and quick with good hip fluidity.  Makes impressive cuts and has very good body control.  Uses long arms to catch the ball away from his body and shows the ability to make the difficult grab.  Very competitive and runs well after the catch.
-------------------------
Jim_Dray 497226 233
--NAME-- is a good sized tight end, who needs to be brought in as a blocker first and a receiving threat second.  He oozes off the line and builds to his speed when running downfield routes.  He is athletic and has excellent ball skills but is not very quick or explosive in or out of his breaks and struggles to separate from defenders.  He can read coverages and can be an effective zone receiver, but his best chance of making a team is if he adds even more power and strength and makes an impression as a blocker. --NAME-- projects as a seventh-round pick or free-agent signing if not selected in this Aprils' draft.
Limited athlete who stays too high and struggles to change direction and make cuts.  Drops too many passes and is not explosive enough to stretch the field or make people miss after the catch. Missed significant time early in his career with a major knee injury.
--NAME-- is tall with a large frame and good bulk.  Releases fast and clean off of the line and finds soft spots in zone coverage. Uses size to get between defenders and the ball to make catches in traffic.  Maintains good footwork, takes good blocking angles and stays engaged to finish blocks.
-------------------------
Brody_Eldridge 497228 162
--NAME-- is a big, powerful blocking tight end who has very limited receiving skills and lacks the speed to be any kind of threat downfield. He has struggled to stay healthy for a full season and missed time due to a neck injury during his senior year. He also spent some time at guard to take advantage of his size and pass-blocking skills. He can be a powerful blocker once he gets his hands on opponents but also can be late off the snap and often gets beaten by quick defensive linemen. He could get a look as either an offensive lineman or tight end but will need time to develop.
Battled a neck injury as a senior at Oklahoma, and durability is a concern. Does not have the speed or ball skills to be a weapon as a pass catcher at the next level. Fires off the line a bit late and struggles to block more athletic defenders.
--NAME-- has ideal height and bulk. Very powerful blocker who generates a strong push and gets his hands inside the defender's pads. Effective pass blocker who was utilized at guard in college. Fights every play and shows a bit of a mean streak.
-------------------------
Dedrick_Epps 497230 235
--NAME-- was an on-and-off starter for pretty much his whole career at Miami, and while he has shown some consistency and play-making skills, he really does nothing that jumps off the screen at you. He is fairly athletic and can adjust to off-target throws to make difficult catches, but he also will drop some easy ones, as well. He lacks the speed and acceleration to be much of a threat down the seams. He is a more-than-willing blocker but lacks the size to be more than a finesse blocker who just gets the job done.  He should compete for a backup position but lacks the tools to be a front-line player at the next level.
Does not have the bulk to push around defenders at the next level. Lacks the top-end speed to stretch the field and make big plays. Limited burst makes it difficult for him to gain separation in man coverage. Loses concentration at times and drops too many catchable balls.
--NAME-- has soft, strong hands.  Shows good ball skills and high-points the football. Fluid athlete who possesses the body control to make difficult catches in traffic. Does not shy away from contact when blocking.  High-motor kid who fights to the whistle every play.
-------------------------
Garrett_Graham 497234 118
--NAME-- is a bit of a ?tweener in that he lacks prototypical size and strength to be a top in line tight end in the NFL.  He may be best suited as an H-Back or a fullback and will need to go to a team that fits his strengths.  He is a good route runner and is excellent at reading coverages and finding the soft spots in zone defenses.  He is a natural receiver that can reach out and pluck the ball and has a wide receiving radius.  He is a willing blocker but lacks the size to blow opponents off the line.
Does not possess adequate size and strength.  Releases too slow and does not have the acceleration to get separation in man coverage.  Lacks the moves to be elusive after the catch and the ability to stretch the field.
--NAME-- has soft hands.  Very productive for three seasons in the Big 10. Heady player with great motor.  Runs precise routes and understands how to get open in zone coverage.  Can play multiple positions at the next level.
-------------------------
Jimmy_Graham 497236 95
--NAME-- is a very raw tight end that left the basketball team to turn out for football in time for the 2009 season.  He is extremely athletic and has a huge upside but still needs a ton of technique work from running routes to blocking.  He is not restricted in his routes and shows a good burst coming out of his breaks to separate from defenders but at the same time struggles to get off the line vs. good press linebackers.  He shows strength when going for the ball in a crowd as well as flashes of strength as a blocker but can be sloppy in his footwork when he needs to adjust on the move when blocking in space.  He has received comparisons to Tony Gonzalez who played football and basketball at Cal but he is not as developed as Gonzalez was at the same stage.  He still needs to shed the basketball work ethic he came with.
--NAME-- lacks game experience with only one year of football under his belt.  At this time, work ethic as a pure football player needs to improve.  His toughness is in question as he still carries the basketball player label.  Blocking tenacity and overall technique need polish and refinement.
--NAME-- has an outstanding combination of size and speed for the tight end position.  A former basketball player, he shows impressive natural athleticism on the gridiron.  Despite limited experience, he has capable hands to make a play in traffic.  High-character guy.  Possesses tremendous potential.
-------------------------
Jermaine_Gresham 497238 21
--NAME-- will likely go later in the draft than he would have last year due to a season-ending knee injury in practice prior to the first game of the 2009 season.  He had surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right knee in October.  He lacks premier top end speed but can challenge secondaries down the middle thanks to his stride length.  --NAME-- is more of a finesse blocker in line but can and will smother opponents on the second level as well as down field.  There are times where it looks like he has lapses of concentration from his route running to missing blocks, but he is smart and can pick things up.
More of a long-strider than a burner. Erratic blocker with narrow base. Needs to work on route running. Loses focus at times. Missed the entire 2009 season with a knee injury.
Rare blend of size, speed and athleticism.  Vertical threat that consistently makes big plays and has a knack for getting into the end zone.  Big target with large catching radius and good hands that secure balls in traffic.  Possesses the body control to adjust to off target throws.  Good downfield blocker.
-------------------------
Rob_Gronkowski 497240 42
--NAME-- made an immediate impact when he arrived at the University of Arizona and has been a standout tight end when he has been healthy enough to stay on the field.  Unfortunately he has missed a total of 16 games over the past two years due to injuries or illness.  He has an elite combination of size, speed and athleticism for the position and while he lacks great downfield speed he can be an effective receiver at virtually all levels of the passing tree.  He is a tough, no nonsense type of blocker but still needs some work on his blocking techniques.  If he can stay healthy he could provide a team with a quality starting tight end.
Durability concerns since he missed the entire 2009 season after back surgery and missed three games in 2008.  Does not have a great top-end speed and may not be able to stretch the field at the next level.  Lacks the elusiveness to make people miss after catch.
--NAME-- has prototypical size and good speed.  Shows fluid hips and runs precise routes.  Possesses the lateral quickness and burst to get open in man coverage.  Catches the ball away from his chest and displays good body control.  Effective blocker that can generate a push.  Very productive in his two seasons in the Pac-10.
-------------------------
Aaron_Hernandez 497244 113
--NAME-- is a slightly undersized tight end that will best fit schemes that use an H-back as well as the traditional tight end.  He is athletic and shows good downfield speed when running vertical routes and does a good job of adjusting to balls when thrown slightly off target.  He has natural hand-eye coordination and consistently reaches out to pluck the ball.  He can struggle when physical linebackers line up over him to hinder his release and is more effective when lined up off the line of scrimmage.  He is not a very strong or physical blocker in line and takes questionable angles when blocking at the second level.
--NAME-- lacks the prototypical size we look for in tight ends at the next level.  We question his natural strength.  Blocking is a major area of concern and may limit him to the H-back role.  Isn?t strong at the point of attack and won?t consistently move defenders.
--NAME-- has impressive speed and athleticism for the tight end position.  Was extremely productive in college, earning first team all-conference recognition.  Has very natural ball skills, catches away from his body, can bring in off-target throws and can go up for the jump ball.  Great route running ability.  Is fluid and creates separation.  Productive after the catch.
-------------------------
Michael_Hoomanawanui 497246 132
--NAME-- has some physical skills but has struggled to show it on the field. He came to Illinois with a lot of expectations but suffered some sort of injury virtually every season. He has good size and flashes the ability to smother opponents when blocking on the edge but does not unload with much pop or punch and often lets opponents escape with minimal resistance.  He tends to round off his cuts and does not show much of a burst out of his breaks and struggles to separate from good man coverage.  He shows good hand-eye coordination and has a wide receiving radius.
Does not have the speed to stretch the middle of the field.  A bit stiff in the hips and loses momentum in and out of his breaks, which limits his ability to separate in man coverage. Rounds off routes too often and struggles to set up defenders with fakes. Had a litany of injuries in college.
Possesses great height and a thick, muscular build. Shows the ability to engulf defenders when blocking in the running game.  Has big, strong hands and catches the ball away from his body with ease. Very agile for his size and can find soft spots in zone coverage.
-------------------------
Anthony_McCoy 497250 185
--NAME-- is a good looking tight end that does not quite play up to his numbers.  He presents an excellent target and will go across the middle and catch the ball in traffic but lacks the explosive first step out of his breaks to separate from defenders on a consistent basis.  He rarely beats the offensive line off the ball and looks almost casual on his release, which could end up being an issue at the next level.  --NAME-- is not an easy take-down once the ball is in his hands, but is also not the most elusive runner in the open field.
Lacks initial quickness and releases late, making him slow off the ball.   Does not show adequate moves in the open field after the catch.  Struggles to push people around in the running game. Production never matched his abilities.
Possesses good size.  Has soft hands and good body control.  Runs efficient routes and can separate against man coverage.  Has enough speed to stretch the field.  Solid blocker with good technique.  Hard worker that fights for extra yards.
-------------------------
Dennis_Pitta 497254 114
--NAME-- is an older senior in that he has five years of football at BYU plus a two year mission which will put him at 25 during his rookie season.  He is more of a receiving tight end than a blocking or dual purpose one and will need some time to get used to lining up in a three point stance as BYU generally flexes their tight ends out in a two point stance.  He is not real explosive on his release and will need some work on escaping the press at the next level.
Lacks the bulk necessary to be a productive in-line blocker. Operated from a two point stance and will have to learn to release from the line.  Does not have the speed to spread the field at the next level.
Plenty big with very good hands and concentration.  Possesses rare body control and consistently shields defenders from the ball.  Runs precise routes and is very smooth in and out of breaks. Extremely productive in college.
-------------------------
Tony_Moeaki 497256 93
--NAME-- has been a bit of a disappointment since coming to Iowa as the top-ranked high school tight end in the country.  He has struggled to stay on the field as he has missed games in virtually every season of his career at Iowa.  He is a good athlete but lacks a second gear to stretch the secondary down the middle and lacks a big burst coming out of his cuts to separate from defenders.  He shows effort as a blocker but lacks the lower body strength to block with much power.  His best shot may be as an H-back or a tight end that is generally split out and lined up off the line of scrimmage.
Lacks adequate height and does not have much room to add bulk.  Limited top-end speed and agility prevents him from getting separation on his routes.  Struggles to find holes in zone coverage.  Does not have adequate power in his lower half and cannot drive defenders off the ball.  Missed too many games due to injury in college.
--NAME-- is a fluid athlete with soft hands.  Athletic enough to line up wide in a two point stance.  Maintains good body control and can adjust to throws away from his chest.  Very coachable, has a good attitude and plays hard to the whistle.
-------------------------
Andrew_Quarless 497258 154
After three years of inconsistency and off-the-field issues, --NAME-- finished off his senior year with 41 receptions and an excellent Bowl game against LSU where he caught a team-high eight passes.  --NAME-- had two issues with underage drinking, one in 2008 where he was charged for DUI and one in 2007.  He is a good sized TE with athleticism and body control going for him but needs to learn to take care of business in the offseason if he wants to impress coaches at the next level.  He does not block as strong as someone his size should and is not very aggressive when blocking in line.
Has concerns about work ethic and attention to detail.  Struggles to diagnose coverage and shed with his hands.  Despite size lacks good strength and slips off a lot of blocks.  Takes too many plays off.  Does not have the moves needed to be elusive in the open field.
--NAME-- has ideal size and bulk.  Very athletic for his size with fluid hips and a second gear to stretch the field.  Natural pass-catcher who can contort his body to make catches away from his chest and in traffic.
-------------------------
Arrelious_Benn 497270 39
--NAME-- is a big receiver with above average speed that can be equally effective catching the ball underneath and in traffic or on the deep seam routes.  He has good ball skills as well as leaping ability which allows him to go up and high point his catches when in traffic.  He will struggle to track and adjust to deep balls that are thrown off target.  He is a little stiff in his hips and tends to telegraph his cuts to defenders but shows a good burst coming out of his break.  He needs to refine his route running and setting defenders up but has enough talent to be a threat as a team?s second receiver.
--NAME-- is not real precise in his routes and will need a good amount of polish in this area for the next level.  Is an almost unusually thickly-built receiver prospect and has some stiffness in his hips, which further hinders his route-running.
--NAME-- has good height, tremendous bulk and good top-end speed for a receiver.  Is naturally athletic and comfortable getting the ball in a variety of ways including in the return game.  Shows good receiving skills, catches away from his body, can go up and get the jump ball and make highlight catches near the sideline.  Very dangerous after catch with his combination of size and speed.
-------------------------
Dezmon_Briscoe 497274 191
--NAME-- is a talented receiver that has been plagued with inconsistencies.  He builds to speed more than being explosive or instant but does show a gear to pull away once he gets even with defenders and can run down some deep balls.  He is not as physical or aggressive to the ball when in a crowd as you?d expect for someone with his size.  If he can mature both physically as well as emotionally he has a chance to become a quality second receiver.
--NAME-- needs to become a more consistent performer.  Isn?t overly sudden and builds to speed as he goes.  Doesn?t eat up cushions quickly.  Occasionally hears footsteps over the middle and gets alligator arms.  Needs to become more reliable catching the ball in traffic.
--NAME-- has really nice size.  Has been extremely productive in college.  Has a nice set of hands and can grab the errant throw, fight for the jump ball and extend and catch away from his body.  Is a surprisingly effective player after the catch.  Is natural with the ball in his hands, can make defenders miss, and has a natural feel for finding open seams.
-------------------------
Antonio_Brown 497276 195
--NAME-- is an extremely productive receiver from a relatively smaller level football program that could use another year in college to continue to develop physically.  He is undersized and will initially struggle with the physical aspects of the game at the next level.  He generally has lined up out of the slot and would have trouble with his release against some of the physical cornerbacks at the next level if he lines up on the line of scrimmage.  He is explosive off the line and will show a good burst out of his speed cuts but needs work on his hard cuts and underneath routes.  He has decent hands but it looks like the ball gets big on him at times and he traps too many passes in his body.
Lacks size.  Not tall and does not possess enough bulk at this time.  Needs to add strength to more effectively beat press coverage and battled for the ball in the air.   Route running skills could use some refinement.  Needs to become more consistent catching the ball in a crowd.
--NAME-- has a really nice combination of quickness and speed.  Has been extremely productive during his college career.  Shows very impressive initial quickness when exploding off the line.  Displays good agility as a route-runner and with the ball after the catch.
-------------------------
Dez_Bryant 497278 24
--NAME-- is an extremely talented receiver that has legitimate downfield speed as well as the ability to adjust to off-target throws.  He missed the final 10 games of 2009 for lying to an NCAA investigator and his ability to control and handle the off-field issues that could come up have to be in question.  He is extremely competitive to the ball when he is the target but sometimes shows a lackadaisical attitude when on the back side of plays or when asked to block.  He needs to be more precise on his route running and not round off his breaks on the hard cuts.  He could easily be the first receiver taken off the board if he can impress the personnel people in interviews.
There are some questions surrounding --NAME--?s maturity level.  Does not always show a high level of effort away from the ball.  Was able to get open with pure athleticism in college but needs to run more precise routes at the next level.
--NAME-- has a really impressive combination of size and speed.  Possesses the quickness and agility necessary to consistently gain separation as a route runner.  Very good ball skills, catches the ball softly away from his body and is outstanding at high-pointing the jumpball and really fights for the football.  Runs angry after the catch and is a load to bring down in the open field.
-------------------------
Riley_Cooper 497282 159
--NAME-- enjoyed an extremely productive senior year as he caught 51 passes for 961 yards in Florida?s spread offense.  He is a bit of a strider that builds to speed and can struggle when he needs to sink his hips to come out of his breaks with a big burst to separate from defenders.  He can struggle on his release against a good press corner and will need some work on running more precise routes.  He has baseball for an option but has stated that he wants to play football first and baseball as a backup.
--NAME--?s a guy who builds speed and is not explosive off the line.  Must improve his ability to gain separation as a route runner.  Long-term football future could be cloudy as he has other options (baseball).  Blocking could be better but --NAME-- does have the build and frame to make strides here.
--NAME-- possesses ideal height and bulk to play on the outside at the next level.  Is a high-character, two-sport collegiate athlete.  Plays with a high level of intelligence.  Athletic receiver for his size.  Shows the willingness to catch the ball over the middle in traffic.
-------------------------
Eric_Decker 497284 87
--NAME-- is a big receiver with small receiver skills.  He is quicker than he is fast and while he has enough speed he is not the type that will take many all the way to the house at the next level.  He runs crisp routes and will show a good short burst to separate from defenders but will struggle to maintain that separation.  He is a natural receiver that has soft, sure hands and a wide receiving radius that allows him to extend to catch slightly off target throws.  He missed the final four games of the regular season due to a foot injury but returned in time to play in the bowl game against Iowa State.
Lacks elite top end speed which could severely limit his big-play potential at the next level.  Lacks a second gear to pull away from defenders after the catch or in and out of his breaks against a corner capable of mirroring him.
--NAME-- possesses great size.  Was extremely productive in college.   Exhibits good quickness & agility which he uses to overcome lack of elite burst.  Gets off the ball quickly and is a savvy route runner.  Has excellent natural receiving skills.  Goes and gets the football, displays great body control in the air and around the sidelines, and isn?t afraid to go over the middle.
-------------------------
Marcus_Easley 497286 107
--NAME-- is a very raw talent who struggled on the bench for three years before bursting on the scene during his senior year at UConn.  He has a rare combination of size and straight-line speed and can make acrobatic catches.  The problem is --NAME-- does not appear to trust his hands and will not only drop some catchable passes but tends to let the ball get into his body to trap it rather than reach out to pluck it.  He is a bit of a strider and will need a lot of work on getting in and out of his breaks.  The nice thing is that he has a good chance to see some action on special teams. He was a core special-teams performer at UConn during his first three years as he tried to earn a scholarship.
Lacks confidence in his hands and drops too many catchable balls.  Does not sink his hips enough to maintain speed in-and-out of his breaks.  Runs sloppy routes and will struggle to get separation at the next level.  Only saw playing time as a senior and is a bit of a one-year wonder.
--NAME-- is a tall receiver with great bulk.  Long strider who possesses very good top-end speed.  Has big strong hands and good body control to make difficult catches in traffic.  Fierce competitor who seeks out contact on special teams and may contribute there early at the next level.
-------------------------
Jacoby_Ford 497288 108
--NAME-- is an explosive receiver that has a lot of skills but is a bit on the undersized side.  There were concerns about his hands as he likes to body catch a lot of balls but he showed pluck ability in the Senior Bowl practices this winter.  He definitely has long speed as he ran a 6.52 60-meter dash in the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships in March of 2009.  He has a tendency to rely on his track speed at times, and will need to work on altering how fast he runs his routes.  He probably fits the role of a slot receiver as a team?s Number 3 receiver.
--NAME-- lacks the prototypical size of a perimeter NFL receiver.  Is a raw route runner, who doesn?t always get in and out of his breaks smoothly.  Return potential is there, but return skills could use some refinement.  Despite his track speed, open field running could improve.
--NAME-- is a premier track athlete with excellent timed top-end speed.  Exhibited great foot quickness as a returner and running reverses in college.  Flashes the ability to adjust to off target throws and bail out his quarterback.  Was a very productive player whose team always tried to get him involved early and often.
-------------------------
Mardy_Gilyard 497292 99
--NAME-- is an excellent college receiver with top athleticism and above average acceleration and average speed and size for the next level.  He has been extremely productive in a passing offense but will need work on making his routes more precise as well as on his release off the line.  He is extremely dangerous once he has the ball in his hands and can be a threat to take it all the way with his running skills.  He can short arm the ball when he hears footsteps and will need to work on his receiving skills when in traffic.
--NAME-- has adequate height but lacks the bulk you like to see in a starting receiver and isn?t a good blocker.  Is quicker than fast and top end speed is only adequate ? won?t blow by many pro DB?s.  Hands are inconsistent.  Makes too many body catches.
--NAME-- is a very athletic prospect who was extremely productive in college.  Is a terror in the open field with the ball in his hands after catch.  Has the quickness and burst to separate from defenders when running short to intermediate routes.  Is a high-character guy on the field.
-------------------------
Brandon_LaFell 497302 78
--NAME-- is a big receiver that has a huge upside but still needs to refine his game if he wants to excel at the next level.  He has adequate speed for the position but with his size and stride length he can sneak up on and run by a lot of defenders.  He has soft, natural hands but will drop some balls due to lapses of concentration.  He is competitive to the ball over the middle and in traffic and can use his size and leaping ability to high point the ball over the top of defenders.  While he will initially have a bigger impact with the short passing game against zone coverage he has enough going for him to eventually become an effective downfield target.
--NAME-- possesses good top end speed but isn?t a true burner to consistently get deep at the next level.  Suffers from lapses of concentration which lead to drops.  Is not precise route-runner, is susceptible to press-coverage, and occasionally struggles to gain separation.
--NAME-- has the height and build of a starting NFL wide receiver.  Has been a productive player.  Has soft hands and flashes the ability to catch the ball away from his body.  Is an athletic receiver.  Exhibits the willingness to catch the ball in traffic over the middle.  Is a competitive performer who is tough to take down after the catch and will go up and fight for the jump ball.
-------------------------
Kerry_Meier 497308 165
--NAME-- is a converted quarterback that made the move to wide receiver his junior year to get on the field.  He is a good route runner that knows how to use his size to shield defenders from the ball and shows good strength to the ball when in a crowd.  He is a bit of a strider and can sneak by opponents by varying his speed and lulling them to sleep but lacks the top end speed to just run by people.  He is a little stiff and struggles to sink his hips and come out of his breaks with a big burst.  He lacks the speed and explosiveness to get a lot of yards after the catch.  He has a chance as a possession receiver but is not the type teams are looking for as potential starters.
--NAME-- lacks the top end speed desired from starting receivers.  Will not threaten defenses deep down the field.  Doesn?t have the explosiveness to eat up cushions.  Lacks the burst out of his breaks to separate.  Will not gain much after the catch.
--NAME-- possesses good height, prototypical bulk and outstanding overall size.  High-character prospect.  Excels reading coverages and converting routes to find the open spaces.  Displays good hands, plucks and quickly tucks away.  Uses his frame and wide catch radius to make plays in traffic.
-------------------------
Carlton_Mitchell 497310 177
--NAME-- brings a rare combination of size and speed to this draft.  He could definitely use another year in college but will be attractive to teams that are looking for a vertical passing attack thanks to his downfield speed and size.  He shows a good burst coming out of his speed cuts but will chop down too much and waste steps on hard cuts for underneath routes.  He has huge hands and can catch the ball in one hand at times but will try to catch too many passes in his body when he can.  He is willing to go across the middle and catch the ball in traffic and is a physical blocker on the perimeter.
--NAME-- is still a very raw prospect whose draft status could have improved with another year of seasoning.  At this time, he?s a poor route runner on short to intermediate routes.  He also likes to body catch and must do a better job of attacking the football away from his frame.
--NAME-- has an elite combination of size and speed for the next level.  Has big, strong hands.  His height and long-range speed make him a legitimate deep threat.  Has a ton of upside potential.  Is a ferocious blocker.  Will really compete for the football in traffic and isn?t afraid to take a big hit.
-------------------------
Taylor_Price 497316 90
--NAME-- has rare speed for a bigger receiver and has garnered a lot of attention as his senior season progressed.  He is explosive off the line and breaks down the cushion on defenders before they know it.  He can avoid the press and shows the ability to get in and out of his breaks with the kind of burst that separates from even the best of cover corners.  He makes acrobatic catches and looks very comfortable when reaching out to pluck the ball away from his body.  He still needs some work on setting defenders up and selling fakes, but there is a lot to work with on this guy, and some team is apt to take him earlier than the public expects.
Raw athlete who does not consistently disguise his routes, which neutralizes his excellent athleticism at times. Does not take the proper angles blocking and struggles to stick with defenders. Production has never matched his talent, even in a non-BCS conference at the college level.
--NAME-- has good size and possesses a great first step to consistently get early separation.  Fights through press coverage and sinks his hips well to get open out of breaks.  Has great body control and catches errant passes with ease.  Superior lateral agility makes him a threat to gain extra yards after the catch.
-------------------------
David_Reed 497318 156
--NAME-- will need work on is route running skills as he played out of a spread offense in Utah and is not accustomed to running precise routes.  He had an excellent week of practices at the East-West game and showed that he can be precise in his routes and sink his hips to get in and out of his breaks with a good burst.  He is a natural receiver that has a wide receiving radius and can adjust to off-target throws.  He needs to add bulk and strength for the next level but has shown enough to make you think he could contribute as a Number 3 receiver early on as well as returning punts and kickoffs.  While he is not a speed burner he does play the game with competitive speed.
Does not have the necessary bulk to fight off press coverage at the next level.  Comes from a spread offense and lacks experience running precise routes.  Struggles to find holes in the zone and get separation on underneath patterns.  Not overly elusive after the catch.
--NAME-- has solid height and an explosive release off the line of scrimmage.  Possesses great playing speed and sinks his hips to maintain momentum in and out of breaks and gain separation.  Has good hands and the body control to adjust to off-target throws.
-------------------------
Andre_Roberts 497320 88
--NAME-- is a dominating receiver at this level of football and has enough of the measurables to make you think he can make the transition to the next level.  He is explosive off the line and shows good straight line speed yet still can drop his hips and come out of his cuts crisply and with a burst to separate from defenders.  He has natural hand placement and a wide receiving radius to make catches when the ball is slightly off target.  He is elusive once the ball is in his hands and has enough speed to be a threat to take it all the way.  He will need a lot of work on reading more complicated coverage schemes and will have to learn how to beat the press against the NFL?s top corners.
--NAME-- was a very productive college receiver but at a lower level of competition.  Is quicker than fast and does not possesses elite top-end speed.  Lack of adequate height and speed could limit his potential as a vertical threat.
--NAME-- has good top-end speed.  Possesses outstanding quickness and burst allowing him to get in and out of breaks rapidly.  Has good, strong hands and very good receiving skills.  Is a dynamo after the catch and can really make defenders miss in the open field.  Can turn a short pass into a long gainer in a hurry.
-------------------------
Emmanuel_Sanders 497322 82
While --NAME-- is a slightly undersized receiver, he is certainly not timid when it comes to going over the middle and will compete for the ball.  Unfortunately, his lack of size and strength makes it difficult for him to win many of those battles.  He shows excellent acceleration off the line and can stretch the secondary down the seam with his vertical speed.  He is confident in his hands and will reach out to pluck the ball. However, he also will drop some when he tries to make a move before securing the catch.  He needs work on setting defenders up and can be a bit sloppy in his routes, but there is no reason to think he can't improve in that area.  He probably fits the Number 3 or 4 receiver description more than a Number 1 or 2, but he should be able to contribute early on as a return specialist.
--NAME-- is on the short side with less-than-adequate bulk.  Struggles to beat the press off the line and hold onto passes in traffic.  Will not out-muscle defensive backs for jump balls and is not a red-zone target.  Rounds off his routes too often and does not show the ability to use head fakes to gain separation.
--NAME-- has an explosive first step and very good top-end speed to stretch the field.  Drops his hips well and has the lateral agility to make plays in space after the catch.  Fluid athlete who flashes big-play ability in the return game.  Gutsy kid who will go across the middle and does not take plays off.
-------------------------
Jordan_Shipley 497324 84
--NAME-- has been a productive receiver at one of the top programs in the country for the past two years.  He had some durability issues early in his career with hamstring pulls and a shoulder injury but has not missed any games in the last three years.  He is explosive off the line and runs extremely crisp routes that allow him to separate from defenders with a good short burst.  He is a natural when it comes to adjusting to off-target throws and will go over the middle to catch the ball in traffic.  If he had better top end speed he would be pretty much the total package.
--NAME-- lacks premier top end speed, doesn?t have a ton of experience going deep and won?t really scare too many NFL DB?s as a vertical threat.  Durability is potentially a concern.  Suffered serious hamstring injury early in career and other minor ailments.
--NAME-- has enough size for the next level.  He?s an athletic player with really quick feet, which he uses to get open underneath and make plays after the catch.  Possesses elite ball skills.  Consistently catches the ball away from his body, will adjust to the bad pass, and is willing to go over the middle.  Is a heady route runner and gets open against zone coverage. Extremely competitive.
-------------------------
Golden_Tate 497326 60
--NAME-- has been a very productive receiver for the Irish over the past two years and will be coming out as a true junior.  He does a lot of things right and finishes games with a lot of stats but there is nothing physically about him that really jumps out at you.  He lacks premier size, speed and acceleration yet he manages to get open and make a lot of plays.  He is an excellent route runner that knows how to set defenders up and does not show much wasted movement when running patterns.  He does a great job of going to the ball when slightly off target and will compete for virtually every pass.  He is almost built more like a running back than a wide receiver but will fit some systems as a second or third receiver.
His overall explosiveness is questionable.  Is more of a speed-builder than a sudden guy, odd for a shorter receiver.  Takes a while to eat up cushions.  Top end speed is good but not elite.  Can get deep on occasion but doesn?t appear to be a consistent downfield threat.
--NAME--?s a strong receiver.  Is a very sound route runner who is smooth in and out of his breaks and has experience in a pro-style system.  Is dangerous after catch with a nice combination of quickness and power to break tackles.  Has been highly- productive.  High-character player who will always compete.  Has reliable hands.
-------------------------
Demaryius_Thomas 497328 22
--NAME-- has rare measurables for the wide receiver position and will be a very attractive gamble for some team after the first round.  He shows excellent vertical speed, especially for someone his size, and can be intimidating to a cornerback when isolated on the perimeter.  He has the size of a tight end with the speed, agility and ball skills of a wide receiver.  He needs a lot of work on his route running skills as he tends to round off his breaks and will telegraph his routes with too much upper body movement.  He can make acrobatic type catches but will drop some very catchable passes due to lapses in concentration.  He is not a very physical blocker on the edge in spite of his massive size advantage. In a recent workout, --NAME-- broke his foot and will be unable to participate in combine drills.
--NAME-- runs sloppy routes and is raw with his route-running in general.  Needs to be more consistent with his concentration on the ball.  Blocking must improve at the next level, which is tough to swallow given his size.  Can make strides in this area due to natural measurables. In a recent workout, --NAME-- broke his foot and will be unable to participate in combine drills.
Possesses elite size and physicality for the receiver position.  Has good top-end speed.  Has been productive in a system not overly friendly to receivers.  Really good catching the ball in a crowd.  Will rise up above defenders and shield players with his large frame.  Exhibits natural hands and consistently catches the ball away from his body.
-------------------------
Damian_Williams 497336 77
--NAME-- is a transfer from Arkansas to Southern Cal that enjoyed pretty much instant success since arriving in L.A.  He led the Trojans in receptions during his two seasons at USC and showed the kind of speed, agility and athleticism that makes him a threat to take it all the way once the ball gets into his hands.  He may lack premier top end speed but he does play the game fast and has a lot of agility and elusiveness in the open field.  He also brings the added value of being a quality punt returner to the next level.  He has struggled to make it through a full collegiate schedule healthy and his durability could be a concern for the next level.
--NAME-- has a slight build and questionable strength.  Can be overwhelmed by bigger, stronger corners at the line and when the ball?s in the air.  Durability?s a concern after suffering multiple injuries in college.  Has some fumbling issues.
--NAME-- is a speedy receiver with good height for the next level.  Very comfortable and effective running after the catch and has a lot of experience in the receiver screen game.  Does a good job with his route running.  Displays impressive ball skills and consistently extends to catch away from his body.  Excels gaining separation with his quickness and savvy.
-------------------------
Kyle_Williams 497340 206
--NAME-- is an undersized wide receiver with good punt-return skills and excellent vertical speed but is very raw when it comes to the finer points of running routes, reading coverages and setting defenders up. He gets to top speed quickly but can struggle trying to get off the line against a good press corner.  He tends to telegraph his routes and will round off his breaks on hard cuts, but he has the tools to improve with good coaching.  He definitely has something that can't be coached, and that is speed, which will cause teams to want to jump on him earlier than his production and skill level would dictate.
Does not have adequate size and will struggle to fight off press coverage at the next level.  Raw route-runner who struggles to find holes in zone coverage and make double moves.  Rarely disguises his routes, which neutralizes his game-breaking speed.  Will not be a capable blocker at the next level.
--NAME-- has blazing speed to stretch the field and make big plays. Explodes off the line and consistently gains separation in man coverage. Sinks his hips well to maintain speed in transition and is nightmare in the open field.   Great athlete who  can be a major weapon in the return game.
-------------------------
Mike_Williams 497342 101
--NAME-- is an extremely talented receiver that could come in and have an immediate impact as a deep threat as well as in the red zone.  Conversely he could also be a big-time bust if he comes in with the wrong attitude and is not willing to do the little things to make himself a top level receiver.  He is explosive off the line and can use his long legs and stride length to lull opponents to sleep and blow on by them.  He has shown the ability to extend and make acrobatic-type catches but will also body catch more passes than you?d like.  He was suspended for the 2008 season for academic reasons and then quit the team in November of 2009.
Serious character question marks after missing the 2008 season due to academics and quitting the team in November 2009.  Lacks true breakaway speed and struggles to make people miss after the catch.  Lets balls get too close and sometimes takes his eye off passes.
Tall receiver with a good frame.  Long-strider that is explosive off the line with fluid hips.  Punches out of press coverage and runs precise underneath routes.  Leaps well and is adept at high-pointing the ball which makes him a threat in the red zone.  Does not take plays off and is solid blocker.  Productive when he is on the field.
-------------------------
Joshua_Moore 497637 141
--NAME-- is a short, compactly built player with good athleticism and power. He doesn't have ideal footwork and agility for the cornerback position and is a bit of a 'tweener for an NFL secondary. He is inconsistent with his instincts and leveraging the ball in the open field. --NAME-- is tough and competitive but inconsistent as a run-support player. He could improve his overall play with better footwork and technique, as he does have decent speed once he transitions. --NAME-- has been productive over the past two seasons and can contribute as a rookie on special teams and as a nickel back in sub packages.
Does not use his feet efficiently, which slows him in and out of breaks and makes him a liability in man coverage.  Overall agility is lacking, which may force a move to safety.  Takes poor angles when tackling in the open field and does not have the instincts to consistently anticipate the play.
Strongly built athlete, who possesses good top-end speed.  Can give receivers a cushion and close fast.  Makes hits and does not shy away from contact.  Aggressive mentality makes him a good contributor on special teams.  Very productive in the Big 12.
-------------------------
Kyle_Wilson 79527 29
--NAME-- is an athletic versatile player that has immediate value giving depth to the secondary as well as contributing as a return specialist. He is aggressive to go after the ball as a coverage defender as well as fielding punts and kicks. --NAME-- understands angles and how to leverage the ball that may fit best in combination zone schemes. He shows good vision and instincts to find a crease as a punt returner. --NAME-- lacks great top end speed but shows excellent quickness and hips to be effective as a nickel defender. He is a willing run support player but isn?t physical and needs to improve in this phase of the game. --NAME-- is a good football player that should contribute in a rookie season and eventually vie for a starting position.
Only possesses average size and can have trouble dealing with bigger receivers.   --NAME-- is willing but inconsistent in run support and misses some tackles. Despite impressive ball-skills, he needs to get his head turned around when in man coverage and locate the ball better in the air.
--NAME-- is a fast-twitch corner who possesses tremendous athleticism. He?s a durable performer who did not miss any games while at Boise State. Instinctual player who displays great anticipation in pass coverage.  Possesses impressive ball skills. Also a candidate to help out in the return game, which only increases his value.  Did nothing but produce for the Broncos.
