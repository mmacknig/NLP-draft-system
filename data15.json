                    "Bottom Line": "Gallik won't win many footraces and he might not look as good in the uniform as some others will, but he's a street fighter in knee braces and he has the power to handle himself when covered by a 3-4 front. Starting-caliber center in a power running game.",

Sinks hips and times his punch in pass protection. Keeps his head out of the pass protection and uses good posture. Nasty. Has the play demeanor that offensive line coaches love. Has necessary sand in his pants to stalemate against power and does a good job of getting his feet in position to wall off defenders. Very good functional strength. Can sustain power blocks.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Gets a little bit high out of the snap. Linebackers have ability to slip his blocks when he climbs to the second level. Limited athletically and loses a great deal of his effectiveness outside of his snap area. Will spend too much time securing first space when asked to pull.",

Uses good hand placement and has natural timing with hands. Converted defensive tackle who will continue to improve in the NFL with more experience at center. Displays good snap-to-step quickness. Uses quickness to attack defender and begin his grind much earlier than when he played tackle. Competes and is a willing learner. Can get to second level and make cut-off blocks. Has athleticism to pull and offers versatility along the line.",
                    "Weaknesses": "High-cut with tapered lower body, lacking power in legs. Pops straight up in pass rush. Susceptible to bull rush. Had issues handling the edge speed of Clemson's Vic Beasley in 2014 and his days of playing tackle are likely over. Relies on lean rather than hip thrust to generate power.

Has big hands and is tough at the point of attack with good functional strength. Loves to play and is a willing worker, according to personnel men. Reestablishes hands into proper placement in pass pro if defender gets hands into his chest. Can pull and hit targets in space. Adjusts to mirror and engage linebackers on second level. Consistently gets to reach blocks.",

Handles power players pretty well at point of attack but tends to lose balance when engaging the same players on the move. Marginal acceleration around the corner when asked to pull.

Uses the boundary effectively. Doesn't shy away from tackling. Competitive and won't prematurely open up out of fear. Tracks the ball effectively and has plus ball skills. Mentally tough and twitchy.

Has a habit of rerouting downfield in off coverage, which will turn into penalties in NFL. Struggled to keep Stanford WR Ty Montgomery in front of him as a cornerback. Opens hips too quickly in coverage and doesn't have twitch to burst back upfield. Struggles to find and track ball consistently.

Works his way back to the ball and gets open during scrambles. Consistently high-points his catches and is a snatch-and-secure receiver. Recognizes when to adjust depth of routes over the middle. Has an innate feel for the position. Proved he could come back from injury and regain his form. Maximizes his catch window through body control, extended hands and positioning.",

Routes are inconsistent and sometimes lack sharpness. Noticeably slower after returning from a broken bone in his foot in 2014. Quick-twitch corners could be his kryptonite.

Has fast, violent hands with advanced understanding of how to use them. Tough and plays with bad intentions on each snap. Uses rip to get under linemen and out-leverage them. Played 4-3 defensive right end in base but rushed from three-technique in some sub-packages. Once he gets to blocker's edge, they struggle to recover and redirect. Rare ability to post inside leg and get his body turned sharply and quickly around it toward quarterback. Excellent change-of-direction talent. Has natural coordination of head fakes, footwork and hand usage in pass rush. Works hard to stand his ground against power. Has power in upper body and hips to punch and dispatch with tight ends against run. Rarely runs past the arc as a rusher and will fight to come back underneath if he gets on the high side. Was able to drop into space with no issues when asked.",

Can get too focused on hand fighting if he doesn't win with hands early in pass rush. Will occasionally stunt himself out of a play, opening up running lane. If rushing from inside, must learn to set up teammates when running \"T/E\" (tackle first, end under) twists. Relies on arm-over inside and slap/rip outside -- needs more variety to pass rush.",

Wants to dominate and gets surly when beaten on a snap. Special foot quickness in pass protection. Able to mirror and counter two-way rushers or B-gap blitzers.

Hands ride too high and too wide. Content to become grabby around framework of defender. Flagged for six holding penalties over last two seasons. Slow to secure and climb on combo blocks and is often lacking balance on the way to target. Doesn't bring feet under him to sustain second-level blocks.

Has to learn when to keep run play-side and improve patience to allow back-side cutback lanes to develop. Can improve as receiver out of backfield. Wasn't always in position to scan defense on screen passes, resulting in lost yardage. Pad level often a little high into contact. Not much of a tackle-breaker and allows his base to get too narrow, giving defenders a chance to end play prematurely. Less creative than most of the top-level backs in this draft.

Adequate accuracy and ball placement from the pocket. Able to make off-balance, difficult throws. Can uncork throws quickly and without resetting feet when necessary. Can climb the pocket and deliver strikes when he trusts the edges of his protection. Silky smooth when asked to roll out and delivers on time with sound mechanics. Has balance and feet to escape collapsing pocket and will look to strike through the air rather than just bolting as a runner. Size, speed and enough skill to eat in the red zone.

Stepped into sacks he had no business taking. Didn't have to throw to tight windows often. Average processor on field. Still learning when to get rid of the ball and move to next play. Slow to make anticipatory throws and can improve patience in allowing combo routes to mature rather than rushing the read. Missed obvious pre-snap blitzes. Drive accuracy needs work.

Speed to chew up cushion and open a throwing window over the top. Will threaten seam and dominated defenders on wheel routes. Red-zone winner. Can do damage after the catch and shows playmaking aptitude with tight end screens. Extends and goes all out for the catch. Got a foot inbounds on three circus catches.

Needs to do better job over deep middle of using frame to shield throw from safeties. Won't generate push as an in-line blocker and has limited feel and instincts as a move blocker.

Had 40 runs for 15-plus yards in 2014. Shifty in open field without having to hesitate. Uses jump-cut at line of scrimmage to change gaps and avoid tacklers. Has an effective spin move to make defenders miss in open field. Great agility and plus balance hurdling opponents diving at his legs. Feet keep moving in tight spaces, probing for daylight. Able to consistently beat college defenders to flank. Loves to run over the tackles. Shows ability to create for himself and has burst and agility to turn small gain into big one.

Held to \"stuffs\" -- runs resulting in no yards or a loss -- on 19.2 percent of his carries. Feel and instincts as interior runner need improvement. Shows indecisiveness as one-cut runner. Would gear down and stutter-step to line, waiting for crease to show itself rather than adjusting on fly and taking what was available. Play strength through hole was only average. Used speed over strength to create many missed or broken tackles. Benefited from gaping running lanes. Ball security was an issue. Fumbled six times over his final five games, often being stripped while finishing run. Uncomfortable pass-catcher with marginal hands. Either dropped, double caught or smothered many throws.

Uses quick, tight steps to second level. Will sink and explode into tackler or side-step and jet, causing hesitation in downhill safeties with their approach. Converts \"speed to power\" between tackles and around corner. Rarely looks to run out of bounds and finishes his runs. Able to factor out of the backfield with soft hands and ability to adjust to throws. In 2014, churned out an amazing 61.9 percent of his rushing yardage after contact.

Has natural feel for throwing windows and anticipates openings that other college quarterbacks don't see. Has height to see over offensive line and thickness of build to withstand NFL hits. Big arm by NFL standards. Gets full extension and follow through into throws with ability to drive ball into the seam in front of safeties. Can make all of the field-side throws teams need. Most teammates very trusting and protective of him, according to regional scouts. Aware in pocket, but not overly jittery. Good feel for edge pressure and steps up into pocket while continuing his scan. When pressure mounts, so does his focus. Shows faith in his wide receivers and willing to go right back to them after a drop. Strong lower body and able to shake free of some would-be sacks and get rid of the ball. Fierce competitor and unafraid of mistakes. Shows above-average football character. Will make throws and take chances others won't, which can be a special trait if properly harnessed.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Decision making not consistent with his football intelligence. Will throw into impossible windows rather than taking safe throw underneath. Elongated windup and release allows instinctive defenders to close on throws. Was too easily baited into dangerous throws. Struggled with intermediate passing game in 2014, completing 56.8 percent of his passes with FBS-leading 11 interceptions in that range. Still learning nuances of position and how to move and hold defenders with his eyes. Would sleepwalk through first half of many games. Inconsistent footwork and weight transfer caused balls to sail. Prone to emotional outbursts on field. Quality of decision-making drops off substantially when pocket becomes turbulent and he's forced to leave it.

Able to shed blockers with hands or with clubbing arms and spring into ball carrier. Can two-gap at the point of attack and plays square throughout, leveraging gap when offenses try to block him on an angle. Bull-rusher with ability to invert pocket, ringing up six sacks over last two seasons.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Scouts consider him incomplete as a player due to his lack of consistent pass rush. Marginal burst upfield. Square rusher who hasn't learned to get to shoulder of the guard consistently yet. Rushes with leg stiffness and plays too tall when attacking. No pet move to create an opening. Scouts have questions about whether or not he can be an explosive penetrator in a 4-3 front.",

Desired awareness in zone with extended playmaking range. Will make plays outside of his area and has speed to come across field to chase down a loose running back or receiver. Able to redirect from press coverage and will only get better with more coaching. Leaper with the ability to challenge and win 50/50 throws. Buys in and does his part in run support.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Only 10 career starts. Plays with talent over technique. Needs to improve patience in press coverage rather than opening up too early. More of a straight-line burner than fluid, change-of-direction athlete. A little stiff-hipped and is a tick slow to open and accelerate. Plays with build-up speed over instant gas. Inconsistent to turn and find/track the ball. Not a naturally aggressive, physical player. Can hit with force, but doesn't go out of his way looking for it.

Plays with desired footwork. Can sit down and shift weight properly to drive the intermediate throws. Played in pro-style offense and is comfortable with 3-, 5- and 7-step drops from under center. When protected, shows confidence to stand and deliver with accuracy to all areas of the field. Trusted by head coach Mike Riley to make pre-snap reads and audible.

Phone-booth mauler. Shoots his strong hands inside and fights to keep them there. Features power, body control and hand placement to win early in the snap. Usually recognizes twists, coming off initial block to pick up twister. Despite gentle demeanor off the field, is willing to mix it up and turn a snap into a fistfight if need be.

Above-average foot quickness to escape pocket. Hit 57-yard playaction touchdown from under center against Washington in 2014 (just seven attempts under center all year).

Internal clock is a mess. Has marginal anticipation, and appears to be lacking in ability to read defenses and create a pre-snap plan. Slow getting through progressions, taking 125 sacks in three years. Inconsistent weight transfer on throws, which affects accuracy (throws sail) and velocity. Needs to reset feet when swiveling from side to side while scanning for next target. Gets crowded in pocket rather than sliding to open space. Short-arms too many throws. Ineffective, inaccurate passer outside of pocket with lowest completion percentage in Pac-12 when scrambling (32.6 percent).

Lines up defense and does a solid job of covering tight ends, despite lack of height. Diligent in coverage to make up for lack of athleticism. Plays with bend and plus play strength, and fights through blockers to chase and finish tackles. Always sniffing at the ball with 89 tackles, eight passes defensed, three interceptions and a forced fumble in 2014.",

Allows excitement for the game to overcome him at times. Can get lost in coverage when plays break down and scramble ensues. Blitzing machine with limited coverage responsibilities, often locking in on tight ends and as a very deep, single-high safety.",

Always gets over the top of cornerbacks on verticals. Varies route speed and has ability to body up and box out smaller cornerbacks downfield. Explosive leaper with timing and catch radius to make the difficult catches look easy. Shows off plus body control and ball tracking on deep ball.

Redirected in his routes more than expected for receiver his size. Disappointing hands that might always haunt him. Slow catch readiness, allowing too many throws to beat him up.

Gets too committed to recover effectively against a double move. Relies on grabbing and downfield mauling that won't be allowed in NFL. Atrocious outing vs. Rutgers, giving up six catches for 162 yards and three touchdowns. Inconsistent play speed on tape. Inconsistent demeanor in run support.

Highly instinctive in space with consistent feel for working his way to open spaces as a presentable, ready target. Almost always works his way back to the throw when needed. Natural hands.

Flashes winning spin move in pass rush, but needs to learn to set it up better. Uses arm-over inside move to set up tackles for loss. High-end tackle production for his position. Secondary motor to pursue and speed to chase leads to more tackle opportunities. Lead all SEC defensive linemen in \"stuffs\" (tackles for no gain or loss of yards) with 17.

Does his job in run support, playing with leverage against perimeter runs and containment on back side. Coming from high to low, can mirror running back movement to shadow and hit.

Excellent body control to adjust to throws, whether they're low, high or behind him. Can make contested catches. Dynamic and dangerous with the ball in his hands. Sudden once he's in space, using head fakes and impressive lateral change of direction to make multiple defenders miss. Instant acceleration is his differentiator from the slot.

Gives moderate effort as a blocker, but rarely ends up getting his man blocked. Had season-ending injuries two years in a row (broken leg and lacerated kidney).

As base-blocker, hustles feet into position and works to wall defender off. Has desired foot quickness combined with proper angles to be effective blocker on play side and back side on stretch plays.

Shows ability to become a more effective route runner on next level. Plays with excellent ball tracking and was able to go up and make contested catches on 50/50 balls downfield. Hands-catcher.

Added more than 20 pounds before the 2014 season, and showed improved play strength on tape. Highly intelligent with ability to process and recognize. Does adequate job of rolling hips at contact to create leverage. Manages to seal the edge against pass rushers at the last moment and will push rushers around the arc.",
                    "Weaknesses": "Plays with sloppy hand placement in run and pass. Lacks power to snatch and sustain blocks with consistency. Ducks head into contact, losing sight of target. Plays with some knee stiffness. Struggles to gain much ground with overly tight kick slide and finds himself behind too often. Lacks desired power in lower half as a run blocker.

Uses a balanced pass set and avoids the waist-bending and head-butting seen from many linemen at point of contact. Uses a well-timed punch and won't show length-limited punch too early. Good feel for landing accurate initial strike in pass pro or run game. Has some straight-line quickness and can get out into space in screen game.",

Busts it in the weight room. Shows power in his hands and upper body to strike a blow against second-level blockers and keep himself clean. Extremely rangy playmaking ability. Agile in his scrape and generally avoids trash at his feet. Former safety who has long speed to stick with running backs out of the backfield. Transitions forward with control and is a wrap-up tackler.",

Can be seen sprinting back into coverage on run plays and will drift around lost in zone coverage at times. Slow to diagnose and attack. Will take a poor angle into his run fit and lose leverage. Wyoming kept coverage as basic as it could for him.",

Has all the tools to become a good edge-setter as a pro. Shows ability to see past a blocker and win quickly with his hands. Too strong for most tight ends to block. Has plus burst to the ball when it is in his sights. Plays with speed and single-minded focus once he cuts it loose. Has athleticism to dip shoulder and turn a tight corner as pass rusher.

Ready to come off his man to overlap and contest a catch or make a tackle. Digests combo routes and helps teammates lineup before snap. Recognizes route development and makes early break on throws. Ball-tracker with excellent timing to high-point and disrupt the catch. Lack of on-ball production tied to quarterbacks avoiding him.

Will occasionally lose track of his man in scramble situations. Not a hitter. Scouts question his toughness. Will get muscled by bigger receivers. Ducks head as tackler and prefers to hit with helmet over wrapping up against running backs. Will lose interceptions to his below-average hands.
